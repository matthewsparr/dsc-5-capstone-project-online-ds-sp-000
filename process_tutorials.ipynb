It is inadvisable to be reading this if you\\\\nhaven\\\\\\'t looked at the general in-game hints (type \"HINT\" during the\\\\ngame), and even then this document should be used sparingly. The game is\\\\nhard, but try to solve as much of it by yourself as you can, yeah?\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll feel better about yourself.\\\\n\\\\nThis solution is explained by sections.\\\\n\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n\\\\nTHE MANDRILL -- Keeping him out of your hair\\\\n\\\\nGenerally whenever the mandrill enters your corner of the cage or you\\\\nenter his, you have one turn to act before he does you in. Early on you\\\\ncan avoid death by simply moving to a differenct corner of the cage\\\\nwhenever he approaches. After no sooner than 50 turns into the game the\\\\nmandrill will become more aggressive, chasing you almost every turn.\\\\nTemporary methods of fending him off, such as throwing dirt at him or\\\\nhiding under the bed, may give you a quick breather, but you need a\\\\nlong-term solution. There are two...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE HORNETS -- Dangerous when aggravated\\\\n\\\\nThe hornets will mind their own business just as long as you don\\\\\\'t go\\\\ncasting a stone at their nest, at which point they will fly all about,\\\\nattacking both monkeys and you. From this time on both the chimpanzee\\\\nand mandrill will do nothing but run around wildly. This is good in the\\\\nsense that the mandrill no longer poses a threat to you, but bad in the\\\\nsense that the chimpanzee can no longer help you. Therefore you must\\\\nwait until you no longer need the chimpanzee before taking this course\\\\nof action, because there is no way to recall the hornets. (If the game\\\\nbecomes unwinnable when you throw the rock at the nest then you still\\\\nneeded the chimpanzee to do something)\\\\n\\\\nHow do you survive the hornets yourself? Hiding under the bed is only a\\\\ntemporary solution. To protect yourself for good you\\\\\\'ll need to cover\\\\nyourself with a sheet or a blanket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE FIRE -- Ins and outs of taming flame\\\\n\\\\nNeither the mandrill nor chimpanzee will enter any corner of the cage\\\\nwhere fire or smoke is if they can help it. In order to build a fire you\\\\nwill need flint, steel, and tinder. The stone serves as flint. The\\\\nbarbecue fork, the bucket, or the fan serves as steel. The sheet,\\\\nblanket, or jersey can be used as tinder. Obviously, to keep the fire\\\\ngoing you\\\\\\'ll have to keep feeding it with flammable objects.\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to build the fire in the southwest corner of the cage, you\\\\nhave the advantage of being able to use the fan to blow smoke (when the\\\\nfire is large enough to produce sufficient smoke) to one of the other\\\\nthree corners. By rotating the fan you can steer the mandrill out of any\\\\ncorner of your choosing. In addition, the fire will last longer when the\\\\nfan is on.\\\\n\\\\nThe risk you take when you build the fire in the southwest corner is\\\\nthat it might catch to your bed. If this happens you must act quickly.\\\\nPut out the fire by throwing or kicking dirt onto it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE BUCKET -- Don\\\\\\'t kick it yourself, let somebody do it for you\\\\n\\\\nHow do you get the bucket off the platform? There is no way to get atop\\\\nthe platform yourself. Only the chimpanzee can, but he needs an\\\\nincentive to go there. Hmm, I wonder what that might be. Yes, toss the\\\\nbanana onto the platform. The chimpanzee will soon jump after it,\\\\nknocking the bucket off inadvertently. The bucket will land in the\\\\nsouthwest corner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBUILDING THE PULLEY -- It\\\\\\'s the only way to open the gate\\\\n\\\\nThe solution to Three Monkeys One Cage in a nutshell is to set up a\\\\npulley system in which the cord is slung over the bar that protrudes\\\\nfrom the wall, with a bucket attached to the end of the cord. The other\\\\nend of the cord is already attached to the top of the gate permanently.\\\\nWhen a weight falls into the bucket, the bucket descends, causing the\\\\ngate to rise.\\\\n\\\\nThe cord can be tied to various objects, then thrown over the bar. It is\\\\nnot enough simply to tie the cord to the bucket, for you\\\\\\'ll find out\\\\nthat the cord is short by just a tiny margin when the weight falls and\\\\nmisses it. You must first tie the cord to a hook, then once the cord is\\\\ndangling from the bar you must get the bucket hanging from the hook\\\\nsomehow. A hook can be found underneath your bed.\\\\n\\\\nThe only way to get the bucket onto the hook once it has been slung over\\\\nthe bar is to lift it using the barbecue fork.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nACTIVATING THE PULLEY -- Getting the weight to drop\\\\n\\\\nOnce your pulley is all set up you are ready to drop the weight in the\\\\nbucket. If you haven\\\\\\'t guessed already, it is a coconut that must be\\\\nused for the weight. Have the chimpanzee get one for you. (CHIMP, CLIMB\\\\nTREE followed by CHIMP, GET COCONUT)\\\\n\\\\nThe coconut must roll down the trough, which you cannot reach yourself.\\\\nYou need the chimpanzee again for this. (CHIMP, PUT COCONUT ON TROUGH)\\\\nIf the coconut isn\\\\\\'t staying on the trough properly, that is because you\\\\ndid not remove the husk. You can crack it open with the stone or with\\\\nthe barbecue fork.\\\\n\\\\nJust because the coconut is on the trough does not mean that it will\\\\nroll automatically. The trough must be inclined. You can use the\\\\nbarbecue fork to raise one end of it. At last, the coconut will fall\\\\ninto the bucket and the gate will open! (If the coconut isn\\\\\\'t landing\\\\nsquarely in the bucket, read the previous section carefully)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGETTING OUT ALIVE -- How to leap a great distance and live to tell\\\\n\\\\nAfter you\\\\\\'ve gotten the gate open there is still more puzzle left to be\\\\nsolved. The distance to the ground below is too great to jump, yet jump\\\\nyou must. But you\\\\\\'ll need to make some preparations. To begin with, you\\\\nmust use the cord again in a different way. You need to hold onto it, or\\\\ntie it around your waist when you leap outside. The dilemma is in the\\\\nfact that the cord can only be used for one purpose at a time; it can\\\\\\'t\\\\nbe tied around your waist while it is being used for the pulley. Were\\\\nyou to remove the bucket from the hook with the barbecue fork, then pull\\\\naway the cord, the gate would go back down. Thus you must keep the gate\\\\nopen another way while you remove the cord from the bar. Do this by\\\\nplacing an object in the opening to hold the gate up. Namely, the\\\\nbarbecue fork.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDISMANTLING THE PULLEY -- But only once you no longer need it\\\\n\\\\nThe gate\\\\\\'s open and you need that cord again. But the barbecue fork\\\\nwhich could otherwise be used to remove the bucket from the hook is no\\\\nlonger available. How do you retrieve the cord? This is perhaps the most\\\\ndifficult part of the puzzle, and it requires some timing. The fact is\\\\nthat you DO need the fork for this. Before placing it in the gate you\\\\nmust use that versatile tool in one more capacity--as a torch. The\\\\nbarbecue fork can be used to lift burning objects out of the fire, such\\\\nas the jersey, or the banana peel, or the coconut husk. You can then\\\\n\"light the fuse\" by touching the torch to the cord. Then, before the\\\\ncord snaps, extinguish the burning object and wedge that fork in the\\\\ngate, as explained above.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE FINAL STEP -- Before you can fly the cage\\\\n\\\\nUsing the procedure described in the previous two sections, you can\\\\nalmost survive that drop. One more precaution need be taken in order for\\\\nyou to fall the remainder of the distance without injury. You must\\\\ncushion your fall. Throw as many object out the cage as you like, but\\\\nthe only one that will make any difference is the mattress. Be aware\\\\nthat you can\\\\\\'t pick up the mattress while you\\\\\\'re carrying other things.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE ANVILS -- Death from above\\\\n\\\\nAfter precisely 100 turns into the game, panels on the ceiling will open\\\\nup to release heavy anvils. A falling anvil will most certainly crush\\\\nyou in five turns unless you take cover by hiding under your bed.\\\\nWhereupon the anvils will cease, and bombs will begin dropping in their\\\\nstead. When the bombs start dropping you have only nine turns left to\\\\ncomplete the game, so act quickly! There is no way to outlive the bombs\\\\nsave by completing the puzzle and escaping from the cage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\nIs Three Monkeys One Cage a fair puzzle?

General Questions\\\\n--------------------\\\\n\\\\nCan I restore my saved games without having to wait?\\\\n\\\\n - With the MS-DOS version, you can change your computer\\\\\\'s time to\\\\n   be more than 30 minutes past the save time. Or you can change the time\\\\n   in the save file to be earlier. Changing the byte at position 0C (hex) \\\\n   to a value of 0 always seems to work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m dying of thirst? What do I do?\\\\n\\\\n - Drink some water.\\\\n\\\\n - There are various places in the game (including the building) that\\\\n   make good water sources. You can also carry one drink\\\\\\'s worth in the\\\\n   bottle.\\\\n\\\\n - And the flask also takes a small amount of water.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m running out of light! What can I do?\\\\n\\\\n - You could make sure you finish the game before your lantern dies.\\\\n\\\\n - You could buy some batteries in the \\\\\\'all different\\\\\\' maze.\\\\n\\\\n - You could use the appropriate magic words. They will give your lamp\\\\n   a one-time boost good for several hundred moves.\\\\n\\\\n - Harnessing electricity is a kind of sorcery.\\\\n\\\\n - There are a couple of words you may have seen that suggest a famous\\\\n   person often associated with electricity.\\\\n\\\\n - They\\\\\\'re found in the Sorcerer\\\\\\'s Lair. Type them as separate commands.\\\\n\\\\n - Don\\\\\\'t do it until your lamp is out of power.\\\\n\\\\n - Drop your lamp first. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do about these little dwarves?\\\\n\\\\n - If you could just get them on your side, you could have one heck\\\\n   of a party.\\\\n\\\\n - But they\\\\\\'re set in their ways. \\\\n\\\\n - The first dwarf that attacks you drops an axe. Get it, then throw it\\\\n   whenever there are dwarves attacking you.\\\\n\\\\n - Throwing the sword works too, as does just waving it about.\\\\n\\\\n - Eventually, you\\\\\\'ll also learn a magic word that you can use to defeat\\\\n   them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA pirate stole my treasure. How can I get it back?\\\\n\\\\n - Actually, you need this to happen, or you won\\\\\\'t be able to get his\\\\n   treasure chest.\\\\n \\\\n - After he steals from you, go find his chest in the \\\\\\'all alike\\\\\\' maze.\\\\n   He won\\\\\\'t steal from you after you get it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat should I do with the dwarf\\\\\\'s horn?\\\\n\\\\n - A bunch of dwarves attack you when you blow it.\\\\n\\\\n - The right magic word might get rid of them.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s handy for getting back any treasure stolen by the dwarves.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s easier if you wear some protection.\\\\n\\\\n - And a magic way to get rid of the dwarves helps too, just be\\\\n   careful you follow the instructions.\\\\n\\\\n - Then again, you could call the owl instead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nB. Above Ground\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\nWhat am I doing here?\\\\n \\\\n - As an adventurer of some ambition, you are trying to collect a bunch \\\\n   of treasures in the small brick building without getting killed.\\\\n\\\\n - If you do, you might get a nice reward.\\\\n\\\\n - You may be looking for something in which to carry water.\\\\n\\\\n - Follow the path that leads away from the house.\\\\n\\\\n _ I said \"the path\", not \"the road\"!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get into the cave?\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n - There are two ways.\\\\n\\\\n - The obvious way is to unlock the grate with the keys from the building.\\\\n\\\\n - You will also learn a couple of magic words that will let you teleport\\\\n   in and out from the building.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the wizard\\\\\\'s gate?\\\\n\\\\n - The gate is hinged on both sides.\\\\n\\\\n - First, you have to undo the hinges with some sort of screwdriver.\\\\n\\\\n - A certain treasure would make a good screwdriver.\\\\n\\\\n - I\\\\\\'m lying -- there\\\\\\'s no way past.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\\\\\'s the meaning of the wooden notice?\\\\n\\\\n - I would read it as \\\\\\'To those who come after me: this is the place to\\\\n   ---- the s--\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s not important until much later in the game. I\\\\\\'d better not reveal\\\\n   the answer just yet.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nC. Hall of Mists and Vicinity\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the snake?\\\\n\\\\n - You can\\\\\\'t subdue it yourself.\\\\n\\\\n - You need the help of another being.\\\\n\\\\n - Catch the bird in the cage, then \\\\\\'drop bird\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'free bird\\\\\\' in the \\\\n   Hall of Mt King.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I keep the bird from being frightened?\\\\n\\\\n - Read carefully what the game tells you when you first ask for help.\\\\n\\\\n - The bird is afraid of something about you.\\\\n\\\\n - Did you read the instructions offered to you when you entered the game?\\\\n   It is written: \"Some objects have side-effects; for instance, rods\\\\n   scare birds.\"\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s afraid of your black rod. Drop it before trying to catch the bird.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the dragon?\\\\n\\\\n - Just attack it.\\\\n\\\\n - Yes, with your bare hands.\\\\n\\\\n - Don\\\\\\'t you wish all the monsters were this wimpy?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the Persian rug?\\\\n\\\\n - Roll it up first.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the gold nugget out of the cave?\\\\n\\\\n - You could try throwing it to that passage above the dome.\\\\n\\\\n - But the result is not very convenient.\\\\n\\\\n - Rather than carrying it up the steps, use a magic-word exit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat does the hollow voice mean?\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s saying a magic word.\\\\n\\\\n - The word will teleport you between the Y2 room and the building.\\\\n   This is usually the quickest way to get from the cave to the building\\\\n   and back.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get across the fissure?\\\\n\\\\n - Wave the rod. (Nothing really suggests this specifically, but it\\\\n   stands to reason that magic wands are made for waving.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages, all different?\\\\n\\\\n - The names of the locations are subtly different.\\\\n\\\\n - By making a grid and noting where each direction leads from\\\\n   each location, you can build a map. It\\\\\\'s a hassle, though.\\\\n\\\\n - Actually, you don\\\\\\'t need to go into this maze to finish the game with\\\\n   all the points.\\\\n\\\\n - I haven\\\\\\'t mapped it all out myself. From the west end of long hall,\\\\n   you can go \\\\\\'south, up, up, south\\\\\\' to get to the vending machine.\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'north, down, down, down\\\\\\' should get you back out.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages, all alike?\\\\n\\\\n - This is probably the most famous maze in all of computer gaming. You\\\\n   should feel honored just to be lost in it. \\\\n\\\\n - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.\\\\n\\\\n - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.\\\\n   Then you can make a grid and chart out which directions go from where\\\\n   to where.\\\\n\\\\n - Or you can ask the game to cheat and show you the list of exits from\\\\n   every location, which makes them very much less alike.\\\\n\\\\n - The main thing is to get the pirate\\\\\\'s treasure chest and any treasures\\\\n   he\\\\\\'s stolen from you.\\\\n\\\\n - From the west end of the Hall of Mists, you can go south, east, south,\\\\n   south, south, north, east, east, northwest to get to the chest. Then go\\\\n   southeast, north, down to get out of the maze.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat does the message in the sandstone chamber mean?\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s a favourite quote from technical manuals.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s in Dwarvish. Surely you can read Dwarvish!\\\\n\\\\n - Translate it by moving each letter back one in the alphabet.\\\\n\\\\n - This method works for translating the dwarves\\\\\\' speech, too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the flute from the shadowy figure?\\\\n\\\\n - Is the figure trying to attract your attention?\\\\n\\\\n - Have you seen it in more than one place?\\\\n\\\\n - It seems familiar.\\\\n\\\\n - It looks a lot like you.\\\\n\\\\n - It is you. Go to the mirror canyon for an explanation.\\\\n\\\\n - There is no flute, of course. I made that up.\\\\n\\\\n - But you could try \\\\\\'reflect\\\\\\' and see what happens.\\\\n\\\\n - Reflecting gets you to the other side of the mirror, though it is\\\\n   not at all obvious.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nD. Anteroom and Vicinity\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the magazines for?\\\\n\\\\n - They are traditionally associated with a last lousy point.\\\\n  \\\\n - Leaving them at Witt\\\\\\'s End gives you that point. \\\\n\\\\n - Why at Witt\\\\\\'s End? I haven\\\\\\'t the faintest idea.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get out of Witt\\\\\\'s End?\\\\n\\\\n - If you go west sixty-five times, you\\\\\\'ll get to the anteroom. It \\\\n   always feels longer on the way back.\\\\n\\\\n - Wait -- maybe it\\\\\\'s 165 times.\\\\n\\\\n - Actually, just wander around, going any direction except west.\\\\n   After a few moves, you should get out.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the tusk out of the very low room?\\\\n\\\\n - There\\\\\\'s no way to get it through the slit.\\\\n\\\\n - The only way out is down into the sewer, although you seem to die\\\\n   when you go there.\\\\n\\\\n - Perhaps you should wait till the sewage level drops.\\\\n\\\\n - Actually, if you go back up from the shaft and then down again, you\\\\\\'ll\\\\n   be able to get into the sewers.\\\\n\\\\n - You\\\\\\'ll find anything you lost down the shaft (or in the cellar), plus a\\\\n   spoon.\\\\n\\\\n - Make sure to find your way out before you drown, and before\\\\n   the rats get you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages with streams?\\\\n\\\\n - I must say, I roll my eyes at the solution to this one.\\\\n\\\\n - The game\\\\\\'s hint suggests that you\\\\\\'re somehow offending the dwarves,\\\\n   I guess.\\\\n\\\\n - You\\\\\\'ve just left the sewers. Maybe it\\\\\\'s that nasty smell.\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'wash\\\\\\', then wander up until you get out.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I turn the spoon into a treasure?\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'epns\\\\\\' seems like it ought to be a magic word.\\\\n\\\\n - But it\\\\\\'s not. \\\\n\\\\n - Did you try polishing it?\\\\n\\\\n - I guess the spoon is just worthless.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the rope in the chapel for?\\\\n\\\\n - Climb it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I get out of the giant\\\\\\'s dungeon?\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'lift flagstone\\\\\\', then go south, then climb up.\\\\n\\\\n - Of course, you probably lost some stuff when you got thrown in, and\\\\n   the trick is getting it back.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do in the giant\\\\\\'s living quarters?\\\\n\\\\n - You could bring the food with you. Then he\\\\\\'ll eat it and kick you\\\\n   back out. But that doesn\\\\\\'t get you anywhere.\\\\n\\\\n - What else might the giant enjoy?\\\\n\\\\n - Bring the nest with you. While he\\\\\\'s eating the eggs, you can do what you\\\\n   like. Of course, the nest is a treasure, so you\\\\\\'ll need to get it back\\\\n   somehow. See the troll question for more help.\\\\n\\\\n - The room description doesn\\\\\\'t actually say so, but you can go south, too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the spider?\\\\n\\\\n - Kill it with the sword.\\\\n\\\\n - But surely you don\\\\\\'t have the sword yet.\\\\n\\\\n - You\\\\\\'ll have to engage the help of a nearby friend.\\\\n\\\\n - The owl will eat the spider for you. Summon him with \\\\\\'hoot\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - Your light scares him away. Turn it off first.\\\\n\\\\n - To get the documents, just cut the web with your axe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the mask in the thieves den?\\\\n\\\\n - The game says you can\\\\\\'t. And it tells the truth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the orb from the cellar?\\\\n\\\\n - If you could only get past the portcullis.\\\\n\\\\n - Or the slab.\\\\n\\\\n - Or the drain. Which is it?\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s none of these. The actual solution seems obscure, frankly.\\\\n\\\\n - Get the orb, then drop something else. If it goes down the drain,\\\\n   get it later in the sewer.\\\\n\\\\n - If you drop anything large, e.g. the sword, the wizard kicks it out\\\\n   with you. \\\\n\\\\n - Of course, you may be able to get the orb without going into the\\\\n   cellar.\\\\n\\\\n - A portcullis is not the same thing as a solid door, and the drain\\\\n   has its uses.\\\\n\\\\n - No, you\\\\\\'ll have to work out the rest for yourself. Or go into\\\\n   the cellar, like everybody else does.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat do the images in the orb mean?\\\\n\\\\n - They\\\\\\'re visions of things that will happen as you play the game.\\\\n\\\\n - They can be used as a guide in a particular chain of problems.\\\\n\\\\n - You\\\\\\'ll have to work out for yourself how to know whether the\\\\n   vision you see indicates your next task, or some random future\\\\n   one.\\\\n\\\\n - You don\\\\\\'t need to use the visions, so you don\\\\\\'t need to be told\\\\n   how to do that.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the crypt for?\\\\n\\\\n - That\\\\\\'s where the vampire shows up. I hope you found the crucifix and the\\\\n   holy water.\\\\n\\\\n - To summon the vampire, you need the wizard\\\\\\'s help.\\\\n\\\\n - There are several ways to invoke the wizard\\\\\\'s help. One of them involves\\\\n   the little bird. Read the description carefully.\\\\n\\\\n - Sorry, I\\\\\\'m lying again. The vampire doesn\\\\\\'t move into the crypt until\\\\n   Adventure 770. In this game the crypt is just scenery.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get into the storage room in the tower?\\\\n\\\\n - No way to do that in this version.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the dwarves at the top of the stairs?\\\\n\\\\n - You could attack them from above.\\\\n\\\\n - First you\\\\\\'d need to get on top of the tower from the outside.\\\\n\\\\n - But you can\\\\\\'t. There is no way to get past them. At least not in\\\\n   this version of the game.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is special about the chalice?\\\\n\\\\n - If you fill the chalice and then drink, some strange things happen.\\\\n  \\\\n - But whatever you do, you end up losing the chalice, which is a treasure.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s fun to try, but I don\\\\\\'t think you can help the princess \\\\n   successfully. Just treat the chalice like any other treasure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nE. Bedquilt and Vicinity\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nCan I get around the Bedquilt area more easily?\\\\n\\\\n - In some places, you can type the name of an adjacent room\\\\n   to get to it. That can help avoid the problem of crawling around and\\\\n   winding up back where you started from.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I keep the vase from shattering?\\\\n\\\\n - You need to cushion its fall.\\\\n\\\\n - Before you drop it, drop the pillow from the soft room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get a light source into the room past the emerald?\\\\n\\\\n - If you could carry a light source into the plover room, that would do\\\\n   it. But nothing will fit in from the west. \\\\n\\\\n - Are there any other ways to get to the plover room?\\\\n\\\\n - Yes, actually. Pay attention to the bad pun in the plover room hint.\\\\n\\\\n - \"Why to plover\" means \"Y2, plover\". Typing \\\\\\'plover\\\\\\' in the Y2 room\\\\n   will get you there. \\\\\\'Plover\\\\\\' will get you back too, but you can\\\\\\'t get\\\\n   the emerald out that way. This is not something you could figure out,\\\\n   but you can stumble across the solution by trying to refer to the \\\\n   plover-egg-sized emerald as \"plover\".\\\\n\\\\n - There is actually a way to get a light source into the plover room\\\\n   from the alcove, as the hint suggests.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s something that can be in two places at once.\\\\n\\\\n - But you need to ignite it first.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do with the clam?\\\\n\\\\n - You can pick it up.\\\\n\\\\n - You can open it.\\\\n\\\\n - What would be a good tool for clam prying? Think of sea-related things.\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'open clam\\\\\\' while you\\\\\\'re carrying the trident.\\\\n\\\\n - A pearl rolled out. Go down to the cul-de-sac and get it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the quicksand?\\\\n\\\\n - Create a bridge.\\\\n\\\\n - Read the game\\\\\\'s responses carefully.\\\\n\\\\n - When you wave the rod here, although nothing obvious happens, you\\\\n   temporarily solidify the quicksand. You have to wave the rod again\\\\n   to get back.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I cross the reservoir?\\\\n\\\\n - A full-sized yacht would help.\\\\n\\\\n - Could you magick the \"Ruby Yacht\" (my, what an awful pun!) to grow\\\\n   in size? Or maybe shrink yourself enough to use the yacht?\\\\n\\\\n - No dice. You can\\\\\\'t get across it from the south.\\\\n\\\\n - Read the game\\\\\\'s hint.\\\\n\\\\n - You can get to the north side by going down the whirlpool in the \\\\n   waterfall cavern. Make sure not to take anything but your lamp.\\\\n\\\\n - Hit the gong to summon Darwin, whom you can ride south.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the sword in the stone?\\\\n\\\\n - Like the game\\\\\\'s hint says, you\\\\\\'re just not strong enough.\\\\n\\\\n - Someone with bulging muscles could probably pull it out.\\\\n\\\\n - Eat the mushroom from the dank cave.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I keep from losing objects in the valuation room?\\\\n\\\\n - Don\\\\\\'t drop them there.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nF. The Plant and Beyond\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do with the little plant?\\\\n\\\\n - It seems to want water.\\\\n\\\\n - Bring water in your bottle, then \\\\\\'water plant\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - Do it once more for good measure. Now you can climb up to the hole.\\\\n\\\\n - Maybe you should try watering it a third time?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the rusted door?\\\\n\\\\n - It just needs a little oil.\\\\n\\\\n - Fill your bottle with oil from the east pit in the Twopit room,\\\\n   then \\\\\\'oil door\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the ogre?\\\\n\\\\n - The game\\\\\\'s hint warns against hand-to-hand combat. \\\\n\\\\n - Throw something.\\\\n\\\\n - The axe isn\\\\\\'t good enough.\\\\n\\\\n - Throw the sword. Its name is \\\\\\'Thrower\\\\\\', after all.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs there anything to do in the Sorcerer\\\\\\'s Lair?\\\\n\\\\n - Remember the magic words on the wall.\\\\n\\\\n - You might have seen or will see something that emits blue light.\\\\n   Maybe it is at home here?\\\\n\\\\n - Try dropping the starstone here.\\\\n\\\\n - Yes, the effect can be handy in some special circumstances, but you \\\\n   don\\\\\\'t really need to do this.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the sheets of slime?\\\\n\\\\n - Fight the green slime with something green.\\\\n\\\\n - Throw the vial from the spherical room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get out of the maze of ice tunnels?\\\\n\\\\n - Map the maze. The passages are all either straight, or bend only\\\\n   a little.\\\\n\\\\n - Don\\\\\\'t miss the sculpture.\\\\n\\\\n - Look at your map upside down. It spells a five-letter word.\\\\n\\\\n - Go to the \\\\\\'This way out\\\\\\' room and use that word.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nG. The Troll and Beyond\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get past the troll?\\\\n\\\\n - Throw him a treasure.\\\\n\\\\n - You\\\\\\'ll need one you can reclaim.\\\\n\\\\n - Throw him the nest.\\\\n\\\\n - Remember the words in the Giant room?\\\\n\\\\n - Type them, one after another. You should get the response \\\\\\'Done!\\\\\\' at the\\\\n   end.\\\\n\\\\n - The eggs then return to the Giant room.\\\\n\\\\n - Make sure you don\\\\\\'t reclaim them until you\\\\\\'ve finished with the area\\\\n   past the bridge. Otherwise the troll will take revenge on you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get back across the wooden bridge?\\\\n\\\\n - You need help. Something scary.\\\\n\\\\n - The bear can help.\\\\n\\\\n - Free him, then \\\\\\'get bear\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - Use the keys to unlock the chain.\\\\n\\\\n - Feed the bear first.\\\\n\\\\n - Try to cross the bridge, then \\\\\\'free bear\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs there anything to do in the volcano room?\\\\n\\\\n - Not in the original 350-point version of Adventure.\\\\n\\\\n - Here, yes.\\\\n\\\\n - Make a bridge. You know the routine.\\\\n\\\\n - You need something to protect you from the fumes. How about a\\\\n   mithril ring?\\\\n\\\\n - You can turn the sword into a ring. Use a magic word.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s the word written on the stone you found the sword in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I do at the minotaur statue?\\\\n\\\\n - There\\\\\\'s a hint at a dead end elsewhere in the cave.\\\\n\\\\n - You need to use the proper tool.\\\\n\\\\n - The proper tool can be found in the tool room.\\\\n\\\\n - Not the rags. The proper tool is a magic word.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get away from the gooseberry goblins?\\\\n\\\\n - Are you familiar with the myth of Cadmus?\\\\n\\\\n - I think he sowed something and grew an army of soldiers, although his\\\\n   soldiers ended up fighting each other.\\\\n\\\\n - He sowed dragon\\\\\\'s teeth, as I recall. You can just throw them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get through the fog?\\\\n\\\\n - The game\\\\\\'s hint suggests a question that is answered differently in\\\\n   different places.\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'Do I need to have my lamp on?\\\\\\' is a good question.\\\\n\\\\n - The answer to the question is \\\\\\'Not here\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the pentagram for?\\\\n\\\\n - Use it to imprison summoned beings.\\\\n\\\\n - You can imprison the London Dry Djinn in it.\\\\n\\\\n - Drop the flask here, then open it, then free the Djinn.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I get the starstone after I drop it?\\\\n\\\\n - It has strange spatial properties.\\\\n\\\\n - It\\\\\\'s sort of in two places at once. One location (the one not where you\\\\n   drop it) is where it\\\\\\'s real.\\\\n\\\\n - So when you drop it in the building, it\\\\\\'s not really there. Note that\\\\n   you don\\\\\\'t get points when you drop it there.\\\\n\\\\n - You need to drop it somewhere else outside.\\\\n\\\\n - Remember the wooden notice? The last word was \\\\\\'starstone\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - Luckily, the Djinn will take care of the giant for you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I get back past the basilisk?\\\\n\\\\n - Use the old mirror trick.\\\\n\\\\n - That metal plate ought to do fine.\\\\n\\\\n - But it needs polishing.\\\\n\\\\n - \\\\\\'rub plate\\\\\\' while you\\\\\\'re carrying the rags. Then carry the\\\\n   mirror past the basilisk.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get out of the catacombs?\\\\n\\\\n - They\\\\\\'re hard to map, since they change from game to game.\\\\n\\\\n - It works like this. The first time you go through the catacombs, any\\\\n   sequence of eighteen moves will get you back to \\\\\\'Y2?\\\\\\'. That sequence\\\\n   determines the layout of the catacombs. When you reenter, you have to\\\\n   move the same way, or you end up kind of going backward. If you like,\\\\n   you can play around with dropping objects and see what I mean. I usually\\\\n   just go straight west the first time. Then I reenter, go west eleven or \\\\n   twelve times, then wander around a little until I get to the portal.\\\\n\\\\n - After I leave the area past the portal, I just go straight west until\\\\n   I\\\\\\'m back at \\\\\\'Y2?\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I get the skeleton\\\\\\'s sceptre past the bridge?\\\\n\\\\n - You need to leave it behind and get it later.\\\\n\\\\n - Leave it in the safe. You can also enter the safe from the room with \\\\n   vaulted ceiling.\\\\n\\\\n - How do you open the safe? The game\\\\\\'s hint suggests a skeleton key.\\\\n\\\\n - Use the magic word the skeleton gave you.\\\\n\\\\n - The word changes from game to game.  Make sure you use the right one.\\\\n   (There are four of them, and you\\\\\\'ll need to know all four to finish\\\\n   the game.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I learn all skeleton magic words?\\\\n\\\\n - You don\\\\\\'t need them yet.\\\\n\\\\n - But you will.\\\\n\\\\n - Try wearing the crown.\\\\n\\\\n - Can\\\\\\'t hear anything intelligible? Maybe you should try listening.\\\\n\\\\n - Just make sure you don\\\\\\'t wind up dead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the Djinn\\\\\\'s word for?\\\\n\\\\n - It defeats dwarves. Of course, it also sometimes destroys your\\\\n   weapons and even gets you killed. Make sure you follow the Djinn\\\\\\'s\\\\n   advice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nH. The End Game\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\nThe cave is closing! What should I do?\\\\n\\\\n - You should feel happy, since it means you\\\\\\'ve found all the treasures and\\\\n   are preparing to head to the end game.\\\\n\\\\n - Just wander around until the cave closes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe cave has closed. What\\\\\\'s going on here?\\\\n\\\\n - You need to get out of the repository.\\\\n\\\\n - Breaking the mirror doesn\\\\\\'t work.\\\\n\\\\n - There\\\\\\'s one kind of object here you haven\\\\\\'t seen before.\\\\n\\\\n - The rods with red marks (not stars) are actually dynamite.\\\\n\\\\n - Blow up the northeast area.\\\\n\\\\n - Drop one of the red-mark rods in the northeast area, then go southwest,\\\\n   then \\\\\\'blast\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n - If you could get one of those lamps lit, you could go through the hole.\\\\n\\\\n - There\\\\\\'s no way to light them.\\\\n\\\\n - Just ride the unicorn. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m surrounded by gray mist. What do I do?\\\\n\\\\n - That\\\\\\'s it! You\\\\\\'ve won!\\\\n\\\\n - Not really. You need to magic-word your way out of here.\\\\n\\\\n - There are sixteen magic words in the game. Note that \\\\\\'plover\\\\\\' is a\\\\n   \\\\\\'travel option\\\\\\' -- it is not considered a magic word.\\\\n\\\\n - Just say them in the right order. The game will respond \\\\\\'Ok.\\\\\\' after\\\\n   each one.\\\\n\\\\n - Remember the Djinn\\\\\\'s story about Ralph Witt?\\\\n\\\\n - Ralph Witt liked the idea of reverse alphabetical order.\\\\n\\\\n - Say the words in reverse alphabetical order.\\\\n\\\\n - Still no luck? That\\\\\\'s because the magic word given to you by the\\\\n   skeleton changes from game to game, and you need to know all its\\\\n   possible versions.\\\\n\\\\n - Perhaps you should have worn the crown, which you found in the safe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m back at end of road again. What do I do?\\\\n\\\\n - First, you\\\\\\'ll notice that the locations are connected backward.\\\\n\\\\n - There are other small changes.\\\\n\\\\n - The notice at the view has changed.\\\\n\\\\n - But it doesn\\\\\\'t say anything useful.\\\\n\\\\n - The five-inch slit is now a five-foot slit.\\\\n\\\\n - Go ahead. Go on in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI. Super Spoilers\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nWhat are all the magic words?\\\\n\\\\n - I just can\\\\\\'t bring myself to reveal them here. I think the hints in\\\\n   this file tell you all you need to find them, though. Remember, there\\\\n   are sixteen individual words, and \\\\\\'plover\\\\\\' is not one of them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are all the treasures?\\\\n\\\\n - There are thirty-two treasures in all:\\\\n\\\\n   bag of pieces of eight (beach)\\\\n   crown (safe)\\\\n   nugget (nugget of gold room)\\\\n   diamonds (west side of fissure)\\\\n   silver (N/S passage)\\\\n   jewelry (south side chamber)\\\\n   coins (west side chamber)\\\\n   treasure chest (dead end in maze of passages, all alike)\\\\n   nest of golden eggs (Giant room)\\\\n   trident (cavern with waterfall)\\\\n   helmet (Morion room)\\\\n   vase (Oriental room)\\\\n   emerald (plover room)\\\\n   sceptre (east end of Audience Hall)\\\\n   yacht (southern edge of reservoir)\\\\n   pyramid (Dark room)\\\\n   pearl (cul-de-sac)\\\\n   rug (secret canyon)\\\\n   spices (chamber of boulders)\\\\n   beads (balcony above treasure chamber)\\\\n   chain (barren room)\\\\n   spyglass (south end of Jonah room)\\\\n   sculpture (ice tunnels)\\\\n   bracelet (room with translucent walls)\\\\n   casket of opals (very small chamber)\\\\n   orb (cellar)\\\\n   tusk (bones room)\\\\n   chalice (recess in the beams)\\\\n   sapphire (living quarters)\\\\n   crucifix (thieves den)\\\\n   starstone (narrow basalt shelf)\\\\n   ring (created by player)\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nHow do I get all the points?\\\\n\\\\n - Points are gained as follows:\\\\n\\\\n    20 for getting into a dark area of the cave for the first time\\\\n    10 for getting to beach\\\\n    10 for getting to Sorcerer\\\\\\'s Lair\\\\n    10 for getting to Valley of the Stone Faces\\\\n     8 for freeing Djinn\\\\n    15 for getting to Audience Hall\\\\n     7 for discovering each treasure (224 total -- Note that the tusk is\\\\n       not considered discovered until you drop it in the building.)\\\\n     8 for leaving each treasure in the building (256 total)\\\\n    16 shortly before \\\\\\'cave closing\\\\\\' notice\\\\n    16 for getting \\\\\\'cave closing\\\\\\' notice\\\\n    19 for getting to repository\\\\n    16 for getting to gray mist\\\\n    23 for getting to end of road in the end game\\\\n    16 for winning\\\\n\\\\n   659 total?

Do not use it unless you\\\\nare truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your\\\\nlife.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this\\\\nwill ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even \\\\ncontains some of the ending.\\\\n\\\\nThis is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer\\\\\\'s walkthrough, with \\\\nbetter documentation and some improvements made.  \\\\n\\\\nThese commands will not work in every single game.  There \\\\nare some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work\\\\nfor the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 \\\\npoint, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows\\\\nversion does not conform to this, although the documentation\\\\n*may* be helpful.  \\\\n\\\\nI highly recommend Rick Adams\\\\\\' page:\\\\nhttp://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/\\\\nThis contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an\\\\nFTP site providing source code and compiled versions for \\\\nDOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.\\\\nEven with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due \\\\nto some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to\\\\ncompensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.\\\\n\\\\nFor those reasons, you cannot feed this through input \\\\nredirection, although, if you\\\\\\'re astute enough, you could \\\\nprobably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But\\\\nI doubt anyone would bother.\\\\n\\\\nI can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure\\\\non the Web at Stanford\\\\\\'s machine:\\\\nhttp://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html\\\\nThat is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the\\\\noriginal format that was used, such as five letter packing\\\\nand such that was output from the other machine.  How close\\\\nthis is to the original version, I can\\\\\\'t say.\\\\nI recommend the Web version if you\\\\\\'re running a 14.4 \\\\nconnection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit\\\\noutdated anyway.\\\\n\\\\nEnjoy playing, and I\\\\\\'m sorry I had to do this to you.

It was written\\\\nfor version 1.1. \\\\n\\\\nThis walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is \\\\nnot an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores \\\\nseveral non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions\\\\nto some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant \\\\nchunks, so it\\\\\\'s more-or-less clear why you\\\\\\'re doing what you\\\\\\'re doing. This \\\\nmeans that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it \\\\nshould be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game \\\\nwithout necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section\\\\nI say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from \\\\nbeginning to end will know where to begin from.\\\\n\\\\nNote that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, \\\\nbut others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will \\\\nsay so. \\\\n\\\\nA final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper \\\\nbuilding) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that \\\\nperiod, you won\\\\\\'t be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker\\\\\\'s desk, \\\\nwhich is randomly determined each game. \\\\n\\\\nThe beginning\\\\n-------------\\\\nNE E\\\\nZ Z NO\\\\nSIGN PAPER\\\\nSTAND\\\\nDROP KNAPSACK\\\\n\\\\nThe Powerhouse -

Of course you should read the crumpled note, which basically spells out your predicament--your girlfriend Natalie has apparently left, and you are without your work shirts, which you will need to return to work the following Monday (currently it\\\\\\'s Wednesday), if only to re-establish some sanity or order in your life.  You won\\\\\\'t immediately be able to get down the stairs, because Natalie seems to have returned, to look for her \\\\\\'mojo\\\\\\' (her \\\\\\'lucky charm\\\\\\'), and moved some bookcases to block the bottom of the stairway (it\\\\\\'s a narrow staircase)--you\\\\\\'ll learn this from the sticky note she left on one of the bookcases.  You won\\\\\\'t be able to move them from where you are--you\\\\\\'ll have to get down by some other means.  All you will need from the upper level here is your backpack, your notepad (SEARCH PILE--the one by the bed), and your walking stick (the staff--LOOK UNDER BED).  Make sure you always have these things, though there will be a few times where you\\\\\\'ll  have to put them down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis is a small, two-story apartment--the overhead fan is just over the banister from all locations on this upper level--but at different distances from each location.  It is also your ticket downstairs, but first, you\\\\\\'ll have to turn it off.  The switch is on the fan itself, but you cannot reach it with your hands--you\\\\\\'ll need the staff to turn it off with.  If you look at the fan from different locations, you\\\\\\'ll see (or not) the switch from different angles.  The switch is on the side opposite from the Loft Bedroom--it is in full view from Stairs--but way too distant.  However, in Bedroom Entrance, it is much closer and you see it in profile--an ideal angle from which to HIT FAN SWITCH WITH STAFF.  Now you want to GET ON FAN, but not from Bedroom Entrance, because you also want something sturdy which will break your fall, when the fan detaches, and possibly reduce chance of injury--how about the train-safe refridgerator??  Go to Loft Bedroom and GET ON FAN (JUMP OVER BANISTER will also work, there).   You will now be able to MOVE BOOKCASES from downstairs--if you want.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou can now explore the apartment, if only to find some clue of where to start your mission.  Read the message on the mirror in the bathroom, take the binoculars, in the black case (these will be indispensible) from Natalie\\\\\\'s bedroom. You\\\\\\'ll find the key to her closet stuck in her chair cushions if you SIT IN NATALIE\\\\\\'S CHAIR or SEARCH NATALIE\\\\\\'S CHAIR.  You can look in her closet (SEARCH ART DESK to find the light switch for it), but that won\\\\\\'t be useful until you find all the shirts.  When you leave Natalie\\\\\\'s room, after getting the binocs--Surprise!--you find your office shoes!  Easy points!  Go to the Kitchen and look out the back window--see the odd flash of red?  LOOK AT ODD FLASH WITH BINOCULARS.  Now you have a sense of purpose.  You can go out the front door now, but be sure you\\\\\\'re clear on which building the Red Shirt is on top of.  The building right in front of your back window, the one with the black trampoline on top, is Brockwood\\\\\\'s Men\\\\\\'s Store.  The building that has your shirt on top is the one directly across the street from it going due east--from Brockwood\\\\\\'s and your back window (on the east wall of the apartment).  You just need to remember that it\\\\\\'s across from Brockwood\\\\\\'s.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE RED SHIRT\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- WALTER\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGoing north out the front gate from the parking lot, you go east to Center Street, then go south to get to Brockwood\\\\\\'s.  You are free to do some exploring, but your destination is really the building across the street from Brockwood\\\\\\'s.  It\\\\\\'s the Vacant Building.  You can\\\\\\'t climb up the building from the street; you\\\\\\'ll have to go into the building--the main entrance is barred off--but there is another entrance--go south then east into the Gravel Lot--the entrance is north from here.  You\\\\\\'ll have to find out how to get Walter to let you in.  Ask him some questions--ASK WALTER ABOUT MAGAZINE, ASK WALTER ABOUT HIMSELF, ASK WALTER ABOUT BUILDING, ASK WALTER ABOUT REHAB, ASK WALTER ABOUT LUNCH BOX--you can ask him about other things (even your Red Shirt), but the idea is to gain his trust by showing an interest in him and/or the building.  Then he will make a proposition--get him a \\\\\\'drink\\\\\\' and he will let you in.  He will even tell you how to get the \\\\\\'libation\\\\\\'.  You\\\\\\'ll have to get it from Brockwood\\\\\\'s!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- BROCKWOOD\\\\\\'S\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThen you go into Brockwood\\\\\\'s Store--he will take your backpack--don\\\\\\'t worry, you won\\\\\\'t need it here, and you\\\\\\'ll get it back once you leave.  Go northwest to the Fitting Room.  Look in the mirror there--push the mirror, then voila, you can enter the back room (the locked door in the sales area leads to it, but you can\\\\\\'t use that door).  There is a desk there, with a waste basket next to it.  You\\\\\\'ll need to get into the large drawer, this is where Brockwood hides his booze.  (By the way, I encourage you to look at everything that seems interesting in this game!)  Look in the waste basket for the key.  Read the ledger that\\\\\\'s in the drawer--to feel better about stealing his gin.  For an interesting excursion, try sitting in the swivel chair, and SPIN CHAIR.  You\\\\\\'ll get the key to the hatch in the ceiling, to get on the roof--this will remind you of the trampoline that is there, and the location of the Red Shirt.  Though you don\\\\\\'t really need anything up here.  Now go back down through the Fitting Room and into the store, with the gin bottle--surprisingly, Brockwood will allow you to leave with his bottle--he\\\\\\'s really trying to give it up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- THE BAIT AND SWITCH\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut really, you have no intention of giving a bottle of real gin to an alcoholic.  The game won\\\\\\'t let you!  You\\\\\\'ll have to make Walter \\\\\\'think\\\\\\' that it\\\\\\'s real gin.  From Brockwood\\\\\\'s Front, go south then west to Business Parking, then northwest to Brockwood\\\\\\'s Nook--there\\\\\\'s a water tap there.  POUR OUT the gin bottle, then TURN ON WATER TAP, and FILL BOTTLE WITH TAP.  Don\\\\\\'t worry about opening or closing the bottle, that\\\\\\'s automatic.  Then go back to Walter in Vestibule (SE, E, E, E, N) and give him the bottle.  He\\\\\\'ll assume it\\\\\\'s real because you obviously got it from Brockwood, he won\\\\\\'t ask questions, he\\\\\\'ll leave, giving you his nametag.  You can now enter the building, but there\\\\\\'s one more item you\\\\\\'ll need--go back out to Gravel Lot, go NE, and pick up the lantern there.  Now turn it on and you have light.  Now go through the Vestibule into the Cluttered Passage, you\\\\\\'ll find the roll of duct tape and a newspaper page--which you\\\\\\'ll want to look at (please take all take-able items, they will all fit in the backpack).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- THE SCIENCE LESSON\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs you go into the Auditorium, you\\\\\\'ll notice a hatch way up in the ceiling--it\\\\\\'s open!  If you guessed that your Red Shirt is on the roof beyond this hatch, you\\\\\\'re correct!  You\\\\\\'ll need to figure out how to get up there.  The key is LEVERAGE.  The newspaper page gives some clue--you\\\\\\'re going to put together something that will help you get up there--if only to get your shirt.  Try some things--turn on the spigot, turn it off, turn on the \\\\\\'engine\\\\\\', turn it off--just to get a \\\\\\'feel\\\\\\' of what you\\\\\\'re about to do (Don\\\\\\'t worry, Walter won\\\\\\'t come back until after you \\\\\\'do your thing\\\\\\' here, no matter how long it takes)--already there is what is called an Archimedean Screw, this is your base power source.  Now, go west into the Dim Front--you\\\\\\'ll find a scaffold, examine it--better yet, look at it through the binoculars.  Now PUSH SCAFFOLDING EAST. The scaffolding has a yardstick on top, with a 5-gallon bucket tied to the end, and it\\\\\\'s held down up there by a statue--a precarious balance--try to think of what would throw this balance off?  LEVERAGE.  Fill that bucket, and the statue will topple.  What can fill it--because you cannot reach it--??  The engine.  You\\\\\\'ll need to PUSH SCAFFOLDING TO ENGINE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo, how could the statue toppling be useful to you??  You could PUSH SEESAW TO SCAFFOLDING--but there\\\\\\'s one more thing.  You might not get enough LEVERAGE to vault you through the hatch (and yes, you are going to be on the seesaw). TURN CRANK CW(or CLOCKWISE)--try both directions to get a \\\\\\'feel\\\\\\' for how it works.  What happens?  A bathtub appears, suspended by a chain.  Look at it, better yet with the binocs.  You\\\\\\'ll find that if you turn the crank CW, the bathtub gets nearer to the engine--CC(or COUNTERCLOCKWISE) makes it go the other direction.  You\\\\\\'ll want the tub to be next to the scaffolding, so TURN CRANK CW until the tub almost buts up against the scaffolding.  Let the messages guide you.  Your final addition will be the seesaw--PUSH SEESAW TO STAGE EDGE--you don\\\\\\'t want it to be directly under the tub.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, all you have left to do is put some energy through this system.  And you--the Artist--are going to be the vital fifth element.  Get your stuff together--everything in the backpack, close it up, put it on your back, put the staff through the straps.  You won\\\\\\'t need the lantern beyond this room, so you can drop it here.  Now turn on the spigot, turn on the engine--you have a generous five moves to get on the seesaw.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow let it sing!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf all went well, you are back in Kitchen--having gone through the hatch--but not before seeing Walter charge back in--snatched your Red Shirt, crossed the street (albeit in the air), bounced off of the trampoline and through your own back window.  You\\\\\\'ve come full-circle!  Don\\\\\\'t worry about the police that are now in that Gravel Lot (Walter called them), just avoid it.  You\\\\\\'ll get thrown in jail anyway, which will be part of this journey, but I\\\\\\'d rather you do that part last (but if you want to go ahead and do it, go to the Gravel Lot or the police station and get yourself arrested by either having Walter\\\\\\'s nametag on you or giving the nametag to the sergeant at the station--then skip ahead to BOB AND ROGER, and come back when done).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou can continue exploring, but you won\\\\\\'t be able to get anywhere without interacting with Jerry, the Barber.  So---\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re wondering why he is groping around, you can either look at the pictures on the walls, or in the hallway to the east of his Shop area--or just ASK JERRY ABOUT GLASSES.  He\\\\\\'ll tell you that he tripped on the curb and they fell off and \\\\\\'bounced off somewhere\\\\\\'.  Go to Corner Curb and look in the grating--that\\\\\\'s where the glasses are.  Jerry is a bit self-absorbed, so you\\\\\\'re going to have to figure this one out without his (conscious) help.  Your utility key will not help you open the grating--you\\\\\\'re going to need something sharper or flatter.  You may have noticed the screwdriver in the barber chair..??  Of course, you can\\\\\\'t just take the screwdriver in the presence of its possible owner, so you\\\\\\'ll have to engage in a little subterfuge.  GET IN BARBER CHAIR--you\\\\\\'ll automatically put down your backpack and other stuff.  You\\\\\\'ll be surprised when Jerry pulls out your White Shirt(!), using it as a bib.  You\\\\\\'ll have to play along here, because you won\\\\\\'t be able to just take the shirt just now, Jerry is a bit stubborn.  Let him cut your hair, but while you are on the chair, TAKE SCREWDRIVER.  When he\\\\\\'s finished, you\\\\\\'ll be out of the chair again and you\\\\\\'ll need to give him the $10 bill--declining the $2 change as a courtesy to him (you won\\\\\\'t need it).  Then go to Corner Curb and PRY GRATING WITH SCREWDRIVER.  Then open it and take the glasses.  Play around with them for a while if you want, but they are useless to you--and the world to Jerry.  Give them to him, and you get--a ticket to Bunco Springs Amusement Park(BSAP), down the street.  But not your shirt...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGo east from the shop, into the bathroom, if you haven\\\\\\'t already.  There is a sheet in the hole in the ceiling--you\\\\\\'ll see it when you LOOK UP.  It\\\\\\'s the source of the draft.  You\\\\\\'ll need to get this sheet down.  Neither the sink nor the toilet are sturdy enough to stand on, so you\\\\\\'ll have to get on the shelf--with the towel bar to hold on to.  Take the magazine off of the shelf, then take the towel--you\\\\\\'ll need something to replace the sheet with--then GET ON SHELF.  Now take the sheet and see what it really is.  It\\\\\\'s a barber bib!  Now put the towel in the hole--you will automatically spread the towel over the hole.  Now you can go back into the shop area and give the towel to Jerry.  Now he\\\\\\'s a happy camper!  Plus, seeing his error, he gives you your shirt back!  Now you have your White Shirt.  And you\\\\\\'re ready for the park!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE PARK\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou can do more exploring again, if you want.  If you go to the Demolished Building further south past the park, you\\\\\\'ll see a yellow streamer hanging from the flagpole.  Using the binocs, once again, you discover it\\\\\\'s your Yellow Shirt!  You won\\\\\\'t be able to get it, yet, because you don\\\\\\'t yet have the means to do so, however the sign in front of the building gives you a clue.  Now you should focus on the park, and what you CAN do.  Remember the suggestion about getting your spirits up and perhaps a ride will do the trick...??  Though you are supposed to be \\\\\\'afraid of heights\\\\\\', but now you are so depressed that you don\\\\\\'t care.  Anyway, go in through the Amusement Park Entrance, and give the ticket to Chester in the ticket trailer.  Feel free to get to know Chester and how much of a jerk he is.  You can do some exploring around the park, and even see the demolished building from another angle, at the end of the \\\\\\'nature path\\\\\\'--go into the hole in the tower, go up the stairs--you\\\\\\'ll see the Thinker, and the skylight up top--that\\\\\\'s where the flagpole is rooted.  You won\\\\\\'t be able to open this skylight or remove it, but tuck it away in your memory.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd be careful not to leave the park until after you get results--and you\\\\\\'ll know it when you\\\\\\'ve done it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you tried to get on the roller-coaster, you\\\\\\'ll notice no one is there to start the ride, you won\\\\\\'t be able to start it, so nix the idea for now.  Really, the only other ride is the Wonder Wheel, manned by our friend Rex.  If you\\\\\\'re feeling really sneaky, go to his car in the parking lot and LOOK IN REX\\\\\\'S CAR--you\\\\\\'ll get a white paper bag--there\\\\\\'s some stale popcorn in it so he won\\\\\\'t mind..?? (In fact, if you don\\\\\\'t take the bag, and you do the Wonder Wheel, he\\\\\\'ll leave for lunch in his car, leaving the bag behind.)  Feel free to ask Rex about anyone you\\\\\\'ve met so far, even about important things.  Ask him about the duck, in fact ask him about the popcorn.  Ask Rex about himself.  Now have your binoculars in hand--or wear them--so he can see them--then GET INTO WHITE CAR--he\\\\\\'ll see your binocs and tell you he\\\\\\'ll stop the wheel once you get up top--this is crucial, as it\\\\\\'s an important vantage point, and you\\\\\\'ll get only one chance to do this.  Once he stops the wheel, you\\\\\\'ll notice something--what\\\\\\'s that clinging to the nearer loop on the roller-coaster??  LOOK AT BLUE SPLOTCH WITH BINOCULARS--that\\\\\\'s your Blue Shirt!!  You\\\\\\'ll have 6 moves to do this before the wheel starts up again, and you are back on ground level.  Feel free to use the remaining time to look at other things around you, with the binocs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, you can go to the Kiddie Pond, and give the popcorn to the duck--he gives you a gift.  TAKE ROCK.  Perfect for throwing.  You\\\\\\'ll realize its use when you get on the Crock Blocker!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen you are on the platform for the Blocker, you have six cars to choose from.  This is important--if you get on the wrong car, too far forward, you won\\\\\\'t be able to catch your shirt as it floats by when you are doing the second loop.  In fact, if you get on the yellow car, you\\\\\\'re doomed, because the bar on it is loose--avoid it (devilish grin)--get on the rear car, #6.  Don\\\\\\'t forget to DROP your stuff before getting into the car.  Now when you are in the car, throw the rock at the green lever, and let the ride begin!  You won\\\\\\'t have to type a command, just let the ride do its thing, you\\\\\\'ve made the important choices and now just sit and enjoy.  You\\\\\\'ll catch your Blue Shirt near the end of the ride.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut you won\\\\\\'t be able to rest yet...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHear the ticking noise..??\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSEARCH CONTROL BOOTH.  Now you have an incendiary device in the shape of a pipe.  Time is important here.  Don\\\\\\'t worry about the whats and whys now, you\\\\\\'ll need to put the pipe where it won\\\\\\'t be of any danger to anyone, but perhaps more importantly, where it would be of use to you.  In fact, I encourage you to play around with it, have some fun, try giving it to people, etc etc.  Take advantage of SAVE and RESTORE.  You have 20 moves to get this right.  Think back carefully about where this device might be of use.  Seen any demolished buildings lately??\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd have you been in the tower?  Third floor?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMore crucially, remember your Yellow Shirt?? It\\\\\\'s on the flagpole at the top of the tower.  You\\\\\\'ll need to get this --shall I say, bomb--up there.  You\\\\\\'ll need to somehow attach it to the skylight, so it will work properly--just leaving it in the room won\\\\\\'t be effective enough.  Got the tape?  PUT TAPE ON PIPE.  Now, PUT PIPE ON SKYLIGHT--it will stick.  Now, high-tail it out of there, fast!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBOOOMMM...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, you\\\\\\'ve got 15 moves to do this right....and pay attention to what goes on, particularly after the bomb goes off...if you don\\\\\\'t see these things, you won\\\\\\'t know why you\\\\\\'ll need to do certain things, particularly Chester\\\\\\'s movements, and the hawk that flies over--you\\\\\\'ll see all this if you are back in the park in time to hear the blast from there. Chester will run out of the trailer to get a look, and at the same time, a hawk will fly over, with \\\\\\'something yellow\\\\\\' in its beak.  You\\\\\\'ll see the hawk deposit it on top of the trailer, realizing it to not be food.  Chester meanwhile will run to his car to contact--the police?--on his wireless.  You\\\\\\'ll need to get into the trailer and do 2 things--1) get your shirt from out of the skylight, and 2) develop evidence against Chester, because he\\\\\\'s certainly got a leg up on you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFirst thing\\\\\\'s first--you won\\\\\\'t be able to get into the trailer from the front window.  You\\\\\\'ll have to go to the back of it, via BSAP Parking(go SE from there, or S from Main Exit).  Look under the trailer for the key.  Unlock the door there and you are in.  Your Yellow Shirt is there in the skylight--take it.  Now look at what Chester has left behind--particularly the notebook.  Read it.  Now take it.  Now get out of there, and wait for the police to show up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll figure out that Chester has opportunistically framed you for the explosion--you would have been accused whether you set the bomb or not.  His diary is your proof that he set that bomb, intending for it to go off after the first ride on the Blocker.  With his diary in hand, you\\\\\\'ll be exonerated for this felony, and let go, with your Yellow and Blue Shirts.  But if you have the nametag on you--Walter\\\\\\'s--they will arrest you and put you in jail for the destruction of the other building (unless you\\\\\\'ve already gotten yourself arrested--if so, and you \\\\\\'got results\\\\\\', skip ahead to NAP TIME.  Otherwise, read on).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn the other hand, if you don\\\\\\'t have the diary, the game will end with you being thrown into the Big Clink--not the one at the police station.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE DRUNK TANK\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYep, you\\\\\\'re in the \\\\\\'pokey\\\\\\'.  Walter has got his revenge.  There\\\\\\'s nothing you can do here, essentially, except talk--but you have another 20 moves to do it in.  Get a look at your cell mates.  You\\\\\\'ll find that only one is really sleeping.  Look at the one in the blue jacket.  He\\\\\\'s lying awake.  Look at his jacket.  You may wonder why he is clutching his jacket and shaking.  Is it DTs??  ASK BLUE MAN ABOUT ANXIETY.  He\\\\\\'ll loosen up--then you get a surprise!  Your Green Shirt pops out!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut you won\\\\\\'t be able to get it right away.  It seems to hold some meaning for him.  You\\\\\\'ll need to verbally give him some proof that you should have the shirt.  TELL BLUE MAN ABOUT RED SHIRT(or any other shirt you\\\\\\'ve already gotten--you\\\\\\'ll automatically tell him about Natalie and missing all of the shirts, etc).  How hard was that?  Now you can use the remaining time to get to know Bob and his friend, ask him some questions, about people and things, in the cell, etc.  When the time is up, you\\\\\\'ll all be escorted out of the cell and back into town.  You\\\\\\'ll see Bob and Roger again, in action, so to speak.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou can return to town by going north from here.  If you have all the shirts, read on from here.  If you got only the Green and Red Shirts, go back to JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT.  If you got only the Green, Red and White Shirts, go back to THE PARK.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you have gotten all the shirts, you\\\\\\'ll be prompted to go home and take a nap.  Follow the messages and clues once you get there.  This is where we segue into what is essentially Part II of the game.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNAP TIME\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGo to Natalie\\\\\\'s room and GET ON NATALIE\\\\\\'S BED, because you\\\\\\'ll want to feel closer to her--and, you\\\\\\'ve always wanted to know how comfortable her bed is.  Read all the clues.  When you wake up, you\\\\\\'ll see her diary(!) laying on the bed next to your head.  Don\\\\\\'t worry, it\\\\\\'ll disappear only if you try to take it while off of the bed, or if you take it and then leave the bed--and it will reappear when you get back on the bed.  The only thing you need it for is for a password, and how and where to use it.  So READ DIARY.  You\\\\\\'ll only see the words inside the front cover--pay attention--the \\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\' will be one of five possible words, all beginning with \\\\\\'f\\\\\\'--fooble, forsnook, finsteeth, frotzle or frachet--it was chosen at random at the start of the game, so it can be different if you restart at this point--you will not be able to use one of these words, even if you make the right choice, by chance, without first seeing it in the diary--if you try, you\\\\\\'ll get a snarky response (but try it anyway).  And take her advice--remember to \\\\\\'whisper\\\\\\' it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE SECRET ALCOVE \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhere is the alcove?  It\\\\\\'s not her Nook out in the Living Room.  Remember the closet?  You\\\\\\'ll have to have the light on and go deeper inside it.  Now, WHISPER (the magic word you found in the diary).  Surprise!  Go into that area.  Now look around, do whatever you want, look at the cards, learn about tarot.  Pick up the card on top of the deck.  Look at the cards in the spread.  You don\\\\\\'t have to do these things, but I encourage you to read and explore.  Really, the important thing here is the mojo.  In fact, while you are here, if you listen long enough, Natalie\\\\\\'s voice will spell out your next mission--find her and bring her mojo to her!!  Take the mojo, then step back out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE INVITATION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs soon as you step back into her room, you\\\\\\'ll hear something like an engine running outside, and knock at the door.  Answer it.  YOU got a package, for a change.  But also, the mail has arrived.  Take the black box, and then go check your mailbox.  You\\\\\\'ll have to sift through the junk mail 3 times before finding the important thing--it\\\\\\'s an invite to your boss\\\\\\'s party--TODAY.  And you\\\\\\'ll need to go in your dress shoes--which you haven\\\\\\'t got yet (they\\\\\\'re on the list!).  But you decide that they\\\\\\'ll have to take you in your office shoes, so put them on.  Wonder what\\\\\\'s in the box??  Open it and look into it!  AHH!  Natalie\\\\\\'s been KIDNAPPED.  That is, if you haven\\\\\\'t already figured this out.  You\\\\\\'ll notice some other strange things about this box/sphere.  It seems to tug you in certain directions.  Follow that.  It\\\\\\'ll take you down Lookout Avenue--and while you\\\\\\'re going down there, feel free to explore and look at things.  You\\\\\\'re going to be late, anyway, so take your time.  Examine Mabel Maybre\\\\\\'s--your landlady\\\\\\'s--mansion across the street from you, take a walk down the street, go on the south side.  Look at the end of the street, past your boss\\\\\\'s house--particularly the property with the small house, fenced in.  Now go to the party...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE PARTY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen you arrive, finally, you\\\\\\'ll see most of your co-workers leaving--you don\\\\\\'t need them.  Go up and knock on the door.  If you have your invitation--and the office shoes on--you\\\\\\'ll be grudgingly admitted, don\\\\\\'t worry, this is the only possible way to get in.  Now you can spend all the time you want talking--or trying to talk--to John, Rick, Scottie, look around, etc., but at one point Scottie will be prompted to leave, and John goes upstairs for a nap.  You can spend all the time you want doing whatever you want, but what you should do is first go into the dining room where Richard is, and read the note on the counter.  John found some shoes, and had them thrown to the dog.  Were they yours??  In any case, you feel resentful.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIndulge your curiosity.  When John went upstairs, he left the rope detached.  So go on up!  Don\\\\\\'t worry, his wife cannot stay in one place very long, she won\\\\\\'t catch you or notice you.  Follow the snoring.  Now you\\\\\\'re in John\\\\\\'s room.  Stay quiet.  Look in the closet--gotcha!  Look at things.  You\\\\\\'ll need to take two things--really three--the key from the drawer in the nightstand, and John\\\\\\'s shoes.  Yep, John\\\\\\'s shoes.  Be quiet about it!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow go back down and onto the patio.  What do we do with the shoes??  Remember the note on the counter??  Now do unto John as he has done unto whoever those shoes belonged to.  Could be you, maybe not.  But be careful not to throw them directly at Ruffy.  You see, the sphere is pulling towards the doghouse, and you want to go in there without Ruffy knowing.  So you want to distract him a little.  Is there a tree, or a fence, in the other direction??  THROW JOHN\\\\\\'S SHOES AT TREE, or THROW JOHN\\\\\\'S SHOES OVER SHORT FENCE.  He\\\\\\'ll get right after them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow the party\\\\\\'s over for you, you must now go into the doghouse--you can look around there if you want, but you have 5 moves to unlock the gate with the key you found in John\\\\\\'s room--or face Ruffy.  Look at the \\\\\\'mass\\\\\\' you find there--take it for the points.  Now go--go south, then take the curious object you find on the ground nearby.  You\\\\\\'re now at the vacant property next door--if you explored around the Raditch House before you came to the party, you\\\\\\'ll realize that this is the house that was fenced in.  The sphere tugs you strongly in this direction, then breaks from your grasp and busts against the cellar doors outside the house, as you approach.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nObviously, you should go down in there...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNATALIE...??\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou find Natalie tied into a chair in this cellar.  But not too tightly, as you find out, if you try to cut her bonds--with the strange \\\\\\'handle\\\\\\'--which is a switchblade (aren\\\\\\'t they illegal now?).  You can take the bandanna out of her mouth, and then UNTIE NATALIE.  You\\\\\\'ll find out that she\\\\\\'s not too conversational--time is of the essence.  What was your mission?  To give her the mojo.  So do it!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut you just can\\\\\\'t....\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou can try.  In fact, you can try three times.  Or not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEither way, about 15 or so moves after you free her, you\\\\\\'ll find out that she\\\\\\'s really...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMABEL!  Your landlady!  And she becomes a giant bird!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd that the small house and cellar were just a mirage!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBefore you have any time to think, Mabel flies up and takes you with her.  Why couldn\\\\\\'t she just take the mojo??  Because it would reject her grasp.  But there\\\\\\'s something about that she NEEDS, and it needs to be willingly given to her by its owner--which is the REAL Natalie.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLOCKED UP, AGAIN?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou wake up in a jail cell, tied--this time much more tightly--to a chair, bolted to the floor.  In a dark, mildewy jail cell underground.  You cannot do anything, you cannot get up.  But wait, what is that in your back pocket (assuming that you did pick up that strange \\\\\\'handle\\\\\\' back at the vacant property?)??  Push the little button on the handle in the back pocket--it\\\\\\'s a switchblade!  Cut the ropes with it.  Now you can get up--to find out that the cell door isn\\\\\\'t locked.  You can now leave the cell and go west into the main area--but also collect all of your things from the dungeon alcove just beyond the cell.  Don\\\\\\'t worry, all Mabel is interested in is the mojo, which you are still wearing because she cannot take it off of you.  Is this a dungeon, or is it a gym??  Because you see all this exercise equipment laying around.  You\\\\\\'ll find out for sure about 15 moves from the time you entered the Exercise Room before Mabel comes down to toture you--and the game ends. Try some of it out, if you want, but what you want to do is open the \\\\\\'steam bath\\\\\\' and pick up the alabaster key from the floor inside it.  You\\\\\\'ll need it later.  If you want some laughs, SAVE your position, and try some of the other equipment!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow what you have left to do, here, is leave through the hatch overhead.  Now you are at Base of Mountain--pick up the plastic stick that you find there, it\\\\\\'s a phosphorescent light stick--BREAK STICK for a light source.  You\\\\\\'ll need to go east over to the oak tree fast--you have 5 moves from the time you emerged from the hatch before Mabel spots you.  Once you get to the tree, you won\\\\\\'t have to worry about Mabel again--for now.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNIGHTSCAPE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow from Tree Base, the only way you can go is UP.  You can wear the light stick on your wrist, and put everything you have in your backpack, wear it, and then WEAR STAFF (in case you haven\\\\\\'t yet found out, the staff can be slid through the straps and worn in this way).  Now go UP the tree.  You are immediately presented with three branches going in northerly directions--north, northeast and northwest.  Which one is correct??  You can try them if you want.  But look around.  There is a hollow behind you--look into it!  There, you find a leather whip!  Read the tag--\\\\\\'From the One That Got Away\\\\\\'.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso, there\\\\\\'s another branch--overhead.  SWING WHIP AT STRONG BRANCH.  Then SWING ON WHIP.  Bombs away!!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYour way from here is pretty well cut and dried--you\\\\\\'re on the other side of the fence, so you can follow the path around the mountain, and then into the cave--which is a tunnel that goes into the heart of the mountian.  Now go into the door--after picking up the piece of paper lying there.  Now you are in a strange place...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBLACK AND WHITE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis is just an abstract piece of interactive fiction that I decided to write into the game...\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow you are in the center of a perfectly white room with a huge black dot--there is even a sign indicating where you are!  If that\\\\\\'s not enough, the piece of paper you have also has a huge black dot--this is a map, of sorts, showing you where you are.  Again, you can walk around, examine, explore all you want.  Use the white key that you got from the exercise room to unlock the white door, go into the room with the desk and examine the huge book that you find there--it\\\\\\'s a ponderous tome written by Rene Decartes.  What is perhaps his most famous saying?  \\\\\\'I think, therefore I am\\\\\\'.  So we come to the one thing you need to do here.  Think.  But you need to do this in the right place.  Go where you feel most \\\\\\'centered\\\\\\'--on The Dot.  Now--guess.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHINK.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nON THE MOUNTAIN\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow you are on the terrace near the top of North Mountain.  Don\\\\\\'t worry about getting off the mountain or back where you were.  And don\\\\\\'t worry--yet--about Mabel.  Examine the fire--what\\\\\\'s in it?  You have about 5-7 moves to take your nametag from the flames.  That\\\\\\'s the last thing on your list!  You get the points.  Put the nametag on, because it\\\\\\'s an important identity symbol.  Now you can look around and examine things there on the terrace.  Specifically, examine the hole on the side--what do you notice just over the side, near the hole?  A cave entrance, on a lower level.  You\\\\\\'ll need to get down there.  How?  It\\\\\\'s a precarious climb, and there are no hand-holds.  Seven symbols of your identity will be needed to help you climb down there.  You\\\\\\'re already wearing one--the nametag--as a sort of bolster to your courage.  Now, what do you have that can fit into the hole?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYour staff.  PUT STAFF IN HOLE.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow, you\\\\\\'re going to have to make a rope--with the remaining five things.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe shirts.  It doesn\\\\\\'t matter what order you tie them in, you can do it this way--TIE RED SHIRT TO WHITE SHIRT.  TIE BLUE SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE YELLOW SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE GREEN SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  Or however.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow you have a long rope.  Obivously, you can TIE ROPE TO STAFF.  Voila!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRemember to be wearing your nametag before you go.  Now, DOWN....\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou are now in front of the cave entrance, on a narrow ledge.  The only way to go is into the entrance, south.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou find--NATALIE!--but she\\\\\\'s lying down with her hands tied.  She notices you--listen to her--she IS the real Natalie.  Cut her bonds with the switchblade--you won\\\\\\'t be able to untie the leather string.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnother surprise!  (And don\\\\\\'t worry, you did everything correctly up to here.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow you have TWO Natalies!  Is this a good thing??  No, because one of them is Mabel!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow ask either one of them anything!  Try anything!  Have fun!  You won\\\\\\'t be able to tell which one is which, no matter what you do or ask--but listen to what they say.  The crucial thing is knowing which one to give the mojo to.  After about 20 moves from the time you freed the real Natalie, one of them will say something interesting.  Remember the \\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\' from earlier?  She will say that word, to which the other will say \\\\\\'Oh bullhockey, honey, don\\\\\\'t listen to her!  She\\\\\\'s nuts!\\\\\\'  Which ever one, the Natalie on the left, or the Natalie on the right, that said the \\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\' is the one that you should give the mojo to!  (Like the magic word, which Natalie is the correct one is not necessarily the same in each complete game playing.)  Now watch the pyrotechnics!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGETTING HOME\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNatalie has now flown you both back down to the ground, but beyond that point, she is not exactly going to hold your hand on the way home.  Really there is only one route you can go--she will not let you turn back.  Listen to her as you pass the Goblins, Inc. shop--an important suggestion.  You are now on Center Street--but now it\\\\\\'s night time and you are heading south to the corner at Rex\\\\\\'s--you\\\\\\'ve been here before, but just during the day when it wasn\\\\\\'t so active.  Now turn west--you are now at the Alley Entrance, again.  You see two pairs of feet sticking out of the alley--EXAMINE FEET, for another surprise!  It\\\\\\'s your two buddies from the jail cell!  Natalie looks none too patient, but she\\\\\\'ll need to wait for a bit, because this is a very important encounter--a key conversation.  You have 20 moves to tell them about the right things.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey want to know how your quest is going.  Now TELL BOB ABOUT one of the following--Natalie, Mabel, the kidnapping, the shirts, the rescue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBob will then \\\\\\'confer with his cohort\\\\\\' and in moments, this results in him donating their jackets to you and Natalie.  You get Bob\\\\\\'s jacket, because, with your bald pate, you look more like him, and Natalie gets Roger\\\\\\'s jacket--and she gets the fedora--with her hanging on your neck, this makes you two look like the two of them, with Bob toting Roger to their lodgings for the night, at the apartments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow all you have to do is get home.  Literally.  Continue west to Lookout Avenue Apartments, go south into the gate, and go back to the apartment.  Your disguise fools the giant bird hovering around the mountain to the north, until the hat blows off of Natalie--just as you get inside the gate.  Then Mabel spots her and as the two of you start running, the gate begins to close.  Crazy Mabel doesn\\\\\\'t notice this, as intent as she is, and just as she swoops down, the gate closes!  Game over for her!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd for you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThank you for playing my game, and as the ending says, look out for \\\\\\'Bullhockey 2!\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'This is a walkthrough for Cold As Death, by Gorm. \\\\n\\\\nAt the time of the walkthrough creation, this game could be played at\\\\nhttp://www.lai.as/games/ColdAsDeath/ .\\\\n\\\\nSince actions are timed, you have 20 seconds between run or jump\\\\nactions; if you don\\\\\\'t take one of these actions every 20 seconds, you\\\\\\'ll\\\\nfreeze to death.

Daar kun je een briefje \\\\noppakken. In het briefje staat hoe je de commando\\\\\\'s in kunt \\\\ntypen. Als je door het raam klimt, zul je de schep vinden. Als \\\\nje naar je slaapkamer gaat, zul je een kleine, brandende \\\\nlantaren vinden. Het is ook mogelijk om een tukje in je bed te \\\\ndoen. Verder is hier nu nog niets te doen, dus ga weer terug \\\\nnaar de kamer. In het oosten is een hal, waar een sneetje \\\\nbrood, een fles melk en een munt liggen. Ook staat er een \\\\nmooie houten kist. Als je de kist beter bekijkt, zul je een \\\\nvreemde inscriptie ontdekken. Misschien is het handig als je \\\\ndie inscriptie even opschrijft. Misschien ook niet.\\\\n\\\\nNu kun je je huis verlaten en naar buiten gaan. Je staat dan \\\\nmidden in het dorp, en je ziet de herberg en in de verte een \\\\ngroot, eng kasteel. Ga de herberg binnen. Ga zitten en luister. \\\\nJe zult een aantal gasten horen praten. Luister dan nog een \\\\nkeer en de gasten zullen opstaan en ergens anders gaan zitten. \\\\nAls je weer bent gaan staan, wil je natuurlijk de knoflook \\\\nhebben. Maar je mag het niet pakken van de waard! De oplossing \\\\nis dat je intypt \"koop knoflook\". Dan zal de waard het gewoon \\\\naan je geven. Typ dan \"vraag waard\" en hij zal je een trap \\\\nnaar de zolder laten zien. Ga naar de zolder. Daar tref je een \\\\nkist aan die onder het stof zit. Blaas het stof weg, en er \\\\nkomt een oud boek te voorschijn. In dit boek staat hoe je \\\\nvampiers kunt doden. Bekijk de rare steen ook eens goed... Je \\\\nkunt ook het bloed op de grond onderzoeken, maar daar wordt je \\\\nniet veel wijzer van. Ga weer naar beneden in de herberg. Als \\\\nje in een agressieve bui bent, kun je de waard in elkaar \\\\nslaan, maar na een paar keer zal hij je doden en moet je \\\\nopnieuw beginnen. Daarom is het handig als je het spel even \\\\nopslaat voordat je hem gaat slaan. Dit doe je door \\\\\\'bewaar \\\\nspel\\\\\\' in te tikken. In de herberg is nu voorlopig niets meer \\\\nte doen, dus we gaan naar het bos.\\\\n\\\\nAls je weer buiten staat, ga dan het bos in. Nu moet je even \\\\nronddwalen (ga west, ga noord etc.) tot je bij een boomhut \\\\nkomt. Hier kun je de voetafdrukken bekijken, en dan in de boom \\\\nklimmen. In de hut zul je een kapmes en een houten wig vinden. \\\\nGa weer omlaag, en probeer voor de grap eens in de boom te \\\\nsnijden.\\\\n\\\\nGa dan het bos weer uit door weer op goed geluk allerlei \\\\nrichtingen op te lopen. Nu gaan we maar eens een kijkje nemen \\\\nin het kasteel!!\\\\n\\\\nAls je het bos weer uit bent, ga dan naar het noorden en naar \\\\nhet kasteel. Als je een andere richting neemt, kom je weer in \\\\nhet bos. Als je voor het kasteel staat, kun je de tekst boven \\\\nde ingang lezen en dan naar binnen gaan. Binnen zul je een \\\\nharnas aantreffen. Als je erin wilt kruipen, moet je \"trek \\\\nharnas\" intypen. Als je daarna \"kijk vizier\" typt, zul je \\\\nvreemde dingen zien. Trek het harnas dan weer uit, want je \\\\nkunt er nu nog niet mee bewegen. Je kunt het wel meenemen, \\\\nmaar laten staan voor later is ook goed. Je kunt namelijk \\\\nmaar een beperkt aantal spullen meedragen. Je moet dus goed \\\\nopletten waar je dingen laat, zodat je ze later weer kunt \\\\nophalen als je ze nodig hebt. \\\\n\\\\nEr is hier een deur, maar als je daar door loopt, kom je in \\\\neen kamer waar verder niets is te doen. Er is hier alleen \\\\neen lange tafel met etensresten. Ga de kamer uit, en loop de \\\\ntrap op. Je staat voor slaapkamer 2, maar de deur is niet \\\\nopen te krijgen. Als je naar het westen gaat, kom je bij \\\\nslaapkamer 1. Als je die ingaat, kun je naar een balkon. Als \\\\nje daar van af springt, ben je dood. Ga slaapkamer 1 weer \\\\nuit, en loop weer naar het oosten. Je bent dan weer bij \\\\nslaapkamer 2. Ga nu de nauwe gang zuidwaarts in. Je kunt \\\\nhier verschillende kanten op. Als je de wenteltrap omhoog \\\\ngaat, kom je in de kasteeltoren. Hier is een kist met een \\\\ngesloten luik. Nu kun je die nog niet openen. Ga door het \\\\nraam en je zult een waterbron in de verte zien. Vanaf nu kun \\\\nje bij die waterbron komen in het bos. Ga weer omlaag en dan \\\\nnog een keer omlaag. Je staat nu voor een geheimzinnige deur, \\\\nwaarop gebonkt wordt. Ook deze deur kun je nu nog niet \\\\nopenen. Als je weer omlaag gaat, kom je op de begraafplaats. \\\\nAls het goed is, is hier een lange ladder. Neem die mee. Je \\\\nkunt eventueel nog door het poortje gaan, om bij de graven \\\\nte kijken. Ga weer door het poortje en ga omhoog. Ga nogmaals \\\\nomhoog en zet dan de ladder neer, die zal tot het gat reiken. \\\\nKlim de ladder op en je bent in de spionageruimte. Ga naar \\\\nhet oosten. Je kunt nog verder naar het oosten, maar daar \\\\nloopt de gang dood. Ga terug en ga door het gat omlaag. Je \\\\nkomt in een ventilatieruimte, waar je verder niets kunt doen. \\\\nGa weer omhoog en twee keer naar het westen. Ga dan omhoog de \\\\nuitgehouwen trap op en kijk door het gat. Je zult Dracula \\\\nzien die in een kist stapt. Als je nog een keer kijkt zie je \\\\neen dichte kist staan. Klaarblijkelijk zit Dracula daar in, \\\\nmaar vergis je niet. Als je weer naar beneden gaat via de \\\\nladder zul je hem tegenkomen. Je kunt proberen hem te slaan, \\\\nschoppen of doden, maar dat haalt niets uit. Hij zal je \\\\naltijd doodbijten. Nee, de truc is dit: typ \"schijn dracula\", \\\\nen gooi dan de knoflook. Dracula zal met een plof verdwijnen, \\\\nmaar hij is nog niet dood!\\\\n\\\\nNeem de ladder mee en ga nu het kasteel weer uit, - let op! \\\\nDe deur valt nu dicht en kan niet meer open!- en ga naar het \\\\ndorp. Je kunt nu naar de waterbron. Gooi de duivelaarsmunt \\\\nin de waterbron, en vul de fles met het giftige, blauwe \\\\nwater dat nu is ontstaan. Je kunt de munt ook weer meenemen \\\\nals je dat wilt. Als je behoefte hebt om nogmaals op de \\\\nzolder van de herberg te kijken, dan kan dat. Maar de waard \\\\nzal je er niet langs laten. Als je hem de munt geeft, wordt \\\\nhij weer wat rustiger en kun je op zolder kijken. Hier is \\\\nechter nog steeds niets te vinden. Ga weer naar je eigen \\\\nhuis en naar de slaapkamer. Als je nu gaat slapen, zul je \\\\nmidden in de nacht wakker worden door gebonk onder je bed. \\\\nSchijn met de lamp onder je bed en je ziet een open luik \\\\nzitten. Ga omlaag door het luik. Je zult een doosje en een \\\\nbijl aantreffen. Open het doosje en je vind een hamer. Pak \\\\nde bijl en ga weer omhoog. Ga naar het bos en zoek weer naar \\\\nde boomhut. Hak nu met de bijl een stuk hout uit de boom, \\\\nen raap dat op. Snij nu met het mes in het hout en het zal \\\\nde vorm van een kruis krijgen. Je kunt voor de lol met de \\\\nbijl ook huis gaan houden in de herberg. Als je de bijl \\\\ngooit zal de waard hem weer terug smijten enz.\\\\n\\\\nGa weer naar je huis en zet de ladder neer onder het gat \\\\nboven je. Beklim de ladder en pak het touw dat daar ligt. \\\\nGa weer omlaag, neem de ladder mee en ga naar je slaapkamer. \\\\nKruip weer door het luik onder je bed. Pak de hamer en \\\\ngraaf met de schep naar het noorden tot je op iets hards \\\\nstoot. (De bijl heb je overigens niet meer nodig, evenals \\\\nhet mes, de lamp en de knoflook. Zorg dat je in ieder geval \\\\nde hamer en de wig hebt, het touw en de fles met giftig \\\\nwater.) Duw  de steen weg en ga door het ontstane gat. Je \\\\nbent nu weer in het kasteel en je stuit op de doodskist van \\\\nDracula. Open de kist en de klok zal twaalf uur slaan door \\\\nje pc speaker. Dracula opent de ogen en zal wegvluchten. \\\\nTyp nu telkens \"volg dracula\", totdat hij niet verder gaat \\\\nen hij voor je komt staan. Tijdens je achtervolging zul je \\\\nmerken dat je nu wel door het luik kunt gaan van de kist, \\\\ndie eerst dicht zat. Je komt dan in slaapkamer 2 waar je \\\\neerst niet in kon. Maar goed, Dracula staat op het punt je \\\\nweer aan te vallen. Als je de knoflook en de lamp nu zou \\\\ngebruiken haalt het niets meer uit. Nee, nu moet je het \\\\nhouten kruis tonen. Dracula zal angstig tegen de muur \\\\nopkruipen en de handen voor zijn ogen slaan. Sla dan de wig \\\\nmet de hamer door zijn hart en Dracula is dood!!!! Zijn \\\\nlijk zal tot stof vervallen en je kunt nog net het woord \\\\n\\\\\\'incoronium\\\\\\' lezen. Vergeet ook niet om de gouden halsband \\\\nop te rapen die hier ergens ligt.\\\\n\\\\nGa nu naar de kamer waar stond \"Dit is Sesam\". Typ nu de \\\\ntoverspreuk in die het lijk van Dracula achterliet en de \\\\ndeur zal opengaan. Je komt nu oog in oog te staan met een \\\\ngevaarlijke spin. Ook hier kun je proberen haar te doden maar \\\\ndat lukt niet. Je moet de fles met giftig water kapot gooien. \\\\nDe spin zal dan het water opdrinken en sterven. Als je \\\\nrondkijkt, zie je een vuur in deze kamer. Als je er doorheen \\\\nloopt, ga je dood. Je zult het harnas aan moeten trekken. \\\\n(Als je het niet bij je hebt, moet je het gaan halen) Je zult \\\\nmerken dat je je nu opeens wel kunt bewegen in het harnas. \\\\nLoop door het vuur heen en je komt in de geheime schatkamer. \\\\nHier staat een kist vol met gouden munten. Als je de kist \\\\noppakt zal het kasteel gaan schudden en beven. Het wordt tijd \\\\ndat je je uit de voeten gaat maken.\\\\n\\\\nAls je weer terug bent gegaan door het vuur, moet je naar de \\\\nplek waar de doodskist van Dracula stond. Gooi alle voorwerpen \\\\ndie je bij je hebt weg, en pak de doodskist op. Ga nu naar \\\\nslaapkamer 1 en naar het balkon. Knoop daar het touw vast, ga \\\\nomlaag via het touw en zet de doodskist neer. Kruip nu in de \\\\ndoodskist en je zal met kist en al van de heuvel afglijden, zo \\\\nhet dorp in. Als je weer uit de kist bent gestapt heb je het \\\\nspel uitgespeeld. Je kunt nu gaan genieten van al je geld. \\\\nHoewel. Er lopen nog meer mannen rond in lange, zwarte \\\\njassen...\\\\n\\\\nNB: Het is mogelijk bepaalde handelingen in een andere volgorde \\\\nte doen, en voorwerpen op andere plaatsen te laten etc.\\\\n\\\\nGeschreven door John Stigter aka Dj Dimwit.

You are to\\\\nescape the castle. There are three missions you might also want to do to\\\\ncomplete the wholestory of this beautiful text adventure game.\\\\n\\\\nWalkthrough:\\\\nEast: One of the torch is not firmly attached. Get it. This would be your\\\\n      only light source\\\\nWest: Great Hall. There is a magic word written here. Some other areas\\\\n      would bring you back to here whenever this magic word is spoken.\\\\n      There are also other magic words. To distinguish it, we would refer\\\\n      this as return magic word.\\\\nUp,Up: There is a painting here.\\\\n      Try to get it. Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west\\\\nWest: Prison cell\\\\n      There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them\\\\n      appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.\\\\n      You are trapped. But don\\\\\\'t worry, you have the return magic word.\\\\n      so... You are back to Great Hall\\\\n\\\\nTry to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,\\\\nand east where you can light it again. If you come to a place where there\\\\nis a sign \"Abandon Ye...\" on the west door then north, south, and west would\\\\nallow you to pass the west door. If you are ready then:\\\\n1. Passing the Bengal tiger\\\\n   Go to music room, get oboe, go to wine-cellar room, wash oboe, back to\\\\n   menagerie, play oboe. You put him on sleep\\\\n2.

So there are actually\\\\n   three doors. Go to south east to torture chamber. Get secateur. Go to\\\\n   green house. Cut vines\\\\n3. Passing the dragon\\\\n   From green house, north, east, enter crypt. There is a candle here. If\\\\n   your torch is unlighted, light it. Now, the southern wall has three doors.\\\\n   Choose the one which appears to be safe (remember). Don\\\\\\'t forget to\\\\n   adjust the orientation. Inside, there is an armor. Get it.\\\\n   There is also a magic word to save your game here.\\\\n   Return to Great Hall. Go to rotunda, southwest, south. See the candles?\\\\n   Blow them. The fireplace to the west open.

You are\\\\n   transported to other room.\\\\n5. Looking for keys?\\\\n   Go to gazebo, get ladder. Transport to the other part of castle. Go to\\\\n   cruciform, north. Drop ladder, climb up ladder and you would find a\\\\n   statue there. Get statue but don\\\\\\'t break it. Down, south, and west.\\\\n   You are standing on balcony above the terrace. Throw statue. Smash!\\\\n   Return to Great Hall, Go to terrace. Get a set of keys.\\\\n6. Passing basilisk\\\\n   Go to lord bedroom. Open closet. Now, a basilisk is hiding there.\\\\n   Run, You would be safe if you don\\\\\\'t run to the room where you come in or\\\\n   you don\\\\\\'t run to a dead end. To get rid of it, from lord bedroom, north,\\\\n   north (cruciform), east. There is a magic word that whenever is spoken\\\\n   somewhere else, everything there would be disappeared. So south, and say\\\\n   the magic word.\\\\n7. Fetching the Star of diamond\\\\n   Bring the set of keys with you. Go to lord chamber, south, down until\\\\n   you come to the nursery room, west. Notice the furnace? unlock it,\\\\n   open it, and you can get the Star\\\\n8. Exploring rooms behind hall of dragon\\\\n   Go to catacomb east of it. Southeast. Northeast. Keep trying to go to\\\\n   northeast until you found a bridge. Cross it. You would find a chained\\\\n   troll. If you have the keys with you, unlock it. He would steal the\\\\n   keys from you. Unless you have had the star of diamond, you won\\\\\\'t need\\\\n   them anymore. East, north, west on the edge of a pit. Down. You entered\\\\n   a Zimbu house (This one too is just like the basilisk will be after you).\\\\n   So grab the book fast.

You don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t remember this girl, but you both have obvious chemistry.\\\\nYou can say anything you like to Clara, but I prefer to leave \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x98You dealing?\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d out of the conversation. She\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s a bit hurt that you can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t remember her, but knows you clearly like her anyway. Normally you pass out for a short time.\\\\nT CLARA\\\\nT PORN when he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s finished telling an irritating bugger named Glavine off, to go through all ways of earning an income in a city like New Haz.\\\\nWhen Johnny Dapper arrives and announces his bounty on your head, talk to Porn or Clara immediately. No time for questions, focus on getting out of there. Clara will give you her house keys and distract Dapper.\\\\nE to leave Sunrise Sushi.\\\\nGo North until you read \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x98To the east is a small townhouse complex\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99. This is Clara\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s house.\\\\nE\\\\nYou can look around the place and wait until you hear an awful noise from the intercom.\\\\nPress blue button to let Clara in.\\\\nT Clara: 1 is a good option.\\\\nZ (Clara is off to have a shower)\\\\nZ\\\\nT Clara\\\\nBe a gentleman. When it comes to sleeping arrangements, volunteer to sleep on the beanbag. So, 2 is best.\\\\nYou get rewarded by Clara waking you up later. \\\\nKiss her. You can do so again, the dialogue continues. When it stops, make love to Clara.\\\\nWhen you both wake up, why not to talk her about the painting?\\\\nSoon enough, two thugs will arrive and give you 24 hours to pay back another debt, not related to Dapper at all. You can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t attack them, you can only TALK TO LARGE THUG as he shoots his partner to make a point. How rude, Clara\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s door and carpet are ruined.\\\\nNo matter what you say, he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s only there to warn you so you won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t be attacked. You\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll wait for Porn to arrive and Clara to get ready. I don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t know which verb makes you help Porn in trying to put the wrecked door back on the hinges, sadly.\\\\nGoing North, North, East to Pizza Zoo is only for you to eat a slice, hear Clara and Porn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s ideas for how to get started in making money and ask Porn what an upper-decker is if you really want to know. He\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s a good friend, is Porn, but he has no taste.\\\\nWe\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll be stopping off at your place (Boggit Street, at the very top near the Copbot) and Porn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s apartment (the apartment on Main Street). I tried going to Porn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s place to pick up the honey jar before going to the pizza shop, but there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s no use. Pick up your backpack and credit card, as that\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s where your earnings will be transferred.\\\\nIf you like you can go to the CopBot at the end of the road near Coffman, and E and N to Kim Street for the weapons store if you haven\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t played before. You will soon know you need a weapon to enter the rest of New Haz and the price of the three guns available from the cheery people at the weapons store.\\\\nGo down Boggit Street, Rygarr Avenue and Main Street to Academy Videos. Your friend Tericho is there, fuming about being ripped off by a rude guy named Adrian Bates inside.\\\\nThis is a long slog with a random generation of bargain games. Save before you go in, you may get on a loop of the same wonderful game and this will make progressing impossible.\\\\nPUT ALL IN BACKPACK\\\\nTAKE GAMES to as much as you can hold.\\\\nX each game name will give Yar\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s accurate review of it so you know which ones to GIVE TO CLERK so he can snigger himself to death.\\\\nThese are some of the bad ones that will make the uppity twerp eventually laugh himself into unconsciousness: Batman, Outpost, Night Trap, Reloaded, Tekwar, Tetris (relatively), Trespasser, Shadows of Cairn, Custer\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Revenge, E.T., Dominion, Madden \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9997, Saied, Fork in the Tale, Sinister Six, World War II : On-Line, Crime Wave, Force Commander.\\\\nTo make things easier, put the good games in your backpack so you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re less likely to pick them up again from the bargain bin. They have no further use- selling is not an option as the pawn shop doesn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t have staff, and you won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t be able to play them. Drop them if you like after Bates is sprawled on the ground.\\\\nTake Adrian Bates\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99 card and give it to Porn get the register money transferred to your card. You can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t give Tericho the money he was owed, but he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s satisfied with your revenge.\\\\nNow, we have our money. Let\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s go and get the electric pistol- the only weapon we can afford right now. Getting more deadly weapons is optional, but would probably make combat easier. Truth be told, only the electric pistol can be reloaded at the Ammobot, so no playing with bullets as you only get five. X PISTOL to get an idea if you need it reloaded.\\\\n\\\\nMAKING MONEY IN NEW HAZ MADE EASY\\\\nGo to see Trotskie on Coffman Avenue. He\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s running a D&D game with your other friends that Porn will rudely interrupt, but he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll tell you that the morgue needs people to claim their corpses as there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s too many. Talk to your other friends too if you like.\\\\nAt the morgue, there is a Creepy Guy in a porcupine suit. Claim your \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x98brother\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99, and go west to check. When you come back out, Glavine will be trying to ruin things for you. You can tell him off, and then continue talking to the Creepy Guy to get your money. As tempting as it is to hit Glavine, there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s no point.\\\\nClara gets an idea to retrieve a film for the museum curator on Konrad Street. The theatre on Holden Street stole the film, so let\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s go there. No way to get in except:\\\\nATTACK WINDOW WITH PISTOL\\\\nS (make sure the cop doesn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t see you)\\\\nN \\\\nENTER WINDOW\\\\nUP \\\\nNow we\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re in the projection booth and have three film rolls: grey, black and silver. The silver one is the missing film, but you need to watch it to know. You can take the other ones and watch them too, by PUT (COLOUR) IN PROJECTOR and TURN PROJECTOR ON.\\\\n(I\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ve tried going into the pawn shop in a replay to see if you could sell the film, but no staff are available, so there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s no \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x98evil\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99 option)\\\\nGo back to the museum and talk to the curator. You don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t even need to officially get the mission first to get the reward.\\\\nKill Hitler. You can even get $75 for it! In an alley near Loome Street amongst the twisty passages, there is a bar to the south that you will find him in. I only needed to attack twice.\\\\n\\\\nJUST FOR FUN\\\\nEvery place normally has a joke attached to it, or a certain backstory if you can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t go into it. Go everywhere as Yar\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s clever enough not to go into dangerous places.\\\\nThe tea room is Cheers without Alcohol.\\\\nDeath punches you in an alleyway near Holden. Attack Death once and he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s gone. You can still die in this game from other battles though, but Clara will find you even hotter.\\\\nThere\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Bigby Burrito. Sometimes you will hear customers grumble in the never-moving queue, but you can hear some hints on what else can be done.\\\\nThe Hacker Hall of Shame is a museum with four exhibits.\\\\nThe Unitarian Hall plays a film after you go through a procedure.\\\\nYou can also play the Sega Saturn at Porn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s place after the same procedure. Still got it!\\\\n\\\\nCOWBOY BEBOP\\\\nThe best freelance paycheque you can get is with four bounties. Dapper is listed, but not an option. Information on bounties is available at the Registrar\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Office (X WANTED POSTER and T INFOBOT) and they can be collected at the Post Office (T CLERK). The missing poster shows that one Monica Simmons is very similar to our described Post Office Clerk, but this seems to be an aborted arc so you can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t talk to her about it or take the posters.\\\\n\\\\nSCOREZ\\\\nThis available bounty is unpleasant, but you can do so at any time and no risk to yourself.\\\\nAt any bus station, ENTER BUS.\\\\nIf you don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t remember Scorez\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s name from the Infobot, or got on the bus right away, Porn will see Scorez and point out how vile he is anyway. He needs to be stopped. You\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re unlikely to win a fight against Admiral Scorez, but you can keep the little girl he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s trying to groom safe by talking to her.\\\\nTALK TO THE LITTLE GIRL. Do this twice. Telling her not to talk to strangers, and reminding her of your local hero status on the news works best, so option 2 is what you go with in both cases.\\\\nNow you have the little girl\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s trust and you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re her designated acquaintance to help her home. Scorez will angrily get off the bus and stand in front of it. His telephone conversation shows something terrible may happen to the bus, and the driver\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s furious.\\\\nTALK TO THE DRIVER. Do this twice.\\\\nThen you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll convince him to do the right thing: run over Scorez. Don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t worry about the little girl after this as she lives near Konrad Street and will get off shortly. I think there was an option to take her to her doorstep, but it was a deleted arc, sadly.\\\\nYou don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t need to get on the bus again except for convenience. EXIT BUS at any stop you like. Go to the Post Office for your bounty.\\\\n\\\\nMCCORMICK\\\\nThis one\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s dangerous, and it\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s easy to make the mistake of wanting him gone now and miss out on a few areas. No difference game-wise and you still get your bounty though. \\\\nGo to the Music Store to see your friend Vaughan. You\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll have to ATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL, move east, attack a few times before McCormick gives up and goes south. Vaughan is now safe, but make sure he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s okay. Go in, talk with him and get some money on your card and a hint to McCormick\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s next location. Go to the condemned building on Duffy Street, which is actually a front for cock-fighting. McCormick will go upstairs with some company.\\\\nIf you have some ree and your health is low, take it. If not, go to the dealer near the pawn shop on Grotto Street.\\\\nUP\\\\nATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL until he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s gone. You can take his stuff, but surprisingly there is no need for the defibrillator. \\\\nIf you like you can T PROSTITUTE and escort her to a nightclub you conveniently can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t enter because you have no ID. Go to the Post Office to get your bounty.\\\\n\\\\nFAILED ROMERO\\\\nThis one takes place in the robotics shop on Konrad Street. ENTER STORE.\\\\nT WOMAN. Her name is Tera if you go for 1 first.\\\\nAGAIN until you snap and find out the reason for her curt attitude. Failed Romero, her creation, is returning.\\\\nPorn knows what to do. T PORN. You need to buy him some time.\\\\nT TERA but this fails to save her.\\\\nT ROMERO. Option 2.\\\\nT ROMERO. Option 2.\\\\nNo need to attack, he will be shut down.\\\\nEXIT STORE and return to the Post Office to collect your bounty.\\\\n\\\\nLEANDRA\\\\nThis starts with a few small-cash jobs that will eventually give you the starting clue to collect her bounty. You don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t have to do all this in one go.\\\\nLightspeed Couriers\\\\nT CLERK. You need to get a handprint of the recipient on the scanner the clerk hands you to get paid and the package opened.\\\\nGo to the address in Holden. This is the battered low-income multiple housing complex on the east, between Holden and Loome.\\\\nThere\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s nothing in this dirty living room except a keg which doesn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t seem much cleaner, given the way Porn reacts to the beer inside it. Let\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s go into the kitchen, our tenant may be here.\\\\nENTER and EXIT are your verbs for the kitchen.\\\\nENTER KITCHEN\\\\nX BODY\\\\nWell, that\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s not helpful for us. We just needed a handprint.\\\\nX LAPTOP (You can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t use it, but there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s a CD drive)\\\\nEXIT KITCHEN\\\\nX KEG\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\nX BEER\\\\nNow, you probably already know what the pink bits are, but to retrieve it, you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll have to LOOK INSIDE KEG and then TAKE HAND. PUT HAND ON SCANNER. Now the package is open. TAKE CD. You can ENTER KITCHEN and PUT CD IN LAPTOP. There\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s nowhere to sell the information as I can tell. Now we can return to the couriers and get a small amount of cash for our work. Unfortunately, you can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t sell the hand to the morgue after you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re done.\\\\nGetting Borick\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Cheque\\\\nGo to the tattoo parlour. Borick will be complaining to Jake about someone who owes him a cheque. So, TALK TO BORICK about it. He\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll give you a name and mention the guy\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s a college student, though he won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t give you a tattoo.\\\\nLook up the name on the Infobot. Do we know any students? Not very well, as he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s dead. Since Yar prints out a pre-decomposition photo of him, we have the basis of our identity theft.\\\\nGo to the Living Mask store. Remember to take your credit card and have it in your hand when you ask the talented man to help you. Our guy will take a few turns to get the mask done, so you might as well do some of the other jobs and bounties before coming back. \\\\nWEAR MASK\\\\nGo to the Post Office. T CLERK to get the cheque.\\\\nBeing honest with your employer is the best policy, as it was with the film roll. Go back to the Tattoo Parlour. Give the cheque to Borick, and he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll give you a pager and tell your trustworthy self about a goal of his: tattooing the hacker Leandra Jones in revenge. If you find her, page him and he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll arrive in a few turns- and you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll still get your bounty. \\\\nGiving you Leandra\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s full name is a valuable tip, so go to the Infobot for her last-known address.\\\\nYou can finally enter the townhouse on the very west point of Loome Street. Knock on the door and the sobbing guy will let you open it.\\\\nThe sobbing guy is Mitchell, Leandra\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s ex-boyfriend.\\\\nT MITCHELL. Ask \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x98Where is she now?\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99 to hasten the process. Clara will slap some sense into him. Leandra\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s moved to Pang Street, east of here. Remember that apartment we can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t get into? You can beat up Mitchell afterwards, but there\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s no point.\\\\nIf you aren\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t full on health, buying some Ree would be smart before you go any further.\\\\nWhen you get to Pang Street, get your pistol out of your backpack. The door is to the north.\\\\nKNOCK ON DOOR\\\\nOh great, another thug answers.\\\\nENTER APARTMENT\\\\nUP\\\\nUP\\\\nYou have to get rid of the thug before you can enter Leandra\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s apartment anyway. ATTACK THUG WITH PISTOL and AGAIN until he\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s gone. If you need to escape to take some Ree, go DOWN.\\\\nENTER APARTMENT\\\\nAs soon as you can see Leandra, ACTIVATE PAGER.\\\\nWhatever you say won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t matter, but to keep Leandra in her apartment until Borick arrives, you may have to attack her a few times right after she rummages her drawer and removes another problem.\\\\nBorick will show up, knock her out for you if you haven\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t done so already, have his revenge and give you some cash.\\\\nEXIT APARTMENT\\\\nDOWN \\\\nDOWN\\\\nEXIT APARTMENT\\\\nGo back to the Post Office to collect your bounty.\\\\n\\\\nPorn\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Donation Drive\\\\nGo to the Medical Centre. The receptionist will take Porn to another room for his regular visit, so you might as well X MAGAZINE while you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re waiting and learn about neurosurgery. No more pussy-footing. If you can get your head fixed you can easily make the money you need and experience the joys of electronics. Porn will generously give you the $25 from his monthly donation and then you can TALK TO THE RECEPTIONIST. 1 will tell her all of your troubles and you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll get a quote for the surgery to help you if you keep talking to her. If you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ve followed this walkthrough in the order of writing, this won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t be a problem.\\\\nInternet Caf\\\\xc3\\\\x83\\\\xc2\\\\xa9\\\\nHere you can put your skills to the test. One terminal is free.\\\\nUSE COMPUTER. You haven\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t lost your touch.\\\\nSoon after this, if you go back to this area again after a few turns, Johnny Dapper will appear and either take $2331 if you have it or the CD you copied if you don\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t. You can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t shoot him or talk your way out of it. Porn will then suggest you either sell your CD of code (or intercept Dapper selling it) at the pawn shop. So, if you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re ready to end the conflict, head there.\\\\nReading time!\\\\nTALK TO NEVE \\\\nA guard will appear who seems like bad news, but is fulfilling a new contract from Porn. You now have a cable.\\\\nPLUG CABLE INTO TERMINAL lets you see where Neve is now, and tells you of an upcoming guard. You\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll have to wait a few turns but now you know. You can ATTACK GUARD WITH CABLE to knock him out, but ATTACK GUARD is the only thing you need.\\\\nHere, ENTER and EXIT are your verbs for all rooms. Outside of the cell, there is a darkened room with an energy pak, west has another storage room with your pistol, and a cafeteria with one guy who recognises you.\\\\nTALK TO BILLY. Billy\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s sympathetic and won\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t hurt you.  Talk to him about everything.\\\\nPUT PAK INTO PISTOL. As far as attacking anyone with the pistol goes, remember you need one charge remaining before you go into the front hall.\\\\n Go west to the stairwell. Upstairs first.\\\\nGo to the lab at the west end. ATTACK NEVE WITH PISTOL. TAKE ALL. You can use her keypass to enter storage for some ree and horror when you remove the sheet.\\\\nDownstairs:\\\\nYou can go into Neve\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s office by unlocking the door with her keypass, but this is more for poignancy than for helping you escape. At the east end of the hall, use Neve\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s pass to unlock the door to the doctor\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s room.\\\\nATTACK PAD WITH PISTOL to survive. Then ATTACK DOCTOR WITH PISTOL until it\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s over. If you have only one charge left, just ATTACK. TAKE ALL, as you need to unlock the reception door with the pass and free money will help with your trip. The ree\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s nice too.\\\\nWhen you go into reception after unlocking the door, SHOOT CHANDELIER. \\\\nEXIT. \\\\nW. \\\\nUNLOCK GARAGE DOOR WITH PASS.\\\\nENTER GARAGE.\\\\nThis is it. This part of the garage houses the door to your escape from all of New Haz. \\\\nX LOG BOOK- the doctor drives the Porsche.\\\\nYour friends are now here. Porn will be warning you of the guards trying to shoot their way in, so get busy. T CLARA. Both will get the strongbox open, but 1 means she\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll go with you even though it hurts. It would hurt a lot more not to tell the truth and 1 saves you a turn.\\\\nTAKE WIRELESS (the wireless key fob is for the Porsche). \\\\nUNLOCK HIGHWAY DOOR WITH BANK CARD to pay off your fictional, final debt and open the door.\\\\nPRESS WIRELESS to open the Porsche doors. Make sure you have taken the wireless as sometimes you can press the button without doing so, and then waste a few turns not realising why you can\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99t drive the car and having to get out to get the keys.\\\\nENTER PORSCHE\\\\nDRIVE PORSCHE into your first dawn ever seen, with your girlfriend by your side and your mate cheering you on (who hopefully escapes later).\\\\n\\']\"b\\'[\"Solution To Farmers Daughter (finally)\\\\n\\\\n                           Wednesday, 14th October, 1998.\\\\n                                     Version 1.0\\\\n\\\\nPreamble\\\\n\\\\n        Farmer\\\\\\'s daughter is an old text adventure for the commodore 64 circa\\\\n1988.

Taking and eating things are most likely to yield a unique response.  It\\\\\\'s not supposed to be an unforgivingly hard game, but there may be a few rare parts where the puzzles are too opaque or the parser asks for too specific a command; if you run into this, you can curse my programming inexperience to the seventh generation, and hopefully this guide will help move things along.

This shows, sometimes badly.\\\\nTechnically, the program is rather restrictive. There are no command recall\\\\nfacilities, not even the ones used by the DOS command line. At least capitals\\\\nare accepted, but never significant. The most unpleasant lack, though, is that\\\\nyou cannot save your game. At least it\\\\\\'s not very long.\\\\n  As far as vocabulary is concerned, it has what it needs and nothing more.\\\\nOnly the first three letters of a word are significant, except where they\\\\naren\\\\\\'t - see below. Some abbreviations are recognised, and some are required;\\\\nspecifically, \"east\" is only recognised as a full word in \"go east\", not on its\\\\nown. You\\\\\\'ll have to use \"e\". This one limitation is not very onerous, of\\\\ncourse. Also, you can\\\\\\'t use \"it\".\\\\n  Another limitation is that this program is very bad for guess-the-verb. At\\\\ntimes, it even needs guess-the-exact-command. Synonyms are not common. \"Get\"\\\\nand \"Take\" will both work, and that\\\\\\'s about it except where a special case has\\\\nbeen accounted for. But those pre-defined commands have their foibles, one of\\\\nwhich is is that they do not always recognise abbreviated words. Some work with\\\\na three-letter abbreviation but not with a four-letter one. Some demand the\\\\nentire noun but allow the verb to be abbreviated; some do not. Using the entire\\\\nwords in all commands would be best, which makes it all the more inconsistent\\\\nthat \"east\" is not recognised on its own. And, of course, where I\\\\\\'ve used \"the\"\\\\nbelow to make the text read better, omit it.\\\\n  Those special cases have another problem: they are not accepted except in the\\\\nvery circumstances for which they have been anticipated. Everywhere else they\\\\nwill be treated as if you typed nonsense, or give a non-committal message such\\\\nas \"nothing happens\" where \"that is not here\" would be a more appropriate.\\\\nSimilarly, \"look object\" and \"read object\" are not the same thing even where\\\\nthey should be - in at least one case, \"look object\" says \"nothing to be read\",\\\\nbut \"read object\" tells you what is written on it!\\\\n  Real bugs are, as far as I have found, rare. That is to say, bugs which\\\\naffect gameplay seem rare. You need to be careful not to lose your dog before\\\\nyou get him - that seems to be all. Cosmetic bugs are much more common. One or\\\\ntwo messages seem incomplete, but the most common bug is that room descriptions\\\\nremain static when they shouldn\\\\\\'t - objects remain in view when you take them,\\\\nthat sort of thing. Misspelled words are also common.\\\\n  Finally, since this is a walkthrough, spoilers are rife below. I\\\\\\'m not taking\\\\nyou past every single clue and sight - in fact, I\\\\\\'m not taking you past any.\\\\nAll code numbers I\\\\\\'ll be giving you can be found in the game somewhere. As\\\\nmentioned above, the Look and Read commands are not always helpful, but they do\\\\noccasionally reveal something useful. Therefore, look at everything before you\\\\nresort to this walkthrough, and if you accidentally read the solution to a\\\\nproblem you hadn\\\\\\'t come across yet, don\\\\\\'t blame me.\\\\n\\\\n  Now, let\\\\\\'s go and get that treasure.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  You start in Getfeldt\\\\\\'s garden. Go east, take the crowbar, and go west and\\\\nsouth. Use the crowbar. (Yes, \"use\". Tsk, tsk... naughty implementor.) Drop the\\\\ncrowbar. Open door, go east and north. Move the painting. You\\\\\\'re asked for a\\\\ncombination, which is 121513. Yes, a hint this can be found elsewhere in the\\\\ngame. No, I\\\\\\'m not telling you where. Serves you right for reading walkthroughs.\\\\nTake and wear the amulet.\\\\n  Go s, s, e. Open the refrigerator (\"fridge\" is not recognised) and take the\\\\nsteak. Go east. Now (and you must enter this as one command, nor will you be\\\\nallowed to proceed until you do) \"give steak\". Get the treats, and give treat.\\\\nIf you now check your inventory, you\\\\\\'ll find that you are carrying the dog!\\\\n  Pull the lever and go down. Take the gear and the balloon. Go east twice.\\\\nUnlock the door - the code is 6603243e. Go east twice more, then north and up.\\\\nStart the engine and set the navigation. You\\\\\\'ll be asked for the coordinates,\\\\nwhich are 121.15.09:34.09.12 - and you\\\\\\'ve already come across these, although\\\\nI haven\\\\\\'t told you explicitly where to find them. \\\\n  Go east twice. Wear your gear, then go down and north. First turn the wheel,\\\\nthen the handle. Go east. Close the door, and when asked which, enter /~\\\\\\\\I\\\\n(slash, tilde, backslash, single I: the \"one\" version of the visible door\\\\\\'s\\\\n\"two\"). Now \"push green\". Do not \"push green pad\" - that doesn\\\\\\'t work. Turn\\\\nthe cross.\\\\n  Go east, look shelf, take batteries, go east, take flashlight. Go south. Put\\\\nbatteries in flashlight. Drop the flashlight, batteries (yes, you have to drop\\\\nthem individually even though you just put them in the flashlight), balloon,\\\\ngear and treats. Go west. Put amulet in star, get chest, go east. No, all your\\\\nstuff hasn\\\\\\'t disappeared. It\\\\\\'s still here, it\\\\\\'s just not shown in the room\\\\ndescription.\\\\n  Take the gear and balloon - leave the rest. Go back n, w, w. Take the net.\\\\nWear the gear. Close the door - enter /~\\\\\\\\II, that is, slash, tilde, backslash,\\\\ndouble I - push red and go west. Put chest in net. Attach net. You\\\\\\'ll be asked\\\\n\"to what\" - enter \"ring\", as a single word. Don\\\\\\'t ask me why this command could\\\\nnot be handled in the same way as \"put object in object\", but if you try that,\\\\nyou get told to \"slow down\". Pull the tab.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  Hooray - you have beaten Getfeldt. Although there are messages spread around\\\\nthe game which make it uncertain how much you\\\\\\'ve actually \"beaten\" him and how\\\\nmuch of it was his idea all along. In any case, you\\\\\\'re now rich, so no matter\\\\nwho was the mastermind, it counts as a victory for you!\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'(version 1.0 of this walkthrough -- 11/12/03)\\\\n(by Daphne Brinkerhoff -- cendare@hotmail.com)\\\\n\\\\nWALKTHROUGH FOR GHOST TRAIN\\\\n                -----------\\\\n\\\\n_Ghost Train_, by Paul Johnson, is available at\\\\n\\\\nhttp://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/ghost.z8\\\\n\\\\n(you may need to watch for line breaks in the above URL)\\\\n\\\\nThis file is a little discursive, including some actions which are not\\\\nnecessary to complete the game. However, they should make the experience\\\\nmore enjoyable. The exact phrases you will need to type into the\\\\ninterpreter are in ALL CAPS.\\\\n\\\\nThis walkthrough is based on\\\\nRelease 4 / Serial number 070503 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nON THE FIRST TRAIN\\\\n------------------\\\\n\\\\nBasically your goal is to wait around a few turns. READ NEWSPAPER, TALK\\\\nTO INGRID, KISS INGRID, and be sure to X INGRID. She\\\\\\'s wearing a\\\\nnecklace; X NECKLACE. You can take INVENTORY and X TICKET too. Whatever\\\\nyou do, after a few turns there will be an accident.\\\\n\\\\nAFTER THE ACCIDENT\\\\n------------------\\\\n\\\\nNow you\\\\\\'re in \"blackness. A sleepy unconscious state.\" You want to WAKE.\\\\n\\\\nLook at the wreckage! No, really, LOOK AT WRECKAGE. You can X BODIES, X\\\\nDEBRIS, SEARCH BODIES, and SEARCH DEBRIS too, but it won\\\\\\'t get you\\\\nanything nifty. Instead go SOUTH. (You could go north, but it would only\\\\ntake you to an endless set of tracks, so why bother?) X LIGHT and X BOX\\\\nhere, then go WEST, UP, and WEST again to enter the signal box. You\\\\\\'ll\\\\nsee a ghostly train go by beneath you, but you don\\\\\\'t have to worry about\\\\nit.\\\\n\\\\nWell, you were looking for a phone, so X PHONE and it tells you how to\\\\nuse it. TURN HANDLE for some more atmosphere. Next, look at other things\\\\naround you. X NECKLACE (look familiar?), X COIN, X LEVER, X PANEL. You\\\\ncan GET the COIN and NECKLACE. You can PULL and PUSH the LEVER, but I\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t think it does anything useful. Notice that the panel is loosely\\\\nattached--PULL PANEL, then LOOK to see what you\\\\\\'ve uncovered. GET KEY.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s all here, so EAST, DOWN, and EAST to get back to the tracks. The\\\\nstrange figure you saw earlier has left a lamp. X LAMP and GET IT. Go on\\\\nto the SOUTH. You can X WALLS and X LICHEN for some more atmosphere, and\\\\nyou can even X WATER and DRINK WATER. Then go SOUTH again.\\\\n\\\\nSee the writing on the door? READ WRITING. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY and\\\\ngo WEST into...\\\\n\\\\nTHE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nGo NORTH so you can interact with things.\\\\n\\\\nX CLOCK, X POSTERS, READ SIGN. Notice that the train comes at 10:30 and\\\\nthe clock thinks it\\\\\\'s 10:24 right now. Then go NORTH into the waiting\\\\nroom.\\\\n\\\\nThe ghost will call your name, but you can ignore it for a moment. X\\\\nBOOKS, READ BOOKS, READ NEWSPAPER, X SOFA, SIT ON SOFA will all give you\\\\nmore atmospheric messages. Then you can deal with the ghost. X WINDOW\\\\nand wait a turn, then the ghost asks \"Fares Please\". Then X GHOST. He\\\\nwants you to buy a ticket, so GIVE COIN TO GHOST.\\\\n\\\\nOkay, notice the clock is ticking again--at 10:30 the train will be out\\\\nat the track. But spare a second to X TICKET to see where you\\\\\\'re\\\\ngoing... a cemetery... brrr. Then go SOUTH and wait until the train\\\\narrives. Once it does, go SOUTH again to enter it.\\\\n\\\\nON THE SECOND TRAIN\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\nPay attention to the colors of the carriages here, and write them down\\\\nin order. It will come in handy later.\\\\n\\\\nIn room #1 (the westernmost room) is a red door which is locked. In room\\\\n#6 is a locked door.\\\\n\\\\nAlso in that room is a Ouija board. If you hang around a moment, the\\\\nspirits will spell out \"HELP US\" on the board. X BOARD--you can ask it\\\\nabout things just as though it were a real person. Sometime about now,\\\\nyou may get strange messages about mice running through the room, or you\\\\nmay hear footsteps on the roof of the train. That\\\\\\'s okay. It\\\\\\'s just\\\\nrandom atmospheric stuff.\\\\n\\\\nGo ahead and ASK BOARD ABOUT whatever you can think of, including: ME,\\\\nTRAIN, GHOST, TICKET. But to continue, you must ASK BOARD ABOUT INGRID,\\\\nand the door to your east will open. Go EAST and be confronted by a dead\\\\nman rotting. Make sure you read his description carefully, especially\\\\nthe mention of his badge. You can\\\\\\'t actually interact with him yet,\\\\nthough. Notice the key--X BLACK KEY and GET IT. *Now* you\\\\\\'ve woken up\\\\nthe dead guy. GIVE TICKET TO GHOST and he\\\\\\'ll leave you alone.\\\\n\\\\nReturn to room #1 (go WEST six times) and UNLOCK DOOR WITH BLACK KEY.\\\\nThen go WEST twice to enter the train\\\\\\'s cab. You\\\\\\'ll see a bunch of\\\\ncontrols, which you may want to fiddle with yourself before continuing\\\\nwith this walkthrough.\\\\n\\\\nYour goal is to get the train to stop. The brake wheel looks\\\\npromising--TURN BRAKE WHEEL. That slowed it, but didn\\\\\\'t stop it. PULL\\\\nLEVER to finish the job. Then DOWN to get out of the train.\\\\n\\\\nCEMETERY AND CHAPEL\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\nGo NORTH to the cemetery proper. X STONES and it mentions a particular\\\\ninscription. READ INSCRIPTION--you don\\\\\\'t want it to be true, but it is.\\\\nIngrid\\\\\\'s gone. Unless... NORTHWEST takes you to a fairy dance. X\\\\nDANCERS, and then go NORTH to the chapel.\\\\n\\\\nX CHAPEL and NORTH takes you inside. X INSCRIPTION. X BIBLE and try to\\\\nGET IT. You can X PEWS and X LECTERN too, if you want. Then go EAST to\\\\nthe bell room. An empty room, except for that rope. You can PULL ROPE to\\\\nring the bell, but it doesn\\\\\\'t do much for you. X ROPE hints at the\\\\nproper thing to do... You want to CLIMB ROPE.\\\\n\\\\n(I like to PULL ROPE again when I\\\\\\'m at the top of it, right next to the\\\\nbell. But then, I read Dorothy Sayers\\\\\\' _Nine Tailors_.)\\\\n\\\\nThe language here is a little weird. GET PARCHMENT and then X PARCHMENT.\\\\nX BOOKS tells you to search for things by name... You saw the name of\\\\nthe church is St. Gorgon (although it was spelled differently), so\\\\nSEARCH GORGON and GET EXORCISM. READ EXORCISM for some colorful\\\\nlanguage, but nothing else of use. CLIMB ROPE to get back down (\"down\"\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\'t work, for some reason). WEST and SOUTH to leave the chapel.\\\\n\\\\nNow, you want to go around back. So NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST. X GARGOYLE\\\\nand READ INSCRIPTION. Aha, a clue. Go back to the dancers by going\\\\nSOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, then SOUTH. Then ASK DANCERS ABOUT GARGOYLE. The\\\\ndancer will kiss you, so I like to KISS DANCERS in return. Then go back\\\\nto the chapel and do what the dancers said--three times around,\\\\ncounterclockwise. You\\\\\\'ll end up in back of the chapel having a chat with\\\\nSatan.\\\\n\\\\nHe asks who dares to call him back; TELL SATAN ABOUT ME. You\\\\\\'ve only got\\\\none thing on your mind, so ASK SATAN ABOUT INGRID. Uh-oh, is there any\\\\nway to save her? ASK SATAN ABOUT HELL. (If this is clued, I don\\\\\\'t know\\\\nwhere.) Obviously you have to answer \"YES\". Satan gives you an hour (60\\\\nturns) to do what must be done.\\\\n\\\\nYou end up at a funeral service, before an open grave. There\\\\\\'s no reason\\\\nto know this, but you have to ENTER OPEN GRAVE. DOWN takes you to a pair\\\\nof eyes, asking about you. TELL EYES ABOUT ME and then go WEST. X HOUND\\\\nto get his name. Pluto (and you can try to go down if you want, but\\\\nhe\\\\\\'ll stop you). Go back EAST and ASK EYES ABOUT PLUTO. Now it\\\\\\'s safe to\\\\ngo WEST and DOWN. DOWN again, and EAST to... yet another train.\\\\n\\\\nTHE THIRD TRAIN\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\nX SWITCH to see which way the train is headed now (northeast), then UP\\\\nto enter the train.\\\\n\\\\nOPEN BOX to get a message from Ingrid telling you your goal, then go\\\\nNORTH to this train\\\\\\'s cab.\\\\n\\\\nThe controls are mostly the same as the other train, except that you\\\\nmust turn the switch to face northwest first, using the colored levers.\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s where the colors of the second train come in handy... Pull the\\\\ncolored levers in the order that the carriages were colored in that\\\\ntrain (type PULL RED, PULL BLUE, etc.). I don\\\\\\'t actually think it\\\\nchanges with each game--I think it\\\\\\'s always RRBBGR (R = red, B = blue, G\\\\n= green).\\\\n\\\\nNow you just have to get the train moving. Remember how the other one\\\\nwas stopped? Well, do those things in reverse. PUSH REGULATOR LEVER and\\\\nTURN BRAKE WHEEL.\\\\n\\\\nIf you read the plaque, it will give you a hint how you can escape the\\\\ndemon: TURN DAMPER, twice.\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations, you win!\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'Solution to \"Groove Billygoat\" by Efrain Finnell\\\\n\\\\nThis is the \"quick and dirty\" walkthrough that skips a lot of detail.\\\\nThere is some randomness you may need to account for.\\\\nIt is suggested you use the in-game hints (type HINT) before resorting\\\\nto the walkthrough.\\\\n\\\\nFirst:\\\\nGO IN\\\\nGO OUT\\\\nWAIT (for about 15 turns or fiddle with your inventory)\\\\n\\\\nThe Orphans will escape and Betsy will start singing you a song.

You get 20 points for each object, so your score level will\\\\ntell you whether you have got a correct item.\\\\nSome of the artifacts are useless, except for scoring purposes, but\\\\nothers are needed to solve puzzles in the game.\\\\nTo get the Vogon ship to fly, read the book of poetry in the Vogon\\\\nNavigation room (where the poetry is graffitti\\\\\\'d on the wall).\\\\nTo get the \\\\\\'Heart of Gold\\\\\\' to fly, drop the rusty old engine in the\\\\ncontrol room and push the lever (As the sign says: Don\\\\\\'t pull the\\\\nlever).\\\\nGet the babel fish before giving the Arkleseizure a drink.\\\\nUse the coin to buy the chocolate first - don\\\\\\'t use it on the Nutrimat\\\\nuntil you have the chocolate.\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - \\\\n2/  HH-64 Walkthrough\\\\n\\\\n[Note: if you prefer the solution to be compacted into fewer lines, just\\\\nhighlight the text and replace all the line breaks with commas.]\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\nN\\\\nGet bowl\\\\nDrop bowl\\\\nLook\\\\nGet keys\\\\nE\\\\nU\\\\nN\\\\nE\\\\nE\\\\nGet steak\\\\nGet gun\\\\nW\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nD\\\\nW\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nW\\\\nOn gun\\\\nU\\\\nShoot Vogon (or Shoot captain)\\\\n[The gun is only used to shoot Vogons.

As soon as I saw the first line (\"Hi there, guys, I\\\\\\'m Bugsy,\\\\nyour lovable computer companion.\"), I knew it was the same game -\\\\nespecially since \\\\\\'Bob Chappell\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'Supersoft\\\\\\' appear in reverse video\\\\non the screen.\\\\n\\\\nIf you play this game, you will see that it is exactly the same game as\\\\nHH-64.  The only differences are that the reference to Douglas Adams and\\\\nPan Books has been removed, and all the objects and places have been\\\\nsuperficially renamed.  However, it is obvious by the names that the\\\\nHitch Hikers Guide version came first:  all the Cosmic Capers names keep\\\\nthe same kind of format (for want of a better term): the \\\\\\'bowl of\\\\npetunias\\\\\\' becomes a \\\\\\'vase of pansies\\\\\\', the \\\\\\'Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of\\\\nTraal\\\\\\' becomes the \\\\\\'Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo\\\\\\', and so on.  And it\\\\nis unlikely that Cosmic Capers was first with the idea of bad alien\\\\npoetry!\\\\n\\\\nSo, if you want to solve \\\\\\'Cosmic Capers\\\\\\', just follow the walkthrough\\\\nand use the appropriate nouns (eg, \\\\\\'SHOOT VERRUCAN rather than SHOOT\\\\nVOGON).\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - \\\\n4/ Miscellaneous\\\\n\\\\nI was stuck on this game for a very long time (somewhere between 13 - 14\\\\nyears, in fact, but this included several years without a C64).  I\\\\nfinally found the solution on a disk of adventure game solutions created\\\\nusing the Vizawrite 64 word processor.  I loaded up \"The Hitch Hikers\"\\\\nfile to test the disk, expecting it to be the solution for the Infocom\\\\ngame, and was bowled over when it turned out to be a walkthrough for the\\\\nSupersoft title!  Being in an 80 column format (on a 40 column screen),\\\\nI had to take two screen dumps and then stick them together in order to\\\\nprint the solution out.  When I got home, however, I found that the\\\\nwalkthrough missed a number of steps - a fairly common problem when\\\\npeople write solutions down as they play the game.  Having used the\\\\nsolution to get past my sticking point, I managed to finish the game\\\\nwith a bit of judicious mapping.  I must say that after having waited so\\\\nmany years, the ending was quite a disappointment!\\\\n\\\\nThere is a Spectrum version of this game (HH-64), which states it is (c)\\\\nEstuary Software Products.  It does not say who the programmer was, or\\\\nwhat year it was made.  There is also no reference to whether ESP and\\\\nSupersoft are the same software house, or one version was licensed from\\\\nthe other.  I have always wondered whether HH-64 was  truly a piece of\\\\ncommercial software, or if the \\\\\\'by kind permission\\\\\\' line was just a bit\\\\nof fun added to a \\\\\\'tribute\\\\\\' game by some keen fan.  However, it is\\\\nstrange to find a non-commercial game popping up on two separate\\\\nplatforms (unless one was just a home-attempt on one platform at\\\\nreproducing the commercial version from another platform?).\\\\n\\\\nA post was made on internet news in Nov-Dec 98 by a person who claimed\\\\nto have programmed an intro to the game.  They were looking for a copy\\\\nof the file as they couldn\\\\\\'t find it anywhere on the internet.  Having\\\\nsearched both comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm, I have not been able\\\\nto find a copy of this post either to reproduce it here or obtain the\\\\nposters e-mail address in order to get more information from them.\\\\nPossibly the question was posted on rec.arts.int-fiction.\\\\n\\\\nObviously HH-64 had to have been released before Infocom got the rights\\\\nto create a HHG game.  According to the \\\\\\'Infocom Fact Sheet VIII:\\\\nChronology\\\\\\' by Paul David Doherty, the Infocom HHG was released in\\\\nOctober 1984.  I have a note that I bought my copy of this game in\\\\nAugust 1985 (compiled 21st December 1984, if you\\\\\\'re interested).  My\\\\npreliminary map for HH-64 appears before this entry in my map book, and\\\\nit is dated \\\\\\'1st May\\\\\\'.  Whether that is 1984 or 1985 I cannot tell.\\\\n\\\\nNo information on HH-64 can be found on the Adventure Games List\\\\nmaintained by Hans Persson and kept on ftp.gmd.de at\\\\nif-archive/info/adventure-game-history.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n/Andrew.\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\"[\\'General tips:\\\\n\\\\nBest weapons:\\\\ncleaver (village, in store) strength 10\\\\nbattleaxe (eastern forest, grass roof hut) strength 18\\\\nfire whip (mystic cave, held by golem) strength 22\\\\n\\\\nMost wearables has no effect, but the armor and shield (village, paladin)\\\\noccasionally heal you, and the cloak (elf) occasionally increases your damage.\\\\n\\\\nThere are two NPCs who can help you in combat\\\\nWerewolf (in mansion)\\\\nTursk (in caverns)\\\\n\\\\nEating the rations (village, tavern) will give you an extra 200 hp and refill\\\\nyour food count.

Sometimes, in-game events may lead to a special speech option or opportunity if one is in your party at the time, so I will note those throughout this walkthrough using the following symbols:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 Marlowe\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x96 Lich Battlemaster\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x86 Daechiron\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, some situations play out differently depending on your class. These will be denoted by the following:\\\\n\\\\nR Rogue\\\\nW Warrior\\\\nM Mage\\\\n\\\\nLastly, it is theoretically possible to completely fill the in-game BESTIARY with every enemy. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 will denote options that allow you to do this, if you have this as a goal and the enemy can otherwise be easily missed. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n---Contents---\\\\n\\\\ni. Prologue\\\\nii. Lornely Forest\\\\niii. Eastern Hold \\\\niv. Southern Hold\\\\nv. Bestiary/Enemy Guide\\\\nvi. Item Guide\\\\n\\\\n---Prologue: Gameplay Overview and Character Creation--\\\\nThe essentials of gameplay are also described in the in-game HELP SECTION. \\\\n\\\\nCombat is turn-based. You can use spells or skills, which deplete your MP or SP respectively. When fully depleted, you can only use your basic attack, which is modified according to your equipped weapon. An enemy may have a single weakness and/or a single immunity. If the skill, spell, or weapon you use has a type that matches the enemy\\\\\\'s weakness, it will do double damage. However, if it matches the enemy\\\\\\'s immunity, it will do no damage. Once an enemy has been defeated, its information and description, including weaknesses and immunities, can be viewed from the BESTIARY in the MENU. \\\\n\\\\nA companion may help you in combat each turn, though you have the option to tell them to hold back, meaning they will not make a move that turn. If told to attack, the companion will use a random one of their known moves on the enemy.\\\\n\\\\nPROS: \\\\n-weaknesses and immunities do not apply to a companion\\\\\\'s moves\\\\n-companions do not deplete their SP/MP\\\\n-the foe will never target a companion, meaning they cannot take damage in combat\\\\n\\\\nCONS:\\\\n-companions\\\\\\' skillsets are fixed; you cannot change their skills/spells or equipment\\\\n-IF A COMPANION KILLS THE FOE, YOU WILL EARN NO XP.\\\\n\\\\nThe last bullet is essentially a mechanism to prevent your companion from becoming a crutch for the entire game. While your companion can easily destroy earlier enemies, you will find that even with your companion attacking later-game enemies will kill you easily. To prevent this, the best strategy is to earn XP by finishing enemies yourself. Many foes, especially early-game enemies, can be tackled on your own. Use your companion to strategically weaken tougher foes, but be cautious to always save the last blow for yourself.\\\\n\\\\nYou can speak to companions at any time from the MENU. They will offer insight or commentary about your current location, and you can have deeper conversations with them that will change their relationships with you. Companions will also have unique dialogue for each location of the game. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the MENU, you can access your INVENTORY, where you can view descriptions of items, equip them, or use them. Each \\\\\\'chapter\\\\\\' of the game contains a shop somewhere, and at these shops you can sell items you don\\\\\\'t need or want, or buy new stuff. \\\\n\\\\nThere are three main \\\\\\'chapters\\\\\\' of the game. As the game warns you, once you move on, you cannot return to a previous chapter\\\\\\'s area. \\\\n\\\\nYou can recruit a single companion at a time. You can dismiss your companion at any time, but if dismissed, a companion will leave your game and cannot be found and recruited again. A companion can be spoken to at any time from your MENU. \\\\n\\\\nAt the beginning of your game, you select your class and character. Classes have the following characteristics:\\\\n\\\\nMAGE: Mages have the lowest defense, but high SP and the ability to use a variety of skills. Mage strategy involves finding and equipping powerful spells, and using foes\\\\\\' weaknesses and immunities to their advantage. \\\\n\\\\nROGUE: Rogues have moderate defense and deal moderate damage. Due to their speed, rogues will always go first in combat. Rogues can only equip bows, so they generally want to find and equip stronger bows throughout the game. Rogues have access to moderate SP, so they can make up for the lesser damage they do (compared to Warriors) by a slightly greater use of skills.\\\\n\\\\nWARRIOR: Warriors have the highest defense and deal the most damage. They can equip swords. Warriors have the lowest SP, so they rely the least on the use of skills. \\\\n\\\\nThe final step before gameplay is selecting your character\\\\\\'s gender. The player character in this game is less a player-defined avatar and more a character in their own right. \\\\n\\\\nSelecting Male will allow you to play as ALDER, and Female will allow you to play as ASPEN. They are essentially canon alternate-universe versions of each other, and so which you choose has relatively little bearing on the overall plot; it will, however, change how certain NPCs interact with you to some degree. These differences will be noted throughout this walkthrough. \\\\n\\\\n---I. Lornely Forest---\\\\n\\\\nThe story begins with ALDER/ASPEN traveling past Lannerspeak with ill timing, right before the murder of Lord Lanner. No matter which options you select here, you will be accused of the murder and chased into the forest on foot by the guards. Here is where the story essentially opens up. You begin by the dead tree you evaded the guards in. From here, heading to the scratching leads to a dead end. \\\\n\\\\nHeading to the burbling will take you to the stream, while the smell of smoke will take you to Marlowe\\\\\\'s campfire. You can travel in any order, so the order I describe is not the only way.\\\\n\\\\n-If you head to the campfire, you will be immediately confronted by Marlowe. Either responding or silently complying will put him a little more at ease, while continuing to hide will lead him to give you one more chance to come forward into the light, after which he will instantly kill you and you will be returned to the save point. When he asks what you\\\\\\'re doing, \"I could ask you the same\" will peacably end the confrontation but will slightly reduce his favor of you, while \"Running from a crime I didn\\\\\\'t commit\" will end will simply end the confrontation. Regardless of which you choose, you are free leave or return to the campsite at will after this. \\\\n\\\\nSleeping by the fire will fully restore your HP and MP/SP. You can return to heal at it as many times as you need to. At the campsite, you also have the option to recruit Marlowe as your companion. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 If you want to try for the complete bestiary, you\\\\\\'ll want Marlowe as your companion for later on. \\\\n\\\\n-If you head to the stream: there is a chance that on the way there, you\\\\\\'ll be attacked by a Spideer. These are the weakest enemies in the game and should give you no trouble, but you\\\\\\'ll have the chance to figure out combat for the first time. \\\\n\\\\nCrossing the stream will take you in the direction of the cave, which is optional, while following the stream will take you in the direction of continuing the story. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the stream, you can select \"Something gleams by the water\\\\\\'s edge\" to find the leatherbound journal, which contains the clues needed to get through the forest thicket across the stream. \\\\n\\\\n-If you cross the stream: you will encounter the forest thicket. At each clearing, the trail splits into four options, each beside a tree with a symbol carved into it. Selecting the wrong trail at any point will magically return you to the start of the thicket. \\\\n\\\\nThe clues to the answer come from the historical excerpt in the journal; the correct answer of the trees essentially follows the key figures in the order they are mentioned. In the first clearing, the Snake represents Taline Kasabian; in the second, the dragon represents SERVAAS, and in the third and final clearing, the falcon represents the Lanners. \\\\n\\\\nAs you emerge from the clearing, there is a good chance you\\\\\\'ll be attacked by a Restless Ghost. The Restless Ghost is relatively weak, but also has a fire weakness. Outside of the cave, clicking the \"There is something small and half-buried beside you\" will get you a hidden Potion, which can be used at any time from your INVENTORY to restore health. There are relatively few Potions in the game, however, so bear that in mind for your decision to use it. \\\\n\\\\nInside the cave, you can take the left or right fork. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 The right fork is a dead-end, but there is a 1 in 4 chance you\\\\\\'ll encounter a Northern Venomcat; this is the only place in the game a Northern Venomcat can be found, so go in and kill it if you\\\\\\'re going for 100% completion of the BESTIARY; it\\\\\\'ll also earn you a valuable Venomcat Pelt to sell later. \\\\n\\\\nTaking the left fork takes you deeper into the cave; there\\\\\\'s a small chance you\\\\\\'ll encounter a Spideer here. From here, going into the cavern will take you into the confrontation with Alcuin. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 If Marlowe is with you, he will warn you that you can\\\\\\'t take Alcuin in a fair fight. This is meant to be a hint. \\\\n\\\\nChoosing to fight will take you into a battle that is literally impossible to win, even with Marlow\\\\\\'s assistance. Choosing to flee will also get you killed if you are a mage or warrior. \\\\n\\\\nR Rogues can actually outrun Alcuin if you flee; you will be returned to the cave corridor outside of the cavern. \\\\n\\\\nTo defeat him, select \"the nearest pillar, cracked from years of decay\", and when Alcuin charges, you will trick him into smashing into it and collapsing it onto himself. \\\\n\\\\nPressing forward will take you into the Lich Battlemaster\\\\\\'s lair. Note that once you enter the deepest room and begin speaking with the Lich Battlemaster, you\\\\\\'ll have the option to end the conversation by leaving, however, as the game notes, you will be unable to return to that room to speak with her again. The conversation will end similarly no matter what, though answering with the more insulting \"Oh, come on...\" response will cause you to lose some favor with her. At the end, she\\\\\\'ll force you to decide between killing her and taking her as your companion. Killing her will grant you no XP, but you will get her sword, the Dracobane, which can be wielded if you\\\\\\'re a Warrior or sold at a decent price later. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 If you\\\\\\'re going for a complete bestiary, killing her here is the only way to get the Lich Battlemaster entry. \\\\n\\\\nAfter you either take her with you or kill her, you return to the cavernous room from before. Be sure to click on \"The dead demon Alcuin\" to get Alcuin\\\\\\'s Horn, which you can later sell. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 While examining Alcuin\\\\\\'s corpse, Marlowe will comment that he\\\\\\'s glad he came with you. If you are playing as the male character Alder, he will attempt to flirt with you, and you have the option of flirting back; doing so will raise both his romantic relationship count and his favor of you. \\\\n\\\\nAfter this, there\\\\\\'s nothing left to do here but return to the stream. \\\\n\\\\n-Following the stream will take you outside of the traveler\\\\\\'s camp. \\\\n\\\\n-From here, selecting \"A cluster of reeds...\" in the second paragraph will take you to a hidden area, Camber\\\\\\'s shop. If you bring him four Poison Antler Shards (obtained by killing Spideer), he\\\\\\'ll give you a useful weapon tailed to your class, each fairly powerful: Mages get the Phantom Spideer spell, rogues get the Spideer Hornbow, and Warriors get the sword Venompoint. Additionally, Camber will give you Vegetable Stew, which functionally serves as a Potion.\\\\n\\\\nBack outside, you can move forward, which will take you to the edge of the camp. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 There is a 1 in 4 chance here that you\\\\\\'ll encounter a Mud Lurker; as this is the only place where you\\\\\\'re guaranteed to encounter one, it\\\\\\'s worth re-entering until you fight it if you\\\\\\'re going for full completion. The Mud Lurker is tougher than other enemies you\\\\\\'ve encountered so far, so be cautious; it has a Poison weakness that can be exploited if you got the poison weapon/spell from Camber. When defeated, you\\\\\\'ll get either Mud Lurker Scales or a Mud Lurker Shell Fragment. \\\\n\\\\nAt the edge of camp, you have the option to enter the camp--going right inside will get you an instant game over, as you\\\\\\'ll be recognized and captured. Instead, click on \"a large tree\" in the second paragraph, which will cause you to hide behind the tree, listening to the nearby caravan guard. You\\\\\\'ll overhear his frightened, superstitious mumblings; take advantage of them by selecting \"a large tree branch\" in the first paragraph: you\\\\\\'ll use it prop up your cloak and scare the guard away. However, selecting \"the caravan nearest you\" will cause a game over, as the guard will spot you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x96 If the Lich Battlemaster is with you, you can alternatively simply ask her to go into the woods and spook the guard, which she will begrudgingly do. \\\\n\\\\nNow that it\\\\\\'s unguarded, you can sneak into the caravan. You can open all three chests at your leisure; the second has the Noble Clothes, which you should immediately equip from your Inventory, once you\\\\\\'ve returned outside. \\\\n\\\\nWith the clothes equipped, you can now enter the encampment--be sure to equip them first, as entering otherwise will still grant you a game over. You\\\\\\'ll be greeted by the pair of friends, Lord Montoire and Lady Aldana. You have to play the conversation right, or else you\\\\\\'ll make them suspicious and cause them to arrest you. \\\\n\\\\nIn the first part, answer Juniper rather than your character\\\\\\'s real name. In the second, either response will work; cracking the joke will cause them to laugh, and if you are playing as the female character Aspen, Lady Aldana will flirt with you. If you selected the response about \"Redcorrian ale\", you\\\\\\'ll be asked another question; choose the answer that mentions Tripel. After that, the conversation will be over, and you\\\\\\'re free to travel in/out of and around the camp. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the camp, selecting the cat (in the second paragraph) will take you to his shop, where you can sell and buy items; it is recommended that you sell whatever loot you have acquired here and use the money to upgrade your weapon or spells. Returning to the camp, you can speak to the guards, the cook, or the serving boy; all will be dead ends except for the cook, which will lead you to meet Daechiron. \\\\n\\\\nAfter speaking to Daechiron, you\\\\\\'ll have the option of taking him on as your companion; if you turn him down, you will not encounter him again. Whatever you choose, you can then start your journey to Eastern Hold, or stay here and keep preparing. If you haven\\\\\\'t been to the shop yet and planned to or wanted to grind for XP and loot more first, or had anything else you wanted to do in this section, do those first, as you cannot return to this area after embarking to the next part of the game. You\\\\\\'ll probably want a potion or two for the next segment of the game.\\\\n\\\\n---II. Eastern Hold---\\\\n\\\\nBy this point, you\\\\\\'ll have encountered all of the potential companions/taken one of them if you chose to. You can speak to them if you haven\\\\\\'t already to learn more about their backstories. You can have a deeper conversation with each three times, unless your approval is low, in which case they will refuse to speak with you. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x86 Eventually, with Daechiron, you\\\\\\'ll learn of his curse. This will start the side-quest to cure him. You\\\\\\'ll want to have spoken with him before you reach Eastridge. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 Similarly, if Marlowe reveals his past to you, you can later perform the side-quest to cure him. You\\\\\\'ll want to have spoken with him about this before you embark down the Eastern Road very far. Additionally, if your character is male, you\\\\\\'ll have another opportunity to flirt with Marlowe again to increase his romance score. \\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll begin the chapter on the Eastern Road, heading ultimately to Eastridge. You have the choice of sticking to the Main Road, which has three sections and somewhat easier foes, and an optional boss at the end, or the Hunter Trail, which has three sections of somewhat more difficult foes, with the boss at the end being non-optional. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x96\\\\xc2\\\\xb3 If you\\\\\\'re after full completion, both paths have the same percentage of chance to encounter the new enemies Hivernal Owl, Highwayman, and Doppelganger, but you\\\\\\'ll want to be sure to fight the Highwayman Leader boss, as he\\\\\\'s a unique enemy you can only encounter here, and additionally, he\\\\\\'ll yield the item Westbay Mead. The Westbay Mead can be sold for a very high price or consumed for a unique scene. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 If you have spoken to Marlowe about his curse and want to cure him, you\\\\\\'ll have to take the Hunter\\\\\\'s Trail. \\\\n\\\\nThis part may be tough, so don\\\\\\'t feel bad about needing to use a Potion at some point. The foes here can take a hit, so take advantage of your campanions\\\\\\' strength by letting them weaken the enemy a bit before finishing them off for the XP. If you took the main road, you\\\\\\'ll have the option of fighting the Highwayman Leader or sneaking past him; if you took the hunter\\\\\\'s trail, you\\\\\\'ll have to fight him. After defeating him or avoiding him, you can enter Tonnelle d\\\\\\'Ames. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 If you\\\\\\'ve unlocked Marlowe\\\\\\'s sidequest and he\\\\\\'s with you, at this point you can follow him into the woods to a cabin. Inside, you\\\\\\'ll fight the demon Astoriel, and get his phylactery in your inventory upon his defeat. You\\\\\\'ll need this later. \\\\n\\\\n-In Tonnelle d\\\\\\'Ames, you can pet the dog, which gives your character nothing but the joy of petting a dog, approach the Satyr, who runs a shop, or enter the inn. As always, it\\\\\\'s recommended that you sell unneeded loot and upgrade your weapons at the shop before moving on (you can also buy the Gossipy Pamphlet, which just gives provides more lore about the story). In the inn, you can speak to the harpies inside or pay 10 silver to rest and recover your health and MP/SP.\\\\n\\\\n-When you leave Tonnelle d\\\\\\'Ames, you\\\\\\'ll get on the road again, this time to Eastridge. Here, there\\\\\\'s only one path, with four sections; you\\\\\\'ll fight an enemy on each before reaching Eastridge, and the last is a miniboss, Great Bear. \\\\n\\\\nOnce in Eastridge, you can check out the library, the Cantrelle Estate, or the Lightkeeper Fort. \\\\n\\\\nM If you enter the library and you\\\\\\'re playing as a mage, you can explore the first floor for the very powerful spell Holy Griffon. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x86 If you\\\\\\'ve unlocked Daechiron\\\\\\'s quest, you can enter the library and follow his guidance, where he\\\\\\'ll lead you to a book that he will read. This is the necessary first step in the side-quest.\\\\n\\\\n-If you try to approach the LightKeeper fort, you\\\\\\'ll only be turned away, so you can go to the Cantrelle Estate. Here, you can talk to a young stableboy for information, but you want him to keep his guard down so he doesn\\\\\\'t alert the Cantrelles\\\\\\' guards. You generally want to avoid asking questions too directly here. Choosing the wrong option will lead to a game over. \\\\n\\\\nIn the first part, ask him what he does. Then, select \"I\\\\\\'m in the market for a good messenger...\" and after that say you need the \"fastest, best messengers\". The stablekid will tell you about the secret entrance at the Lightkeeper Fort that he delivers messages to, and you can now return to the fort. \\\\n\\\\n-Note: only return to the Lightkeeper Fort at this point if you\\\\\\'ve done everything you wanted to/bought what you needed from the shop, as the next sequence begins the end of this chapter, and you will be unable to return. Once you return to the Lightkeeper fort, you can follow the narrow passageway in back and sneak into the window. Inside, you can examine the plaque, spear, and plant if you want to, but do so first, as examining the desk papers will trigger the next part of the game, and Erimund will immediately return and chase you from the building. \\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll have to fight Erimund at the end; he has no weaknesses, but is immune to poison. After his defeat, you\\\\\\'ll Erimund\\\\\\'s Note in your inventory. Reading this note grants you the option of a secret dialogue choice that alters the first part of the final battle later. \\\\n\\\\nOnce you defeat Erimund, you\\\\\\'ll automatically move on to the next part of the game. \\\\n\\\\n---III. Southern Hold---\\\\n\\\\nThis is the final chapter of the game, and is the shortest with regard to exploration. \\\\n\\\\nYou begin on the road through Southern hold, deep in the Eternal Gloaming. There are new enemies to fight here, and the road has four sections, each with a fight, but no miniboss at the end. \\\\n\\\\nAt the end, you\\\\\\'ll emerge in the Elven city. From here, you can go to the August Palace, which will initiate the endgame. \\\\n\\\\nBefore that, you\\\\\\'ll probably want to select the cat, who runs a shop. As before, you can sell loot and upgrade your weapons or spells, which is highly recommended before the final boss; her items are the most expensive in the game, but powerful. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x86 If Daechiron is with you, if his sidequest has been unlocked, AND if you completed the first part in the libarary, purchasing Cironor\\\\\\'s Book from the cat will complete your portion of his sidequest.\\\\n\\\\n If you\\\\\\'re prepared, you can approach the August Palace, where your companion will comment that it\\\\\\'s all about to end. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 If Marlowe is your companion, this is the third and final opportunity to flirt with him. If you have done so all three times, his romance score will be at maximum for the final events. \\\\n\\\\n Inside the palace, you\\\\\\'ll find the big party. You can examine the skeletal dragon in the room, talk to the serving elf, talk to the blonde woman nearby, or examine the ossifrage--be advised that doing this last will engage the endgame. \\\\n\\\\n Examining the ossifrage will cause Lady Cantrelle to take note of you; either option will cause the party to fall silent. From here, if you read Erimund\\\\\\'s Note, you\\\\\\'ll have a special option that will cause Lizbeth to give up, and the ossifrage will kill her. If you choose this option, the ensuing fight will be a little easier, as it will be against the ossifrage alone. \\\\n\\\\n If you don\\\\\\'t have that option or choose the other, you\\\\\\'ll fight the ossifrage with Lizbeth helping it. The difference is only slight; if Lizbeth is aiding it, they will have the additional move \"Lizbeth\\\\\\'s knife\", which does the most damage of all its attacks. \\\\n\\\\n After defeating the ossifrage, it will reveal its true form as the demon Nerva, and will possess the dragon skeleton for the true final boss fight. \\\\n\\\\n In both ossifrage and skeletal dragon form, Nerva has no weaknesses, but he also has no immunities, so all of your strongest attacks are fair game, and you\\\\\\'ll definitely want your companion\\\\\\'s aid every turn. \\\\n\\\\n Once you defeat him, as Nerva dies, he will make his final act an attempt to crush you with the dragon\\\\\\'s skull. This will end one of several ways. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x86 If you completed all parts of Daechiron\\\\\\'s sidequest, he will revert to his true form and effortlessly stop the skull with magic. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x98\\\\xc2\\\\x96 If your companion is the Lich Battlemaster, she will jump in front of you to try to stop the skull, and will be crushed in the process. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x99\\\\xc2\\\\x88 If Marlowe is your companion:\\\\n\\\\n -If your romance count with Marlowe is at its maximum, he will deflect the skull and survive. If you have Astoriel\\\\\\'s phylactery, he will then break it and end his curse. \\\\n\\\\n -Otherwise, he will be mortally wounded by the skull after taking the hit for you, and he will die there. \\\\n\\\\n -If your romance count is not at maximum and you have completed his sidequest, his dying request will be for you to break Astoriel\\\\\\'s phylactery, and he\\\\\\'ll die with the curse lifted. \\\\n\\\\n If you have no companion, you will be partly crushed by the skull, and will pass out on the floor. You\\\\\\'ll wake in a bed, with the elven king and your father present. \\\\n\\\\n Otherwise, your father will approach you at the party. Your decision with regard to him marks your last decision in the game. After this, the story will conclude. \\\\n\\\\n ---V. Bestiary/Enemy Guide---\\\\n\\\\nBelow is an in-depth guide to the enemies that can be encountered in-game. The blurb, weakness, and immunity can be also found in the in-game bestiary once defeated, along with the number you have killed. In the \"known moves\" section, the damage power of each move is listed by its name in parentheses.\\\\n\\\\n-Spideer \\\\nweakness: fire\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\nHP: 10\\\\nknown moves: Venomed Antler (5), Stomp (3)\\\\nloot: Poison Antler Shard\\\\nencounter: random, Lornely Forest and Eastern Hold\\\\nblurb: Eight legs, two antlers, no mercy.\\\\n\\\\n-Restless Ghost\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\nHP: 15\\\\nknown moves: Rending Shriek (5), Dark Pulse (3), Shade\\\\\\'s Wrath (3)\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Forest\\\\nblurb: They wander empty forests, not knowing or remembering what they are, driven by unending pain.\\\\n\\\\n-Northern Venomcat\\\\nweakness: spirit\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\nHP: 12\\\\nknown moves: Poison Fang (5), Crush of Fangs (3), Claw-tipped Swipe (3)\\\\nloot: Venomcat Pelt\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Cave\\\\nblurb: A predator of light build and dark blue, spotted fur. Its incisors carry venom, as the name suggests. Its closest relative, the Southdales Venomcat, was prized for its fur and hunted to extinction...but in the wilds of the Northern Hold, the venomcat roams free...and feared.\\\\n\\\\n-Mud Lurker\\\\nweakness: poison\\\\nimmunity: fire\\\\nHP: 20\\\\nknown moves: Bite (7), Full-body Slam (10), Tail Strike (6)\\\\nloot: Mud Lurker Shell Fragment, Mud Lurker Scales\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Forest and Eastern Hold\\\\nblurb: A large reptile native to freshwater streams; an extant ancestor to turtles, which serve as its meals as often as riverfish. To see what makes it markedly more dangerous than a turtle, one need only look at its more saurian head, lined with needle-sharp teeth.\\\\n\\\\n-Doppelg\\\\xc3\\\\x83\\\\xc2\\\\xa4nger\\\\nweakness: ice\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\nHP: 25\\\\nknown moves: {incomprehensible attack} (10), {incomprehensible attack} (7), {incomprehensible attack} (6)\\\\nloot: Rusted Relic\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold and Southern Hold\\\\nblurb: Whatever these things truly are, they appear in dark places, such as moonless forests or unlit corners of buildings. Its physical appearance is exactly that of the person who encounters it, except with a permanent, placid smile, and they never utter a sound. When killed, they disappear, strangely leaving behind old battle relics.\\\\n\\\\n-Hivernal Owl\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\nimmunity: ice\\\\nHP: 25\\\\nknown moves: Icewind (9), Talon Rake (5), Freezing Bite (6)\\\\nloot: White Feather\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold\\\\nblurb: A large breed of owl native to the rainy fields and forests of the Tonnelle d\\\\\\'\\\\xc3\\\\x83\\\\xc2\\\\xa2mes, and sometimes encountered in surrounding areas. As much a natural predator as any owl, the Hivernal has evolved to use a primitive form of ice magic to slow or freeze its prey. It is the subject of much old poetry throughout Eastern Hold. \\\\n\\\\n-Highwayman\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 25\\\\nknown moves: Rally (12), Swift Strike (6), Reckless Blow (8)\\\\nloot: Silver Charm\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold\\\\nblurb: An Eastern Hold bandit prone to ambushing vulnerable travelers on dark roads. While the Southern Hold bandits tend to represent organized crime and are made of xenophobic humans, in Eastern Hold, a bandit gang is typically a small group of humans and satyrs.\\\\n\\\\n-Highwayman Leader\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 35\\\\nknown moves: Brutal Swing (10), Swift Strike (7), Reckless Strike (7)\\\\nloot: Westbay Mead\\\\nencounter: fixed, Eastern Hold main road\\\\nblurb: A highwayman...but, like, the leader.\\\\n\\\\n-Sundog\\\\nweakness: electric\\\\nimmunity: fire\\\\nHP: 35\\\\nknown moves: Flamejet (12), Burning Bite (8), Claw Swipe (6)\\\\nloot: Sundog Tooth\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\nblurb: A wild canine of striking orange coat, white chest, and black legs. Its firebreathing was long a mystery to mages, as it gives off no magical aura: elven researchers recently discovered the sundog\\\\\\'s ability comes from gas released from a special organ, ignited in the sundog\\\\\\'s maw by a click of specialized flint-like back teeth.\\\\n\\\\n-Renegade Bloodmage\\\\nweakness: ice\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\nHP: 35\\\\nknown moves: Mindbend (12), Summon Lesser Demon (9), Spirit Bolt (9)\\\\nloot: Bloodmage Phylactery\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\nblurb: While some forms of magic are outlawed universally in all four holds of Eritan, laws will always have breakers. With these eldritch sadists around, it\\\\\\'s easy to see why a fear of mages is not uncommon.\\\\n\\\\n-Demon Astoriel\\\\nweakness: electric\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 40\\\\nknown moves: Arcane Terror (10), Forbidden Fire Rune (7), Arcstorm (7)\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\nencounter: fixed, Marlowe quest\\\\nblurb: A relatively minor demon, and one particularly fond of wandering amid mortals, disguised as one of them. While other demons tend to remain a bit more aloof, Astoriel\\\\\\'s fascination with mortal drives led him to interact with them often, to better observe their behavior...and make things more insteresting as he saw fit. This tendency came back to bite him, as you killed him to free Marlowe\\\\\\'s soul.\\\\n\\\\n-Great Bear\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\nimmunity: ice\\\\nHP: 30\\\\nknown moves: Maul (12), Bellowing Charge (7), Massive Swipe (7)\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\nencounter: fixed, east road just before Eastridge-by-the-Sea\\\\nblurb: A very large and very territorial bear, with an immensely thick brown coat that helps to cushion it from blows. \\\\n\\\\n-Balaur\\\\nweakness: spirit\\\\nimmunity: electric\\\\nHP: 35 \\\\nknown moves: Electric Slam (10), Swift Fang (10), Winged Dive (10)\\\\nloot: Balaur Heart\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\nblurb: A horse-sized flying reptile. As the only extant relative of the feared and revered dragon, it shares dragons\\\\\\' affinity for magic (preferring electricity to the dragon\\\\\\'s fire). Though they lack dragons\\\\\\' sentience, they have been shown to have some primitive intellect of their own and the beginnings of what could be considered culture. Curiously, they are social beings, unlike dragons.\\\\n\\\\nNOTE: the following don\\\\\\'t have Bestiary entries, but are fought nonetheless. \\\\n\\\\n-Knight-Paladin Erimund\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\nHP: 50\\\\nknown moves: Shining Arrow (10), Holy Fire (7), Blinding Volley (7)\\\\nloot: Erimund\\\\\\'s Note\\\\nencounter: fixed, Eastern Hold boss\\\\n\\\\n-Demon Nerva\\\\nOssifrage form, with Lizbeth:\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 55\\\\nknown moves: Lizbeth\\\\\\'s Knife (12), Crushing Beak (5), Bonebreaking Wings (5)\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\n\\\\nOssifrage form, without Lizbeth:\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 50\\\\nknown moves: Razer Talons (5), Crushing Beak (7), Bonebreaking Wings (7)\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\x83\\\\xc2\\\\x81SVALDR form:\\\\nweakness: none\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\nHP: 75\\\\nknown moves: Fireball (15), Lashing Tail (9), Crushing Jaws (9)\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\n\\\\nNOTE: (If encountered) Demon Alcuin and (if killed) Lich Battlemaster have Bestiary entries, but as they are not actually fought, they are not listed here. \\\\n\\\\n---vi.

Best handle with care...\\\\n\\\\n-Venomcat Pelt\\\\nobtained:\\\\nfunction:\\\\ndesc: A fine, soft pelt of a Northern Venomcat. Its deep blue hue is subtly accented with darker spots. Clothing of this stuff would make for fashionable attire. Probably.\\\\n\\\\n-Vegetable Stew\\\\nobtained: Camber, after bringing antler shards\\\\nfunction: healing\\\\ndesc: A delicious-smelling stew of herbs and roast vegetables, carefully packaged to the brim into a glass jar. Eating it will fully restore your HP and [SP/MP].\\\\n\\\\n-Mud Lurker Scales\\\\nobtained: loot from Mud Lurker\\\\nfunction: sell\\\\ndesc: Scales from a Mud Lurker; they are cool to the touch, shiny, and deep green in color.\\\\n\\\\n-Mud Lurker Shell Fragment\\\\nobtained: loot from Mud Lurker\\\\nfunction: sell\\\\ndesc: A piece of a Mud Lurker\\\\\\'s bony shell. It\\\\\\'s slick to the touch, and remarkably hard.\\\\n\\\\n-Rusted Relic\\\\nobtained: loot from Doppelganger\\\\nfunction: sell\\\\ndesc: A very ancient sword. It\\\\\\'s in too poor of a shape to be of any use as your weapon, but it would likely fetch a decent price to a collector.\\\\n\\\\n-White Feather\\\\nobtained: loot from Hivernal Owl\\\\nfunction: sell\\\\ndesc: A long flight feather from a Hivernal Owl. \\\\n\\\\n-Silver Charm\\\\nobtained: loot from Highwayman\\\\nfunction: sell\\\\ndesc: A small silver pendant engraven with the image of Mendolas, a demon of old tales, associated with luck, and patron deity to many bandits. It hangs on a small, well-crafted silver chain.

You could sell it for a very high price.

It\\\\\\'s Rosalind\\\\\\'s birthday, but her\\\\nmother is distraught and either hasn\\\\\\'t remembered or isn\\\\\\'t paying\\\\nattention to her. So, Rosalind decides to visit her grandmother who\\\\nlives in the forest. To prepare for the journey, we\\\\\\'ll need all of\\\\ngrandmother\\\\\\'s supplies (everything that\\\\\\'s on the table: the wine, the\\\\nbread, and the jar of honey), plus our red cape:\\\\n\\\\n> take everything from the table\\\\n> open the chest\\\\n> take the cape\\\\n> wear the cape\\\\n\\\\nBefore we go, though, some insight to the story can be gained from\\\\ntrying to talk to Rosalind\\\\\\'s mother:\\\\n\\\\n> north\\\\n\\\\nThen, it\\\\\\'s out the door and on to grandmother\\\\\\'s house:\\\\n\\\\n> out\\\\n> south\\\\n> southwest\\\\n\\\\nUpon entering the woods, we meet a wolf (press any key to advance\\\\nthrough the cut scene). He leads us somewhat astray, but Rosalind is\\\\nbecoming a resourceful young woman, and we soon finds our way back to\\\\nthe path:\\\\n\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\n\\\\nThis puts us at the covered bridge and the edge of the Black Forest. Now\\\\nthat we\\\\\\'ve reached the forest, many options are possible. For the\\\\npursposes of this walkthrough, we\\\\\\'ll go first to grandmother\\\\\\'s house (to\\\\nretreive her locket). It isn\\\\\\'t far:\\\\n\\\\n> north\\\\n> northwest\\\\n> north\\\\n> north\\\\n\\\\nSomething seems amiss here in grandmother\\\\\\'s living room, and having a\\\\ngood look around may be in order. We\\\\\\'re after the locket, which is up in\\\\nthe attic crawlspace, which we can access via the kitchen:\\\\n\\\\n> west\\\\n\\\\nBefore going up the the attic, note the cellar door:\\\\n\\\\n> open the cellar door\\\\n\\\\n(More on that later.) In the meantime, let\\\\\\'s proceed to the attic:\\\\n\\\\n> up\\\\n> examine the glint\\\\n> take the locket\\\\n> wear the locket\\\\n\\\\nNow that we have grandmother\\\\\\'s locket, other important parts of the game\\\\nwill become available. There\\\\\\'s one challenge though:\\\\n\\\\n> open the locket\\\\n\\\\nThe locket won\\\\\\'t cooperate with this, at least not yet. A hint about\\\\nthis can be found by stepping out into the woods and trying again:\\\\n\\\\n> down\\\\n> east\\\\n> south\\\\n> open the locket\\\\n\\\\nTo open the locket, we need to get out from under the canopy of the\\\\nforest (and into the center of the lake):\\\\n\\\\n> south\\\\n> east\\\\n> east\\\\n\\\\nTo properly get out from under the canopy, we\\\\\\'ll need to get into the\\\\ncenter of the lake, by boat:\\\\n\\\\n> pull the chain\\\\n> enter the boat\\\\n\\\\nUnder the unfiltered moonlight, we can:\\\\n\\\\n> open the locket\\\\n\\\\nThis action activates the magical powers of the locket, prompting a\\\\nvariety of visions and remembrances throughout the rest of the game. To\\\\nget back in to shore, we:\\\\n\\\\n> pull the chain\\\\n\\\\nThere were some parts of grandmother\\\\\\'s house left unexplored, so let\\\\\\'s\\\\nreturn there (to collect the walking stick and the monocle, among other\\\\nthings). On the way we\\\\\\'ll make a detour so that we can have some light\\\\nin the basement. To make all this possible, we\\\\\\'ll need to re-purpose the\\\\njar of honey.\\\\n\\\\n> open the jar\\\\n> wash the jar\\\\n\\\\nThen, we\\\\\\'ll make ourselves a lantern:\\\\n\\\\n> west\\\\n> catch some fireflies\\\\n\\\\nNow back to grandmother\\\\\\'s house for some snooping around her side yard.\\\\n\\\\n> west\\\\n> north (*this action will trigger a vision)\\\\n> west\\\\n\\\\nIn the side yard, there\\\\\\'s grandmother\\\\\\'s woodpile and the hatchet she\\\\nuses to trim her firewood.\\\\n\\\\n> take the hatchet\\\\n> examine the woodpile\\\\n\\\\nSomeone\\\\\\'s been digging through the woodpile. Perhaps you should as well:\\\\n\\\\n> search the woodpile\\\\n\\\\nYou find an unusual log, which bears a closer look:\\\\n\\\\n> examine the log (* this action will trigger a vision)\\\\n\\\\nThe other major attraction in the side yard is the old well:\\\\n\\\\n> examine the well\\\\n> examine the bucket\\\\n\\\\nRecall that the cellar door was locked. This is out alternative route\\\\nunderground, where we find some important items, and return to the\\\\nkitchen:\\\\n\\\\n> enter the bucket\\\\n> take the key\\\\n> north\\\\n> take the glass fragment\\\\n> examine it (*)\\\\n> east\\\\n> east [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNLOCKING]\\\\n\\\\nNow let\\\\\\'s return to the living room (to collect the gloves and the\\\\npebbles):\\\\n\\\\n> east\\\\n> examine the quilt\\\\n> take it\\\\n> look\\\\n\\\\nDisturbing the quilt uncovers the gloves, which will come in handy later\\\\n(the quilt itself is unnecessary).\\\\n\\\\n> drop the quilt\\\\n> take the gloves\\\\n> examine them\\\\n\\\\nThe other important item here is the grandfather clock:\\\\n\\\\n> examine the clock\\\\n> open it\\\\n\\\\nTo open the clock, recall a specific detail from the vision:\\\\n\\\\n> concentrate on the locket (*)\\\\n> set the time to 2:35\\\\n\\\\nInside the clock, we find a boy\\\\\\'s hunting jacket. The jacket itself is\\\\nless important than the contents of its pockets:\\\\n\\\\n> search jacket\\\\n> examine the pebbles\\\\n> south\\\\n> examine the pebbles (*)\\\\n\\\\nMoon-Shaped is clearly based on the Grimm Brothers\\\\\\' tale of Little Red\\\\nRiding Hood... but it may be at this point that another tale begins to\\\\ncome to mind (if it hasn\\\\\\'t already). Anyhow, those pebbles sure are\\\\nshiny -- just watch:\\\\n\\\\n> out\\\\n\\\\nNow that we\\\\\\'ve begun to notice them, we can spot those shiny pebbles in\\\\nplaces we hadn\\\\\\'t noticed before! They form a path which we can follow\\\\n(to visit the burned ground and collect the candies):\\\\n\\\\n> southeast (*)\\\\n> east\\\\n> northeast\\\\n> northwest\\\\n> northeast (*)\\\\n\\\\nThis creepy patch of burned ground has past significance (which is\\\\nrevealed explicitly if the old woman\\\\\\'s monocle has already been\\\\ndiscovered):\\\\n\\\\n> look\\\\n> concentrate on the monocle (*)\\\\n\\\\nWhen the old woman wore the monocle, she moved as though was was\\\\navoiding \"invisible obstacles\". Wearing the monocle will grant us a\\\\nsimilar ability:\\\\n\\\\n> wear the monocle\\\\n\\\\nUh-oh. The orange candies inside the cage are mesmerizing. If we try a\\\\ncouple of different things while we\\\\\\'re transfixed, a few hints will be\\\\nrevealed about how to free us from the candy\\\\\\'s spell:\\\\n\\\\n> blink\\\\n> eat the bread\\\\n\\\\nNow, let\\\\\\'s try that again:\\\\n\\\\n> wear monocle\\\\n> examine the cage\\\\n> take the candies\\\\n\\\\nWe can\\\\\\'t reach the candies, at least not with our arms:\\\\n\\\\n> push the candies with the walking stick\\\\n> take candies\\\\n> examine them (*)\\\\n\\\\nThe pieces are coming together, but there\\\\\\'s one area that we haven\\\\\\'t\\\\nexplored completely yet. We\\\\\\'ll go there to collect the dagger, crush the\\\\ncandies, and learn the details of the curse (which will kick off the\\\\nendgame):\\\\n\\\\n> remove the monocle\\\\n> southwest\\\\n> west\\\\n> north (*)\\\\n\\\\nThe cave entrance is blocked:\\\\n\\\\n> north\\\\n\\\\nBut the vision we saw upon arriving indicates that the walking stick\\\\nwill be helpful:\\\\n\\\\n> swing the walking stick\\\\n> north\\\\n> down\\\\n\\\\nThere are several things of note in the cavern. First the inscriptions,\\\\nwhich are un-readable without the aid of the monocle:\\\\n\\\\n> examine the inscriptions\\\\n> wear the monocle\\\\n> examine the inscriptions\\\\n> remove the monocle\\\\n\\\\nOnce we have taken the candies and read the inscriptions, things can\\\\nprogress rapidly towards the endgame. A few final visions will \"barge\\\\nin\" during the next few rounds. The first of these visions gives a hint\\\\nabout where to go next (the waterfall).\\\\n\\\\nBut first: note that the inscriptions mention a bit about \"sweet\\\\ntemptation\" and show an image of snow or powder sprinking down onto a\\\\nskull. To make some sweet powder, we\\\\\\'ll use the mortar and pestle here:\\\\n\\\\n> take the pestle\\\\n> put the candies into the mortar\\\\n> crush them with the pestle\\\\n> take the powder\\\\n> put the pestle into the mortar\\\\n\\\\nAlso note the tin box:\\\\n\\\\n> open the box\\\\n> take the dagger\\\\n\\\\nOuch! The silver allergy was also mentioned in the inscriptions, but\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t worry. We\\\\\\'re prepared:\\\\n\\\\n> wear the gloves\\\\n\\\\nAlthough you might have to do some inventory management, depending on\\\\nwhat\\\\\\'s in your hands at the time (the walking stick, for example, is\\\\ndirty and would ruin grandmother\\\\\\'s gloves). Once you\\\\\\'re wearing the\\\\ngloves, you can:\\\\n\\\\n> take the dagger\\\\n\\\\nThen, it\\\\\\'s off the the waterfall (and the endgame):\\\\n\\\\n> up\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n> southwest\\\\n> southwest\\\\n> down (*)\\\\n\\\\nIf you had visited the bottom of the waterfall before, it was a dead\\\\nend. However, by this point you\\\\\\'re more attuned to your surroundings.\\\\nNote: from here, there will be no turning back -- this would be a good\\\\ntime to save the game!\\\\n\\\\n> north\\\\n\\\\nThere are two graves in this clearing (one for Rosalind\\\\\\'s uncle Hansel\\\\nand one for her brother Rainer), along with the wolf (her father) with\\\\ngrandmother (who was swallowed whole) in his belly. According the the\\\\ninscriptions, we\\\\\\'re in search of the bones of the first cursed person in\\\\nthe family to die. That\\\\\\'s uncle Hansel, and to access his bones:\\\\n\\\\n> open the wooden grave\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFrom here, there are eight final outcomes possible. The endings have\\\\nvarying levels of \"success\" depending on whether you and your family\\\\nmembers survive the next few rounds and whether you\\\\\\'re able to lift the\\\\ncurse. There are several actions that can be undertaken in a variety of\\\\ncombinations:\\\\n\\\\n-- Attacking the wolf with the hatchet will free grandmother from the\\\\nwolf\\\\\\'s belly without killing him.\\\\n\\\\n-- Attacking the wolf with the silver dagger will kill him (and\\\\ngrandmother, too, if she\\\\\\'s still trapped in his belly).\\\\n\\\\n-- Sprinkling the powder onto Uncle Hansel\\\\\\'s bones will lift the curse\\\\nand turn the wolf back into your father. (This action will kill\\\\ngrandmother if she\\\\\\'s in the wolf\\\\\\'s belly at the time.)\\\\n\\\\n-- Going south will be considered an attempt to run away. (You\\\\\\'ll be\\\\ngiven two opportunities to reconsider because this choice will always\\\\nend badly.)\\\\n\\\\nHere are the eight combinations that will end the game:\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #1 ---\\\\nThis is the best possible ending, in which Rosalind, grandmother, and\\\\nfather all survive and are free from the curse.\\\\n\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #2 ---\\\\nRosalind and grandmother survive and are free from the curse, but the\\\\nwolf (your father) dies:\\\\n\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\n> attack the wolf with the silver dagger\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #3 ---\\\\nRosalind and father survive and are free from the curse, but grandmother\\\\ndies:\\\\n\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #4 ---\\\\nRosalind survives and is free from the curse, but father and grandmother\\\\nboth die:\\\\n\\\\n> attack wolf with the silver dagger\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #5 ---\\\\nRosalind and grandmother survive but remain cursed. The wolf (your\\\\nfather) dies:\\\\n\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\n> attack the wolf with the silver dagger\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #6 ---\\\\nRosalind survives but remains cursed. Grandmother and the wolf both die:\\\\n\\\\n> attack the wolf with the silver dagger\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #7 ---\\\\nRosalind dies. Grandmother survives, but remains cursed:\\\\n\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n> south\\\\n\\\\n--- Ending #8 ---\\\\nRosalind and grandmother both die.

Secondary objects are killing off a warrior, werewolf, vampire and wolf... as well as sleeping with a sexy blonde maid for added measure of \"conquest\". (j/k) \\\\n\\\\nThere are a few major bugs with Bob Sorem\\\\\\'s port... the murder weapon is not always what is described in the text of the game.  For example, on Mystery #1 - in-game the murder weapon was said to be the \"AXE\", but I had to bring the CLUB to the murder scene.   In the James Garnett ver 19.4, that is all fixed... but in his port I could not save the game at all - it didn\\\\\\'t restore correctly even with SUSPEND/LOAD commands.  So I definitely preferred the SOREM version for playing with its nice save system... but you MUST be aware of that bug.  Solving the case really is as simple as walking into the correct location with both the murderer and the murder weapon.  (and then you can walk to the phone to \"Call Police\")\\\\n\\\\nALSO... Magic works differently in the SOREM port then it does in the Garnett version.

Having done that and previously survived all hazards, confronted the murderer and turned him/her over to the police and still had time to take a shower and a restful sleep on the maids bed (I have been able to get all the available treasure quickly enough to need to sleep for a couple of hours before the game ends), you should score well over 900 points.\\\\n\\\\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\\\nSCORE RANKINGS & POINTS:\\\\nPITIFUL Sleuth (0-85)\\\\nPOOR Sleuth  (85-170)\\\\nUNLUCKY (171-254)\\\\nNOVICE  (255-340)\\\\nFAIR   (341-425)\\\\nAMATEUR (426-510)\\\\nGOOD  (511-595)\\\\nLUCKY (596-680)\\\\nSKILLFUL (681-765)\\\\nSUPERB (766-850)\\\\nMASTER (851-930)\\\\nSUPER (931+ )\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n===============================================\\\\nEXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH WITH POINT TOTALS:\\\\n===============================================\\\\nRemember:  \"score points\" (+2 -

I would agree that it was quite ambitious for its time, and also a pretty steep challenge.  Not only is the battery in the lamp greatly underpowered, but you have also have the ticking time bomb of the daylight hours, and the eventual end game to deal with.  I never made it to the end of the game with any light intact, other than a last ditch match to light my last candle to escape the cluthes of the burning down Mansion.\\\\n\\\\nA few brief comments about ports...  even with the SUSPEND feature, I could not actually save a game properly on the James Garnett port.  Not sure if its just new versions of windows vs. old versions or what... but everytime I tried to restore I ended up back at the Main Gate without being able to move anywhere.  So I had to play Sorem\\\\\\'s port instead, which has a terrific save game feature with save slots.  One thing to watch out for (if anybody is reading this blog in search of tips like I was)...   MAGIC works quite differently in the two ports.  Sorem\\\\\\'s port you can divine all four magic words in the garden, while Garnett\\\\\\'s port seems to have two \"fixed\" words (they are the same everytime).  \\\\n\\\\nOne other possible major bug in the Sorem port is that sometimes the in-game description tells you the wrong murder weapon!  I was trying everything to accuse the Butler with the Axe (the game said so)... but I looked up the same mystery on the Garnett port and the murder weapon was the CLUB.  When I brought the club to the crime scene... the game proudly announced I\\\\\\'d solved the case.\\\\n\\\\nA few things I discovered in addition to the tips listed here that might help:\\\\n\\\\n- Gold Coins = I too never discovered them, but the source code alludes to digging?  If anybody wants to dig all over the game world, let me know what you find.\\\\n\\\\n- The Maid = Yes, she\\\\\\'s particular.  There are actually FIVE criteria that have to be met, and solving the crime isn\\\\\\'t one of them.   This happens in the Maid\\\\\\'s Room:\\\\n1. There are no other people around (just you and her)\\\\n2. The door is closed & locked\\\\n3. There is no light in the room\\\\n4. You\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re freshly showered.\\\\n5. You\\\\\\'re carrying nothing!  (so don\\\\\\'t forget to \"Drop Clothes\" too...  that sounded funny)\\\\n  and one caveat about your timing in this, *ahem, endeavour...  if you can\\\\\\'t OPEN CURTAIN and have light come in... you have no way to escape the room.  You are locked in, can\\\\\\'t pickup anything in the dark, and can\\\\\\'t turn on any lights!!   The seductress has ensnared you in her devious trap!\\\\n\\\\n- The Taxi = is actually not available after you solve the crime.  Solving the crime does allow you to call the police, but calling for a Taxi seems to occur only late in the game.  Certainly after the explosion, but probably sometime after a particular time on the clock it would work as well.  (Maybe 10 or 11?)\\\\n\\\\nFascinating game overall.  Truly challenging... even trying to optimize the walkthrough to allow for points had me checking score at almost every step to figure out where the points were scored, and trying desperately to do as much as possible without that lantern on.  Dude, next time bring some duracells!  I eventually scored 979 pts, so I think 999 is maybe... possibly...  possible.  But you can only carry so much over the finish line.  In any case, I wrote up a solution/FAQ guide which I hope to posted over at the interactive fiction archives soon.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for your postings and the introduction to this game.  I had no knowledge of this growing up, jumped more into the likes of Zork & Adventureland.  \\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\"Walkthrough for Necrotic Drift\\\\n\\\\nSo, we\\\\\\'re in New Haz again, on a different outing. How different? It\\\\\\'s a\\\\nbit like comparing The World\\\\\\'s End to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in\\\\nthe Blood and Ice-cream Trilogy: Necrotic Drift\\\\\\'s setting and focus are\\\\nmore linear and narrow than Fallacy of Dawn, but with a darker, more\\\\nmature plot and characters. I may make another reference to these films\\\\nlater, but I\\\\\\'ll keep it to one.\\\\n\\\\nChapter One: Duffy\\\\nOur intro is to a nice guy named Duffy, his love of D&D and one of the\\\\nfew times he and his dad were best friends as well as family. Today\\\\nhowever, he\\\\\\'s rolling his Dodge stat against video rental fees by going\\\\nto Academy Videos in New Haz so he can have a movie night with his\\\\non/off girlfriend Audrey. Trying to prove a point about The Lord of the\\\\nRings can lead to danger, it seems.\\\\nYou don\\\\\\'t \\\\\\'need\\\\\\' to talk to Gibs or your room-mates in this number-based\\\\ndialogue system, but there\\\\\\'s a nice bit of flavor.\\\\nGibs is your best mate and chatting to him goes a little bit more into\\\\nyour problems with Audrey (any number), and why your room-mates should\\\\nnot be around if you want a movie night with her (if you picked 3).\\\\nTalking to him again after he mentions his plans for tonight offers some\\\\nforeshadowing.\\\\nTalking to both of your room-mates gives you an idea of why they\\\\nprobably shouldn\\\\\\'t be your room-mates.\\\\nX Clerk if you like- Adrian Bates hasn\\\\\\'t changed a bit, not even his\\\\nprofile photo. \\\\nX DVDs. You can also X the genres to get an idea of Duffy\\\\\\'s personal\\\\ntaste.\\\\nTake DVD- no need to specify as Duffy automatically takes The Lord of\\\\nthe Rings. \\\\nYou can also TAKE NAIL GUN when the clerk tells all of you to hurry up\\\\nfor sleazy reasons, as he places it on the counter. He doesn\\\\\\'t notice\\\\nyou nicking it, so it looks like he really wants that massage...\\\\nSoon enough it begins. Some creature lurks its way into the store. The\\\\nclerk thinks it\\\\\\'s a tramp and shows his caring attitude from the last\\\\ngame. Everyone else thinks it\\\\\\'s a bot, but bots other than Failed Romero\\\\nnormally don\\\\\\'t attack people- not even rude video store staff.\\\\nI normally ATTACK THING and save the clerk, but as long as you deal with\\\\nit before it starts on you. In fact, if you let it knock the clerk out,\\\\nGibs encourages you to go get the nail-gun- which you may not have\\\\nnoticed before because you weren\\\\\\'t reading closely enough (oops).\\\\nSo, no need to pay to hire LOtR. Let\\\\\\'s go home. E.\\\\n\\\\nYou can X your car all you want, you can\\\\\\'t realise that the bot\\\\\\'s\\\\nclimbed into your car until you try to \\\\\\'enter car\\\\\\'. Cheeky bastard knows\\\\nto hide on the car floor.\\\\nAttack thing again until it drops.\\\\nEnter car.\\\\nDrive.\\\\n\\\\nChapter Two: Audrey\\\\nOnto your date with Audrey! In your living room, with two troublesome\\\\nhousemates...This is definitely the part that reminded me a little of\\\\nShaun of the Dead, so this is a problem that many people are having\\\\ntoday, especially since many people can\\\\\\'t move out. This chapter is\\\\nfairly dialogue-driven, and your choices matter more in the banter you\\\\nread next. You can skip to the next chapter in this walkthrough if you\\\\nlike.\\\\nThe Duffster shares the story of his one big win that lead to his car, a\\\\nless limited wardrobe and his relationship: a D&D tournament that was\\\\nwon through being a skilled and kind player...five years ago.\\\\n \\\\nT Pang. Unfortunately, no matter which number you pick he won\\\\\\'t bugger\\\\noff. When you hear the knock on the door, OPEN DOOR to let Audrey in.\\\\nYou can talk to your housemates as they argue over what DVD they\\\\\\'re\\\\nwatching, but you can\\\\\\'t change how they behave.\\\\nYou can give your housemates a serve for ruining your date and being\\\\nrude to your girlfriend. T Pang, T Criswell in that order if you want to\\\\ndo both.\\\\nN to go to your room and face the music. \\\\nT Audrey.\\\\nRather than her talk being a generic bitch about your housemates and a\\\\nnasty screech blaming you for it, Audrey is concerned about you. She\\\\nbelieves you deserve and can make a happier life for yourself, and that\\\\nyou two are falling into a rut instead of enjoying life. Looks like\\\\nshe\\\\\\'s grown from once dumping Duffy for someone trying to buy his\\\\nfuneral plot early- then dumping him for failing. You don\\\\\\'t have to\\\\nagree, but repeat T Audrey and choose numbers to keep the conversation\\\\ngoing. \\\\nShe\\\\\\'s also moving to Texas and wants you there with her, but you\\\\\\'re not\\\\nkeen on it. When you tell her this, she\\\\\\'s a bit miffed and begins trying\\\\nto convince you.\\\\nYour only option is to say you have work. Not exactly a lie, but you\\\\\\'ll\\\\nbe starting early. Audrey agrees to talk more about Texas later and you\\\\nleave on uneasy-but-happy terms. \\\\nS to get ready to leave.\\\\nYou have nothing to say to anyone now. Let\\\\\\'s go to work. OUT.\\\\n\\\\nChapter 3: Corporate Fret\\\\nTalk to Trott, read the postcard to learn a little about Delarion Yar\\\\\\'s\\\\nhappy ending.\\\\nTalk to Gibbs when he arrives, and do the same for Audrey when she shows\\\\nup.\\\\nAudrey wants to talk to you, but the request is more mundane: can you\\\\nhelp her friends working at the Bead Store with their register computer?\\\\nTry talking to the girls as they set up their ill-advised ritual. X\\\\nregister. A cable appears to be causing the problem for the PC. Ooh, a\\\\npretty crystal ball holder. Take Holder.\\\\nTake cable. \\\\nTo get back to it more quickly, STAND UP. Everyone is fine, Casey even\\\\nseems a bit too happy that the lights have blown. Sydney may need help.\\\\nX her...\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\'s not Sydney. The Not-Sydney has weird demon eyes, is floating\\\\nand has now summoned a...\\\\n\\\\nSkeleton: Duffy knows that skeletons, if they are like role-playing\\\\nskeletons, are vulnerable to blunt force. Where\\\\\\'s a good bludgeon...the\\\\ncrystal ball holder. Attack with holder!\\\\nUnfortunately, Duffy\\\\\\'s afterthoughts inspire the Not-Sydney demon to\\\\nplay with the funny little monsters and rules of D&D. At least they\\\\\\'re\\\\nwell-known, right?\\\\n\\\\nChapter Four: Necrotic Progression\\\\nAfter the crickets stop, Gibbs pulls everyone out of the store with\\\\nplans to escape the mall, which is now in lock-down. You, as Duffy, have\\\\nnow been entrusted with being the group tank.\\\\n\\\\nThe only other person we care about in the mall is Trott (and even if we\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t care, he knows how to open the doors) so let\\\\\\'s go find him. You\\\\nmight as well drop that holder, as it\\\\\\'s broken.\\\\n\\\\nWith Trott being as smart as he is, he would have gone to security to\\\\nfind a way to lock out monsters or find weapons. We have to make sure\\\\nhe\\\\\\'s okay either way. Go east twice and then south to get back to your\\\\nstore. Pick up the stool if you want to use another blunt object. E to\\\\nback office, x handprint on the window. X shelves, then LOOK IN\\\\ncardboard box to get the Sierra Hobbies Gamer Glove. N to move on from\\\\ndumping ground to lounge. Open the door to get into the security room\\\\nantechamber. \\\\nTrott must not have heard us. The doors may be kept shut for a reason.\\\\nMaybe we haven\\\\\\'t checked everything yet...Damn.\\\\n\\\\nZombie: Gibs makes a good start on attacking the zombie but his lacrosse\\\\nstick is knocked away and you have to save him lest you get two zombies\\\\non your neck. TAKE STICK and do not let it go. You will need this more\\\\noften. \\\\nAttack zombie with stick!\\\\nTalk to Gibs to see if he is okay and to cheer him up with the story of\\\\nlosing your virginity...on 9/11.\\\\nTrott is actually quite well and will not turn into a zombie soon, one\\\\nof the few benefits of being a chubby nerd. He will open doors if you\\\\nask him nicely. He offers to open the Sports Store door now, but I\\\\nprefer the \\\\\\'later\\\\\\' option as the girls are just outside and have no\\\\nweapons. When he gives you the switched-on phone, just talk to Trott\\\\nwhen you\\\\\\'re back at the sporting goods store.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, there may be a few potential improvised weapons in the sport\\\\nshop, even if it\\\\\\'s just a door knob in a sock. I like taking this moment\\\\nto talk to Casey, especially about boyfriends, caps and Audrey being\\\\nhappiest with you. However, get in that store when the screams start!\\\\n\\\\nGhoul: X ghoul. Gibs is brave enough to draw attention away from Audrey,\\\\nbut becomes paralysed due to direct contact with it. If you haven\\\\\\'t\\\\nalready, get those socks from outside the shop. Wear socks (as mittens\\\\nso they protect your hands). Attack!\\\\n\\\\nAudrey takes you to see if an exit can be found, leaving Casey to look\\\\nafter Gibs. What she finds instead is a suspected wraith at the perfume\\\\ncounter and pulls you into the jewelry store to hide.\\\\n\\\\nThis part was a bit tricky.\\\\nTalk to Audrey as the vision unfolds. Empty pleather purse, and take the\\\\nsilver comb that drops. Wraiths don\\\\\\'t like silver.\\\\nWhen you first notice Audrey\\\\\\'s shadow acting strangely, attack shadow\\\\nwith comb. Shadows also hate silver and we don\\\\\\'t want it hurting Audrey.\\\\nIt will crumble and Duffy will entertain the risky idea of getting the\\\\nwraith inside to lower the temperature so the safe will open and get rid\\\\nof the wraith.\\\\nYell to bring the wraith over. Now it\\\\\\'s a waiting game. Watch\\\\nAs soon as that sleazy bastard makes the safe lock open, open safe, take\\\\nsilver rings and then throw those rings at the wraith. It will now turn\\\\nto dust and it is safe to leave.\\\\n\\\\nThe make-up kiosk is broken, but there is a bottle of perfume to be\\\\nsalvaged. Not a gift for Audrey though. Throw that bottle of perfume\\\\nover the railing to get rid of that horrible smell. \\\\nIN to enter elevator. Press \\\\\\'Down\\\\\\'. Press \\\\\\'Open Doors\\\\\\'. \\\\nWest.\\\\nGhast: This guy hates cleanliness more than a sharehouse slacker. Take\\\\nwater from the fountain. Throw water from the fountain at it. Even you\\\\nfeel sorry for the hopeless sap.\\\\n\\\\nFor fun, go north, the display case at the Sunglass Hut and grab those\\\\nshades.\\\\nLips in Poster Store: Be polite, there\\\\\\'s no need to tempt fate. Listen\\\\ncarefully to directions out and turn the flip rack to see the posters,\\\\nsome even relevant to your quest. Remember the candles, text and water.\\\\nSpectre: Be nice. We\\\\\\'ll need him later. Never tempt the non-immediately\\\\nhostile creatures.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t help the poor dead girl crucified in the cheap paperback\\\\nbookstore, but the text by her will be helpful. Take text. If you read\\\\npink text with messed-up capitalization and accusations of being screwed\\\\nup, you are taking the right things to banish Not-Sydney.\\\\n\\\\nRevenant in Candle Shop: Be nice. Tell him his murderer was the\\\\nNot-Sydney if you like. Talk to Audrey during the vision. Take menorah.\\\\nTake the urn from the crappy party favors store. Go back to the\\\\nfountain. Take water. Put water into urn.\\\\n\\\\nGet back to the west side where Gibs and Casey were digging up rubble\\\\nfor the way out until a vampire lady stole her. We can still save Casey\\\\nbut we need protection in the form of garlic and to handle that\\\\npoltergeist throwing stuff at us.\\\\nPoltergeist: Drop all items at health store. W. Take all. E. Drop all.\\\\nRepeat this until there is nothing there to play with. \\\\n\\\\nAt the Health store, search shelf. Take ointment. You will most likely\\\\nneed this shortly. Move down, move further into the coffin room, then\\\\ninto the alcove and take the garlic from the trestle. Immediately, you\\\\nhave triggered the mummy, possibly Guardian of the Garlic? \\\\nMummy: This guy\\\\\\'s strong, fast and poisonous for being dead for so long,\\\\nso you can\\\\\\'t take too many hits and running away will only mean you get\\\\nhit in the back. It can be infuriatingly funny if you make a dash back\\\\nto the shop during the fight because Gibs will warn that the mummy\\\\\\'s\\\\nbehind you just as the last hit and poison is killing you. \\\\n\\\\nSo...\\\\nBack to coffin room. South to go out. (Listen for the bang as the mummy\\\\nhits the bracket). North to go in again. Throw stick at bracket. The\\\\ntorch will fall and burn the mummy to a crisp. Take stick.\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re touched from the hits: Open jar. Take salve. \\\\\\'Put salve on me\\\\\\'\\\\nto cure mummy ichor.\\\\n\\\\nSearch the coffin. You will find a blood bag amongst the dried blood.\\\\nAlways good to have some of the universal type lying around, so take it.\\\\nGet back to near the fountain. The spectre is friendly enough, despite\\\\nhis chilly exterior. He\\\\\\'s happy to hold onto the blood for you and keep\\\\nit in good nick.\\\\n\\\\nW.\\\\nVampire: We have our garlic now. Attack with stick to eventually stake\\\\nheart. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s go NW to get out of here. Not-Sydney is back now, but we have the\\\\ntools to banish the demon.\\\\nFollow Audrey\\\\\\'s cue to read the text.\\\\nAs far as drinking the water goes, we need a virgin. Who is a virgin?\\\\nWell, not our main characters and Trott\\\\\\'s too far away anyway. Ah, the\\\\nhead of the ghast you felt sorry for as you defeated it! No one would\\\\ntouch someone that awful.\\\\nPour water into the head.\\\\n\\\\nYou need to light a candle to finish the banishing ritual. X menorah.\\\\nNote white candle. Trott will appear and give you a lighter.\\\\nLight white candle with lighter.\\\\nNow the demon is defeated and cowed as you explain that your friends\\\\nthat allegedly slowed you down are the ones who helped you get there,\\\\nand that the tabletop games fundamentally teach you about working\\\\ntogether, using your strengths to assist others\\\\\\' weaknesses and\\\\nprotecting them so that they can repay you.\\\\nSydney is now safe. Casey is not out of the woods yet, but the main\\\\ndanger is gone. \\\\nGibs will be telling you of the time you have left to save Casey. The\\\\nvampire curse may be gone, but so is a lot of her blood. \\\\nN.\\\\n\\\\nBecause you gave the blood bag to the spectre, he will now appear and\\\\ngive it back. Audrey, being a good medical student, can now start the\\\\ntransfusion to save her and you immediately know the video store is a\\\\ngood isolated, dark place for a makeshift surgery. With the help of your\\\\nfriends, your grit and a lot of D&D knowledge, you have saved a life and\\\\nmay have kicked smoking. However...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEpilogue\\\\nStory time. Four months later, Benji\\\\\\'s turned the arcade into something\\\\nmore like a junk store. With Dance Dance Revolution knock-offs and\\\\nvomiting dolls. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\\\nEveryone has pretended the incident never happened. Casey has severed\\\\nall contact from you. Audrey moved to Texas anyway, leaving you behind.\\\\nThis portion is conversation dependent, so talk a bit to Trott. It turns\\\\nout we couldn\\\\\\'t have used him at the end and he\\\\\\'s convinced there are\\\\nseveral mundane explanations for that night.\\\\nAttack the reappearing bot before it attacks you.

This is the solution to \"Everybody Loves a Parade\" -- my first\\\\nwork of interactive fiction. After the solution is a self-indulgent\\\\ncommentary on the genesis and development of \"Parade\". (Later on, I\\\\\\'ll\\\\nget even more self-indulgent when I leave off the quotation marks.) I\\\\\\'ve\\\\nalso included some hints for future TADS programmers which may or may\\\\nnot come in handy. I apologize ahead of time for any unhandy hints.\\\\n\\\\nCody Sandifer (sandifer@crmse.sdsu.edu)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE SOLUTION:\\\\n\\\\nIn general, studies in museums have shown that people are more likely to\\\\nturn right than left, so the order of the solutions might be backwards.\\\\nNo, I am not kidding about the studies.\\\\n\\\\nThe \"endgame\" puzzles are two or three pages down the line.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t find your way across the puddle in the laundromat...\\\\n\\\\nI suppose that you already tried to jump the darn thing. It won\\\\\\'t work,\\\\nbut it\\\\\\'s fun to try anyway. I included mop as a verb only because a\\\\nplaytester suggested it -- there isn\\\\\\'t a mop anywhere. Perhaps you could\\\\ncover the puddle with something? The something would have to be large in\\\\nan absorbent kind of way, making the puddle safe to walk upon. It\\\\\\'s on\\\\nthe floor somewhere. In the pub. If you can\\\\\\'t find a container, you\\\\nshould do some serious searching -- especially in the tank area. You can\\\\nprobably figure out the next step yourself. What kind of machine hangs\\\\nout in a laundromat? The date on the receptacle is a clue, albeit a lame\\\\none. Put the dollar coin in the vertical slot. You\\\\\\'re in the money!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t get the valuable rock in the rock museum...\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of Chewton installed an alarm, but they\\\\\\'re rather,\\\\nahhh......stupid. The key isn\\\\\\'t difficult to find once you take this\\\\nfact into account. I can\\\\\\'t use invisiclues, so I\\\\\\'ll just type in the\\\\nanswer backwards: (.elbat eht rednu si yek ehT) Don\\\\\\'t bother holding the\\\\nclue up to a mirror -- you\\\\\\'ll just get confused. The letters are\\\\nforwards even though the words are backwards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t get the bikers to leave the bar...\\\\n\\\\nYou could act on your violent desires, but that\\\\\\'ll just get you\\\\npoetically smacked around. They seem to be intent on completing their\\\\nritual -- remember the perfect note? I bet you could find one. If you\\\\\\'re\\\\nlooking for a tape recorder, don\\\\\\'t bother. I decided that there was way\\\\ntoo much random noise to allow players to tape everything audible. Plus,\\\\nyou\\\\\\'d probably get sick of hearing \"Why would you want to tape that?\" a\\\\nmillion times. Oh yeah -- the note is in a lofty place. Those choruses\\\\nreally know their stuff. You haven\\\\\\'t been to heaven, you say? Take a\\\\ngood look at the pebbles on the tank. Then throw something at them --\\\\nbut make sure you haven\\\\\\'t stolen the smock first.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t get the mechanic to pay any attention to you...\\\\n\\\\nEven with the hints I programmed into the game? Really? Kick \\\\\\'em twice.\\\\nIf you don\\\\\\'t, your thoughts will nag you 50 turns later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t find anything to give the mechanic...\\\\n\\\\nTake a good look at the objects in the pub. Specifically, the (elbat\\\\nloop). Is this backwards thing annoying you? I hate reading clues before\\\\nI\\\\\\'m ready, so I figured that this is a fair compromise. If you\\\\\\'re\\\\ndyslexic, I\\\\\\'m probably destroying whatever letter sense you\\\\\\'ve developed\\\\nthrough years of hard work. Sorry.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t get the money from the juggler\\\\\\'s hat...\\\\n\\\\nThis one is pretty tough, actually. To get the cash, you\\\\\\'ll need to\\\\ndistract the juggler. If you haven\\\\\\'t already thrown something at the\\\\njuggler, you should try it out. If you\\\\\\'re still stuck, take a good look\\\\nat what she\\\\\\'s juggling. The balls are round. Sound familiar?\\\\nSpecifically, throw another round item at the juggler. If I haven\\\\\\'t\\\\nscrewed up, there\\\\\\'s only one other round item in the game. It\\\\\\'s the\\\\n(kcor elbaulav). If you *still* can\\\\\\'t get it to work, it\\\\\\'s because the\\\\nrock (darn, I just ruined it) doesn\\\\\\'t look enough like the balls. What\\\\\\'s\\\\nspecial about the balls? You got it: (egnaro er\\\\\\'yeht). You can turn the\\\\nrock (egnaro) by painting it twice. I\\\\\\'m not sure that this would work in\\\\nreal life, which is why I added the bit about the paint \"doing funny\\\\nthings sometimes\" if you ask the salesman about the paint.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t figure out what to do with the corn dogs...\\\\n\\\\nWhatever you do, don\\\\\\'t eat them. I left the obnoxious hunger daemon out\\\\nof the game. If you chow down, the game will be unwinnable. So, what to\\\\ndo? As any good American will tell you, it\\\\\\'s nice to have money. ($8\\\\nworth, in this game) I provided a heavy-handed hint in the description\\\\nof the cart. Try selling them. If that doesn\\\\\\'t work, it\\\\\\'s because you\\\\\\'re\\\\nnot dressed appropriately. Would you buy a corn dog from a weirdo on the\\\\nstreet? Even one as good-looking as you are? A salesperson should at\\\\nleast *look* official. You\\\\\\'ll need the smock in the uniform shop. The\\\\ncorn dogs should be in the cart before you try selling them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t find a way to get the smock...\\\\n\\\\nDid you read the description carefully when you tried to get the smock?\\\\n(You\\\\\\'ll never get the tailor\\\\\\'s attention, so don\\\\\\'t bother. Not even by\\\\ndancing.) There are a number of actions in the game that your conscience\\\\nwon\\\\\\'t allow you to do. This is one of them. Is there a way around your\\\\nconscience? Maybe if you (knurd tog).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t figure out what to do with the whiskey...\\\\n\\\\nTry drinking the whiskey again. Be sure to read the reaction carefully.\\\\n(I really did try to hint at most of the solutions in the game.)\\\\n\"Straight\" implies that you might be able to drink the whiskey with\\\\nsomething else. A (ados) will do the trick, although you\\\\\\'ll need money\\\\nto buy one first. Once you get drunk, try acting slightly immoral. You\\\\nknow -- steal some stuff. At one point, I considered running a \"guilt\"\\\\ndaemon late in the game to make the player feel bad. I never got around\\\\nto it, though.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t get the goddam (or goddamn, according to my progressive\\\\nspellchecker) apple without the old man checking out your action...\\\\n\\\\nYou can try to take, kick, and throw stuff at the apple. You can try to\\\\nhassle the old man. None of it will work. The only way to get rid of the\\\\nold man is to satisfy his craving. Buy him a little boy! (Just kidding.\\\\nThe dirty old man isn\\\\\\'t Michael Jackson.) You\\\\\\'ll have to scrounge up 8\\\\nbucks first. Once you get the (nig), let him have it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve satisfied the mechanic\\\\\\'s requirement.  What do I do now?\\\\n\\\\nDid you tell him about the parade? He\\\\\\'s in need of a good convincing. At\\\\nthis point, you should be painfully aware of your (redneg). Use it to\\\\nyour advantage. (It\\\\\\'s probably too late to warn you, but I disallowed\\\\n[kcuf] as an option. Aside from 40 goddams and 20 hells, I decided to\\\\nkeep the game relatively clean.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHOW PARADE GOT ITSELF MADE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBefore I start, I want to apologize if you find this overly\\\\nself-indulgent. Personally, I enjoy behind-the-scenes analyses of\\\\nmovies, books, and other kinds of arty things. I thought others might\\\\nfeel the same way, so I put my thoughts to paper. If anything else, I\\\\\\'ll\\\\nbe glad to have this record for whenever I get motivated to write\\\\nanother game. Here goes!\\\\n\\\\nAfter a long break, I got back into playing interactive fiction games\\\\nlate in 1996. Flames of Perdition was a whole mess of fun, but I was\\\\nimpressed that games such as Wedding and Uncle Zebulon\\\\\\'s Will were\\\\nplayable, entertaining, and (most importantly of all) SHORT! I didn\\\\\\'t\\\\nwant to spend an entire year on a game (or two, or three -- you know who\\\\nyou are). I figured that I could bust out a game in three weeks. And --\\\\nyou know what -- I *did* bust out a game in three weeks. Version 1,\\\\nanyway.\\\\n\\\\nBefore I began programming, I read the manual, drew a map, and penciled\\\\nin objects and puzzles. (Not that the outline was in its the final form,\\\\nmind you. Looking over my notes, I originally included a golf course at\\\\nthe eastern end of the parade and a couple of additional puzzles: (1)\\\\nstealing money from an organ grinder monkey, and (2) escaping from the\\\\nvan (initially) by popping a balloon with the lighter. In case you were\\\\nwondering, I got sick of programming and canned the extra puzzles.)\\\\n\\\\nThe introduction was the very first thing I wrote, which is probably why\\\\nit\\\\\\'s so damn long. One playtester complained about its length, but I\\\\ndecided to leave it as-is.\\\\n\\\\nUp next was the daily typing ritual. Over Christmas break, I programmed\\\\nfor three weeks straight -- sometimes, up to 10 hours/day. (I\\\\\\'m a\\\\ncollege student, which was how I found the time. I originally had four\\\\nor five college references in the game, although I\\\\\\'ve since deleted most\\\\nof them. There\\\\\\'s probably some truth to the advice about \"writing what\\\\nyou know\", but i-f games with collegiate themes bug the hell out of me.\\\\nKissing the Buddha\\\\\\'s Feet is a prominent exception.) \\\\n\\\\nAs a TADS beginner, I spent most of the original 3 weeks figuring out\\\\nhow to implement the puzzles in TADS. I averaged about a puzzle a day.\\\\nAlthough most experienced programmers advise against it, my working room\\\\ndescriptions were short lists of objects and actors (you know, like the\\\\nold Scott Adams type of games). I wrote most of the room descriptions\\\\nthe day before I shipped out Version 1 to playtesters. Since Parade was\\\\na relatively small game, it worked out OK. I would advise against it for\\\\nlarger games.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere are some concerns I had early on:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSince Parade takes place in the real world (sorta), I had to restrict\\\\nthe player\\\\\\'s movement with something other than cave-ins and giant\\\\nBalrogs. That\\\\\\'s how I thought of the train. Eventually, I walled the\\\\nplayer in with the parade itself. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe whole money thing was a real pain. I\\\\\\'m just now learning how to\\\\nprogram indistinguishable objects, so an entire inventory of droppable\\\\nmoney (both coins *and* bills) was out of the question. That\\\\\\'s how I\\\\ncame up with an undroppable wad of cash that incremented only in whole\\\\ndollar amounts.\\\\n\\\\nDue the lack of female leads in i-f, I knew from the start that I wanted\\\\nthe player to be a woman. Also, I thought it would be tremendously funny\\\\nto provoke a gender re- evaluation halfway through the game.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBefore initial playtesting:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHeaven and hell didn\\\\\\'t exist. (If you didn\\\\\\'t find hell, you can get\\\\nthere by trying some of the \"fun stuff\" that I outlined.)\\\\n\\\\nThe bikers (arbitrarily, I now realize) left the pub after 4 visits.\\\\nThis mystified most playtesters, since there was no sign of their\\\\ndeparture other than a brief \"The table\\\\\\'s free!\" comment when the player\\\\nre-entered the pub. The apple could be found by searching the pool table\\\\n-- it had fallen into one of the pockets. Also, in contrast to the rest\\\\nof the characters, the bikers had no personality to speak of. \"Rocks\"\\\\nwas how one playtester described them.\\\\n\\\\nI didn\\\\\\'t nudge the player with thoughts about getting the mechanic\\\\\\'s\\\\nattention.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter initial playtesting:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI gave the bikers personalities and made it obvious when they left the\\\\npub. After exiting a second time, the bikers pushed the player aside and\\\\nwandered into the crowd. To find the apple, you still had to search the\\\\npool table.\\\\n\\\\nI added a ton of inspectable objects, new verbs, and minor bug fixes.\\\\nSome major bug fixes, too. If you dropped the apple in the initial\\\\nversion, you could never pick it back up. \"But you already have the\\\\napple!\" Oops. Also, you could get the old man wasted with the gin\\\\nwithout ever trying to pick up the apple. Since the player has to be\\\\naware of his/her sex before confronting the apple-munching mechanic,\\\\nthis made the game impossible to win.\\\\n\\\\nI still didn\\\\\\'t include the nudging \"thoughts\" about getting the\\\\nmechanic\\\\\\'s attention. As a result, some players (still) had no idea why\\\\nthe hell getting the apple was so damn important. Since getting the\\\\napple is the motivation for the whole plot, I thought it best to pound\\\\nthe player with hints if s/he didn\\\\\\'t smack the mechanic a few times. (In\\\\nretrospect, I now see the dangers in programming a highly linear game\\\\nwhere leaving a single puzzle unsolved can screw up everything.)\\\\n\\\\nI wrote a bunch more atmospheric texts. (e.g. \"The paint salesman rolls\\\\nhis eyes.\") Originally, there were 5-7 per noisy room. I ended up with\\\\n10-15 per room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSomewhere around final playtesting:   (some modifications just before, \\\\nsome just after)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI included plurals. (\"The clowns doesn\\\\\\'t appear appetizing\" really\\\\nstarted to annoy me.)\\\\n\\\\nI changed the bikers into a puzzle. Getting them to leave was no longer\\\\narbitrary. (At this point, the afterlife already existed -- but purely\\\\nfor fun. Only those players who threw something at the tank could find\\\\nit. Finally, I realized that I could tie heaven to the bikers by giving\\\\nthem musical tendencies.)\\\\n\\\\nI made the apple fall to the floor. At first, I left the apple on the\\\\ntable when the bikers left -- until someone pointed out that you don\\\\\\'t\\\\nneed to bend over to pick up an apple off the surface of a pool table.\\\\nSo, I made the apple fall off the table and wedge itself. No complaints\\\\nabout apples rolling on sawdust, please.\\\\n\\\\nI modified the smock slightly. Many playtesters pointed out that wearing\\\\nthe (originally tight) smock was a valid solution to the wedged apple\\\\npuzzle. I got around this by (1) making the smock loose and (2)\\\\ngenerating an appropriate message when the player goes for the apple\\\\nwhile wearing the smock. Unfair? Maybe so.\\\\n\\\\nI added in a few other comedy bits (esp. the Giant Sack).\\\\n\\\\nI downsized the Mound of Quartz room description. The original Mound of\\\\nQuartz room description included the information that now pops up when\\\\nyou inspect the upper class. It was overwhelming (still is, maybe),\\\\nwhich is why I backgrounded the unnecessary detail. Also, I moved the\\\\nATM machine from the Mound of Quartz to the Minimall Entrance to make\\\\nthe Quartz room description more manageable.\\\\n\\\\nLikewise, because I was unhappy with my writing, I erased or relocated\\\\nmost of the original Uniform Shop room description. The wind, ghost, and\\\\nominously looming objects are brand new. (Not even seen by the final\\\\nplaytesters, actually. I bet that\\\\\\'s how typos creep in.)\\\\n\\\\nOn one playtester\\\\\\'s suggestion, I disallowed the use of \"all\" with\\\\nnearly every verb: all but \\\\\\'get\\\\\\', \\\\\\'put\\\\\\', \\\\\\'take\\\\\\', and \\\\\\'drop\\\\\\'. The\\\\nplaytester had used \"smell all\" as a way to get a quick list of every\\\\ninspectable object. He had even solved the perfect note puzzle this way.\\\\n(Note, however, that the use of \"examine all\" allowed early playtesters\\\\nto figure out which items I accidentally omitted from room descriptions.\\\\nIn Version 1, I had forgotten to include the bulletin board (Rock\\\\nMuseum) and desk (Garage).)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost playtesters still didn\\\\\\'t like the late revelation of the player\\\\\\'s\\\\nsex. (Which can come *really* late now that getting the bikers to leave\\\\nis a puzzle.) After wavering back and forth for a couple of weeks, I\\\\ndecided not to give in to peer pressure. \\\\n\\\\nOn the suggestion of playtesters, I added in a few more things for the\\\\nplayer to do when drunk (jumping over the puddle and reading the porno\\\\nmag, in particular).\\\\n\\\\nI included standard TADS instructions (with a few minor changes to\\\\ninteractions with characters) just because I could.\\\\n\\\\nHell was created for my own amusement.  Since there\\\\\\'s a heaven, why not?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChanges for v2.2:\\\\n\\\\nI corrected a major bug in the pub. Before the bug fix, TADS allowed\\\\nplayers to \"show\" every visible item. Thus, it was possible for the\\\\noffended biker to grind the bartender, the old man, and the pool table\\\\nbeneath his boot. Man, that\\\\\\'s one powerful boot. \\\\n\\\\nI made it easier to get to hell. Rather than solve the puzzles in a\\\\nparticular order, the player can now get to hell by throwing an object\\\\nat the tank *after* stealing the smock. Jumping over the puddle while\\\\ndrunk now transports the player to limbo. You can also get to limbo by\\\\nriding the train. Thanks to Admiral Jota for the smock-stealing\\\\nsuggestion.\\\\n\\\\nThe player can now become a hobo by climbing on the train. I did this\\\\nmainly as a programming exercise to see if I could get the train to\\\\nstart and stop like the elephant in Graham Nelson\\\\\\'s \"The Meteor, the\\\\nStone, and the Tall Glass of Sherbet.\" (Sorry if I remembered the title\\\\nincorrectly.) Thanks to Stephen Granade for the train-hopping\\\\nsuggestion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClosing comments:\\\\n\\\\nThe playtesting and revising of games takes a *lot* of time. Version 1\\\\n(130k) came out in January. The first public version of Parade (Version\\\\n2.1 @ 264k) came out in March 1997. Before the final release, I must\\\\nhave played my own game 30 damn times. At least.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, writing this game was a lot of fun! Give it a try! To this end,\\\\nhere are a few hints for those who want to give TADS a try. I highly\\\\nrecommend it. (To help persuade you, keep in mind that, before TADS, my\\\\nlast bout with programming was a beginning Pascal course in 1986.) \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTADS ADVICE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMERS:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you think it\\\\\\'ll help, I\\\\\\'d be glad to share code with anyone\\\\ninterested in programming. Otherwise, here are some helpful hints for\\\\nhopeful programmers:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1. The Synonym and -> shortcuts save a lot of typing. Use \\\\\\'em whenever\\\\npossible.\\\\n\\\\n2. Programming doVerbPrep(actor,iobj) stuff is a real pain (as in \"cover\\\\npuddle with sawdust\", where \"puddle\" is the important object for the\\\\nverb). Redirect the ioVerbPrep action to the doVerbPrep like it says in\\\\nthe Book of the Parser. Otherwise, the doVerbPrep never gets accessed.\\\\n(Can you say 2 wasted hours? I can.)\\\\n\\\\n3. Take care of important details as you stumble across them. Don\\\\\\'t wait\\\\nuntil later! For example, I programmed the responses to the improper use\\\\nof the paint machine (while the safety door was open, etc.) because I\\\\nknew that I would forget later on. Your playtesters will get cranky if\\\\nyou don\\\\\\'t anticipate these details. Speaking of which...\\\\n\\\\n4. Use playtesters. They\\\\\\'re nuts, but they\\\\\\'re a big help. Like I said,\\\\nVersion 1 was only 130k.\\\\n\\\\n5. Use the plurals.t module on ftp.gmd.de if you want to incorporate\\\\nplurals. (Don\\\\\\'t forget bugs.t, too!) This module may become pronouns.t\\\\nin the future.\\\\n\\\\n6. Be sure that you don\\\\\\'t modify a class property (the container class\\\\nverDoLookin property, e.g.) more than once. Unfortunately, the compiler\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\'t warn you when this happens; it just keeps the latest\\\\nmodification.\\\\n\\\\n7. In a related topic, be sure to check ADV.T before you modify a class\\\\nproperty. You might wipe out something important. (By the way, both\\\\nADV.T and STD.T are worth a good look before you start.)\\\\n\\\\n8. Unless you modify ADV.T, TADS allows players to \"put\" things that\\\\nthey aren\\\\\\'t carrying. This can lead to serious bugs if you forget to\\\\nblock the \"put\" verb for inaccessible items (a wedged apple, for\\\\ninstance). If you don\\\\\\'t believe me, put the bush from Unnkulian I in the\\\\nbucket. Or, put the gold bar, anchor, or bookmark from Unnkulian II on\\\\nthe went board. My solution was to forbid the player from \"putting\"\\\\nanything that he or she isn\\\\\\'t carrying; Inform does the same thing. (I\\\\nshould know, since I stole Inform\\\\\\'s default \"put\" response.)\\\\n\\\\n9. If you replace the default ldesc (long description) of a surface or\\\\ncontainer object, any attempt to look in or search the container/surface\\\\nwill call up the response \"There\\\\\\'s nothing on/in the surface/container.\"\\\\nSilly, I know. Bugs.t repairs this oversight.\\\\n\\\\n10. If you want to trigger a daemon more than once, don\\\\\\'t forget to\\\\nreset its counter to zero.\\\\n\\\\n11. Watch James Cagney movies. Public Enemy, Strawberry Blonde, and\\\\nWhite Heat are good places to start.\\\\n\\\\n12. If you replace one object with another (a live monkey with a dead\\\\none, for example), don\\\\\\'t forget to setit(new_object). This way, the\\\\npronoun \"it\" will refer to the new object.\\\\n\\\\n13. Create separate files (verbs.t, modifications.t, actors.t,\\\\npaint_shop.t, etc.) from the very beginning. This makes it *much* easier\\\\nto locate code for future revisions.\\\\n\\\\n14. It\\\\\\'s your own damn game. Do whatever the hell you want.\\\\n\\\\n15. Read the manual and download lots of source code. If that doesn\\\\\\'t\\\\nwork, don\\\\\\'t be afraid to look like an idiot on rec.arts.i-f. I\\\\\\'ll be\\\\nglad to keep you company.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'This is a walkthrough for Emily Short\\\\\\'s _Pytho\\\\\\'s Mask_.\\\\n\\\\nX MINISTER\\\\nA - \"Have you seen the comet before?\"\\\\nA - \"Who sails it?\"\\\\nA - \"What does mythology say of the comet?\"\\\\nA - \"Even a brief example would interest me, I\\\\\\'m sure.\"\\\\nA - \"Are there other stories about the comet?\"\\\\nB - \"Are there any old stories about the Kings?\"\\\\nB - \"What happened between the Earth woman and the king?\"\\\\nC - \"Are there any old stories about the Moon?\"\\\\nTOPIC MOON\\\\nA - \"How long ago did you join the cabinet?\"\\\\nA - \"Is there dissension in the cabinet?\"\\\\nTOPIC CABINET\\\\nA - \"Why did the Prince leave the cabinet?\"\\\\nB - \"What do you think of the Earth minister?\"\\\\nTOPIC CABINET\\\\nA - \"What do you think of the Court Physician?\"\\\\nA - \"What do you think is happening to the king?\"\\\\nA - \"It was a pleasure speaking to you.\"\\\\nLOOK\\\\nI\\\\nX PURSE\\\\nOPEN PURSE\\\\nX GOLD\\\\nX SILVER\\\\nX CAPE\\\\nX CARD\\\\nX RING\\\\n\\\\n*** Now we try the sun court ***\\\\n\\\\nEAST\\\\nX KING\\\\nTALK TO KING\\\\n\\\\n*** We can\\\\\\'t go north yet, but it\\\\\\'s worth checking out the barrier ***\\\\n\\\\nX FOOTMAN\\\\nN\\\\n\\\\n*** Instead, let\\\\\\'s head south to the games room***\\\\n\\\\nS\\\\nX TABLE\\\\n\\\\n*** Avril will insult us ***\\\\n\\\\nA - Thank you for rescuing me there.\\\\nA - I am Soteria.

As well as all\\\\n  the typical Adventure commands (Take, Give, Examine, Look) you may\\\\n  well need some slightly less obvious instructions (especially those\\\\n  regarding the fairer sex...).  One other point to bear in mind,\\\\n  Gentlemen may Fence but they rarely simply Attack.  On with the show....\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA few things not mentioned in this paragraph are two very important\\\\ncommands.  The first is common in TADS games, which is \"TALK TO X\"\\\\nwhere X is a character name.  With this command, you can figure out\\\\nthe game and complete it, but most likely not score above 50/100 points.\\\\n\\\\nThe second is a special command for this game, that being \"SPANK X\", where\\\\nX is again a character name.  With these two commands you should be able\\\\nto complete the game with a full score of 100 points...  However, if you\\\\nare stuck, a blatant walkthrough is listed below.\\\\n\\\\nAlso note that there is a bug in the game which allows you to amass a\\\\nscore well above 100.  Giving anything to Alicia will increment your\\\\nscore by +15 points (possibly dependent on TADS runtime version) while\\\\nonly one particular item in the game should give you 15 points when\\\\nyou give it to Alicia (don\\\\\\'t worry, YOU\\\\\\'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT,\\\\nand it\\\\\\'s in the walkthrough).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBlatant Walkthrough\\\\n\\\\n(Darcy\\\\\\'s Home)\\\\n\\\\ntake letter\\\\nread letter\\\\ne,e,e,d\\\\n\\\\n(The Crypt)\\\\n\\\\nopen coffin\\\\ntake key\\\\nu,w,s\\\\n\\\\n(Outside the Cardinal\\\\\\'s Residence)\\\\ns\\\\ntalk to claude (until you read the \"cat\" responses)\\\\nn,w,n,e,n,e\\\\n\\\\n(Library)\\\\n\\\\nunlock cabinet  {flirt with, then spank countess when you see her}\\\\nopen cabinet\\\\ntake book\\\\nw,s\\\\nread book\\\\ne\\\\n\\\\n(Throne Room)\\\\ngive silk drawers to king\\\\nw,w,s,s,s,s\\\\n\\\\n(Tavern Yard)\\\\n\\\\nopen bin\\\\ntake bottle\\\\nn,u,e\\\\nopen chest\\\\ntake dildo     {Give dildo to Alicia when you see her}\\\\nw,d,n,e,s\\\\n\\\\n(Apothecary\\\\\\'s Shop)\\\\n\\\\ntalk to alchemist (until you read the \"potion\" and \"if only\" responses)\\\\ngive book\\\\ngive bottle\\\\nn,w,n,n,e,s,u\\\\n\\\\n(Upper floor of Tower)\\\\n\\\\ngive bottle to guard\\\\ne\\\\n\\\\n(Queen\\\\\\'s Bedroom)\\\\n\\\\ntalk to queen\\\\nw,d,n,w,s,s,s\\\\n\\\\n(Tavern)\\\\n\\\\ntalk to cat (until you read the \"learn\" and \"bauble\" responses)\\\\nspank cat\\\\ngive brooch to cat\\\\nn,n,e,s\\\\n\\\\n(Outside the Cardinal\\\\\\'s Residence)\\\\n\\\\nfight claude\\\\ns,u,n,d,e\\\\n\\\\n(Cardinal\\\\\\'s Study)\\\\n\\\\ntake book\\\\nopen desk drawer\\\\ntake garter, note\\\\nw,n,n,w,n,e,s,u,e\\\\n\\\\n(Queen\\\\\\'s Bedroom)\\\\n\\\\n{You should have 65/100 points here.}\\\\n\\\\ngive garter to queen\\\\n\\\\n{You should have 100/100 points here.}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHAVE YOU TRIED...\\\\n\\\\n  spanking the queen?\\\\n  giving the dildo to the alchemist?\\\\n  spanking Alicia?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\"Walkthrough for Hunt For Relief - Relief.z5\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\nThis Walkthrough is (c) by Christian Gaertner, who happens to be the author of the game\\\\nas it is one of my first games, there are some unfair puzzles, i think\\\\nthough I provided a hint system (the notebook), here is the walkthrough:\\\\n\\\\n(the fridge and the gloves are useless for now, perhaps the block of ice is misleading, as it is water after all)\\\\n\\\\nx desk\\\\nopen drawer\\\\nget all from drawer\\\\nopen bathroom\\\\n(hmm...let\\\\\\'s try again)\\\\nopen bathroom\\\\n(okay, but we got the key)\\\\nunlock bathroom with key\\\\n(that was predictable. we will need some glue)\\\\ninsert magnet in keyhole\\\\ni\\\\nx acid\\\\nl\\\\n(we will start by examining all things here)\\\\nx bed\\\\nl\\\\nget book\\\\nget floppy\\\\nx book\\\\nlook up acid in book\\\\nlook up salpetric in it\\\\nlook up glue in it\\\\nlook up sulfuric in it\\\\nx closet\\\\nopen closet\\\\nsearch pile\\\\n(now we got a pot)\\\\nsearch pile\\\\n(no further things here)\\\\nx pot\\\\nlook up glue in book\\\\n(the recipe is clear to us now)\\\\nlook up mammal shit in book\\\\nx pc\\\\nturn on pc\\\\nx floppy\\\\nput floppy in drive\\\\nturn on pc\\\\nx screen\\\\norder glue\\\\norder mammal\\\\nl\\\\nget cube\\\\nx oven\\\\nput pot on oven\\\\nempty bottle on oven\\\\nput pot on oven\\\\nput cube in pot\\\\nl\\\\nx cupboard\\\\nx basin\\\\nfill bottle\\\\nfill bottle at basin\\\\nempty bottle into pot\\\\nfill bottle at basin\\\\nempty bottle into pot\\\\nfill bottle at basin\\\\nempty bottle into pot\\\\nmix glue with spoon\\\\nturn on oven\\\\nget glue\\\\nglue handle to rest\\\\nunlock bathroom with key\\\\nopen bathroom\\\\ns\\\\nopen toilet\\\\nsit on toilet\\\\n(that\\\\\\'s it)\\\\n\\\\nComments, Bugs and so on to Gardner@gmx.net\\\\n\"]\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'Full walkthrough for rematch.\\\\n\\\\nREmatch, as you know, is a one move game.

The precise solutions may not apply to later or earlier versions, or releases in a different format.  Also note that this plot-driven tale relies on a precisely timed series of scenes or events to proceed.  There will be times (indicated with a \\\\\\'z\\\\\\' for \\\\\\'wait\\\\\\') when a certain number of turns, rather than a specific action, will be required for the next event to occur.  While you can spend those turns however you like, I highly recommend taking every opportunity to examine and interact with anything and everything in sight.  The person who simply does what needs to be done to \"win\" won\\\\\\'t get nearly as much out of this story as the person who explores every nook and cranny of the Room and its surrounding spaces.\\\\n\\\\nRoom 206 is light on puzzles, and death should never occur, but there are a few times you\\\\\\'ll be asked to perform action that might not be immediately apparent.  You might also hesitate when the way forward seems clear, but morally ambiguous.

To prepare the way. Very few\\\\npuzzles actually need doing today. Most of this stuff can be put\\\\noff.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you wake up from your dream. (cast the WOO spell and make a\\\\nmove on the girl).\\\\n\\\\nGET BOOK. D. NE. SIT. Once all is loaded on the carpet. the carpet\\\\ncontrols come on. TAKE OFF. Follow the directions in the DOX.TXT\\\\nfile. Print that file up. It is very useful.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you get to Fort Naughtytail, you will have to push everything\\\\noff the carpet. Push the stuff off in whatever order you want. You\\\\nwill find it all by the end on Monday anyway and the only things\\\\nyou really need are the trunk and the lotion.\\\\n\\\\nThe game will carry you along until the confrontation with GLY.\\\\nThen cast the FRIMP spell on each barbell (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)\\\\njust before he tries to lift them. FRIMP takes time to recharge so\\\\nonly cast when he is standing before each barbell.\\\\n\\\\nGo to the souvenir shop. (There is a mapping function in the game\\\\nso I will not give specific directions to most places). Near the\\\\nHotel. Buy the UPPSSY spell.\\\\n\\\\nOpen all spell boxes if you have the book with you, this writes the\\\\nspell in the book for multiple uses.\\\\n\\\\nThen go to the Casino near the center of the village. Cast the\\\\nUPPSSY spell on the casino (UPPSSY CASINO), when you are outside.\\\\nThis makes it no longer \"crooked\" both literally and figuratively.\\\\nThen save the game and go in and PLAY RUELOTTO. Bet on number 6\\\\nuntil you win or have bet six times. If you win go outside and save\\\\nthe game. If you lose restore. Remember if you didn\\\\\\'t cast the\\\\nUPPSSY spell you can never win in the casino. Get about 1800 or so\\\\ngold. This will be as much as you need for the whole game. It takes\\\\npatience but it is worth it in the long run.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have 1800 gold. Buy the key from the rummy in the\\\\ngroggery.\\\\n\\\\nBuy the slimfish from the fish stand in the fish market.\\\\n\\\\nGo to the mouth of the cave and get the haunch. Take it to the end\\\\nof the road (From mouth of cave S.S.SW.)\\\\n\\\\nDrop the haunch. Tomorrow there will be a hole under the fence.\\\\n\\\\nGet the gloves batman dropped at the cliff road. At the bottom of\\\\nthe cliff you will find one of the things you pushed overboard.\\\\n\\\\nGo to the open shops (Pawnshop, hardware store and souvenir) BUY\\\\nALL in each store except the pawnshop. There BUY BOX,BOMB. OPEN\\\\nBOX.\\\\n\\\\nLeave everything but the BOOK AND SHOVEL in the lobby. Go to the\\\\nseafood restaurant (the TOURIST TRAP). SIT.

Although, as the\\\\ngame progresses, you will begin to face enemies that are actually item\\\\nusage puzzles, the core of the game (and what your score is ultimately\\\\nbased on) is a resource management puzzle; the general goal is to\\\\ntrade stamina for damage as efficiently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nBASIC ATTACKS\\\\n\\\\nYou have four basic attacks (ATTACK FISH will cue you with them):\\\\nPUNCH, KICK, SLAP, and BACKHAND.  If they connect, they generally\\\\ncharge you two stamina and inflict two damage.  KICKs are more likely\\\\nto be evaded by smaller fish, and evaded kicks in particular will\\\\ngenerally only cost you a single stamina point.\\\\n\\\\nCOMBINATION ATTACKS\\\\n\\\\nThe cost of a basic attack can vary based on the last few moves you\\\\\\'ve\\\\ndone; this will either deliver extra damage or cost you less stamina\\\\nto perform.  For example, against most enemies you can use the basic\\\\n\"one-two\": if you follow up a SLAP with a BACKHAND, the BACKHAND will\\\\ncost only 1 Stamina but inflict 3 damage.  Thus \"slap/backhand\" is a\\\\ncombo that costs 3 and inflicts 5.\\\\n\\\\nThe difference in combat effectiveness is significant; against the\\\\nfirst opponent (the rainbow trout, who has no counters other than\\\\nimmunity to kicks): with a sequence of nothing but slaps, you will\\\\nneed to attack five times and expend 10 endurance to defeat him. As\\\\nyou start with only five endurance, this works out to 10 turns of\\\\nbattle and five attacks. However, if you instead use one-two combos,\\\\nyou can inflict 10 damage in two iterations, and this means you only\\\\nneed to rest for a single turn, between the two combinations.\\\\n\\\\nRunning out of stamina partway through a combo will interrupt the\\\\ncombo and is always bad.\\\\n\\\\nDifferent fish have different combinations against which they are\\\\nvulnerable. Pay attention to the text you get, as combinations in\\\\nprogress usually have some special text that seem to indicate that a\\\\nmove was unusually effective. This is worthwhile even if it looks like\\\\nthere\\\\\\'s been no extra damage or lesser stamina cost; sometimes\\\\ncompleting a combo will trigger a plot event or environmental effect\\\\nthat will deal loads of damage.  If it looks like a combination hasn\\\\\\'t\\\\npaid off, it\\\\\\'s probable that you just haven\\\\\\'t extended it far enough\\\\nyet.\\\\n\\\\nMoves that do not finish a combination but are nevertheless part of\\\\nthem may actually not do damage; replies to these often will mention\\\\nsomething about the fish becoming exposed or moving into a new\\\\nposition that will suggest a followup.\\\\n\\\\nOPTIMIZING YOUR SCORE\\\\n\\\\nThe scoring itself is based on, effectively, damage per second (DPS)\\\\nand damage per attack (DPA); it\\\\\\'s computed based on how long it takes,\\\\nand how many attacks it took, to take down your foe. Because of the\\\\ncombat and stamina regeneration model, however, optimizing damage per\\\\nendurance (DPE) - the most damage for the least stamina cost - will\\\\nusually optimize both, and so this is the statistic to focus on\\\\nprimarily.\\\\n\\\\nSome items will change the damage of your basic attacks; this may\\\\nchange the total efficiency calculus if you have endurance to\\\\nburn. There is also a point in the game where you can get a full\\\\nstamina recharge, which will be necessary to get a perfect score in\\\\nits fight.\\\\n\\\\nIt is usually unnecessary to spend the between-fight times preparing\\\\nitems for the next fight, but it also rarely hurts. When working for a\\\\nperfect run, save immediately after the ends of fights, not at the\\\\nbeginnings of the next ones.\\\\n\\\\nSPOILER SPACE BEFORE SPECIFIC HINTS FOR EACH FIGHT\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPER-FISH HINTS\\\\n\\\\nTrout:        This is a practice fight. Get your combos going, and make\\\\n              every move count. If you can\\\\\\'t perfect this guy, you may\\\\n              have trouble doing damage fast enough to the enemies\\\\n              that will actually fight back.\\\\n\\\\nBass:         Examining the situation and reacting appropriately will\\\\n              yield more damage faster than just attacking blindly.\\\\n\\\\nClownfish:    This enemy can be one-shotted. Think outside the box.\\\\n\\\\nCatfish:      Just because a move has done no damage doesn\\\\\\'t mean it\\\\\\'s\\\\n              not part of a combo.\\\\n\\\\nTuna:         Long, repetitive combos can end with a sizable bang.\\\\n\\\\nSwordfish:    Make your combos last as long as they possibly can. Also,\\\\n              do not run out of stamina while performing them or you\\\\n              may trigger a game-breaking bug in version 1.1.\\\\n\\\\nPufferfish:   You can\\\\\\'t touch it directly. Keep the pressure on and\\\\n              don\\\\\\'t let it close.\\\\n\\\\nShark:        This is a puzzle battle, but keep your combos in mind.\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel: Protection is available. You\\\\\\'ll need to prepare in\\\\n              advance to overcome its defenses fast enough for a\\\\n              perfect score. Fortunately, you can rest as much as you\\\\n              want before he shows up.\\\\n\\\\nPiranha:      Mix it up! You cannot safely do any move more than twice. The\\\\n              crowd\\\\\\'s chant gives you key to a flawless victory, but\\\\n              you\\\\\\'ll need to make sure your stamina is at least half\\\\n              full before you make the first move.\\\\n\\\\nAnglerfish:   In defeating the piranha, you will have improved your\\\\n              basic attack damage. For once, combos are not the whole\\\\n              of the answer, even once the puzzles are solved.\\\\n\\\\nCoelacanth:   To complete this battle as rapidly as possible, you will\\\\n              need to have satisfied your winning combination\\\\\\'s\\\\n              preconditions in advance.\\\\n\\\\nOPTIMUM COMBINATION VALUES\\\\n\\\\nThese are targets to shoot for for a maximum score. Some fights may\\\\nrequire you to prepare in advance during the inter-fight\\\\nsequences.

But we wrote the game too.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Hi, everybody, and welcome to the annotated walkthrough for Speculative Fiction! Whether you\\\\\\'re stuck in the game, or just curious to see if you missed anything, we hope this walkthrough will be a fun and educational experience! I\\\\\\'m Rory. I play W.D. in the game. \\\\nMARTIN: And I\\\\\\'m Martin. I play the wizard. \\\\nRORY: The wizard doesn\\\\\\'t officially have a name, but we like to refer to him as Bill. \\\\nMARTIN: I prefer Frederick, but we\\\\\\'re never going to agree on this one. Anyway, let\\\\\\'s get started. You begin the game in Not a---\\\\nRORY: Wait. We should explain how this works, first. This walkthrough is divided into a number of parts. \\\\n\\\\nIn Part 1, we\\\\\\'ll try to determine who we are, why we\\\\\\'re here, and what our goals are. \\\\n\\\\nIn Part 2, we\\\\\\'ll do a general exploration of the game map, and pick up any freely-available objects. \\\\n\\\\nIn Part 3, we\\\\\\'ll solve the easier puzzles. These are pretty straightforward. You\\\\\\'ll need to bring a few objects to the right location and combine them. \\\\n\\\\nIn Part 4, we\\\\\\'ll solve the harder puzzles. These puzzles have multiple stages, require timing, or both. \\\\n\\\\nIn Part 5, we\\\\\\'ll solve the endgame. Now, the endgame _is_ timed, but it\\\\\\'s also pretty simple, so this bit shouldn\\\\\\'t take too long. \\\\n\\\\nIf we have time, in Part 6 we\\\\\\'ll talk about interesting actions you may want to try, some of which will be hazardous to Bill\\\\\\'s health, or to W.D.\\\\\\'s. I should mention that this walkthrough will strive to be pretty thorough - we\\\\\\'ll mention actions a player might take even if they\\\\\\'re not strictly necessary - examining objects and such. \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: But then you\\\\\\'d miss out on all the behind-the-scenes gossip. \\\\n\\\\nPART 1: WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We begin the game in Not a Dungeon. Your first goal is to figure out what\\\\\\'s going on. \\\\n\\\\n> x me\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Ok, that\\\\\\'s kind of a strange description. You get told that your body is unconscious, but you\\\\\\'re giving commands to someone or something. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s see what else is in the room. \\\\n\\\\n> x vase\\\\n> take vase\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'ll need this vase eventually, so we\\\\\\'re going to take it now. \\\\nRORY: I really hate that vase. \\\\nMARTIN: I know, but we need it for full points. \\\\nRORY: Bleh. What else is in this room? \\\\n\\\\n> x tapestry\\\\n> x inscription\\\\n\\\\nRORY: This is just flavor, but it lets you know a little bit about the backstory. Let\\\\\\'s check out the body. \\\\n\\\\n> x body\\\\n\\\\nRORY: That\\\\\\'s the same description as \"x me\". So who\\\\\\'s driving this thing? \\\\n\\\\n> look in mirror\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And there I am! Aren\\\\\\'t I awesome? \\\\nMARTIN: As a side note, \"x you\" also describes W.D. Let\\\\\\'s examine Frederick the wizard some more.\\\\n\\\\n> x robe\\\\n> look in pockets\\\\n> take wand\\\\n> x wand\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Yay! Magic items! \\\\n\\\\n> wake wizard  \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now you have some more idea what\\\\\\'s going on. Your mind is inside W.D., giving him directions. \\\\nThe vase and the wand are the only objects you can get in the room, so it\\\\\\'s time to escape. \\\\n\\\\n> x door\\\\n> open door\\\\n\\\\nRORY: W.D. can\\\\\\'t get through the door, because he\\\\\\'s a bird. On the other hand, he\\\\\\'s a bird. \\\\n\\\\n> x window\\\\n> fly out window\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And with a big WOOOSH, W.D. is free. \"d\" doesn\\\\\\'t work to get out of the room initially, but once you\\\\\\'ve escaped for the first time, you can use \"u\" and \"d\" to go between Not a Dungeon and Castle Gate. \\\\nMARTIN: I have to say, this was probably the hardest scene in the game for me to film. You\\\\\\'d think lying there would be easy, but it\\\\\\'s really hard to be still! At least Fred\\\\\\'s only supposed to be unconscious, so I could still breathe. \\\\nRORY: There was that one session where you kept laughing. \\\\nMARTIN: You examined the tapestry thirty times in a row! Maybe Frederick was having a funny dream. \\\\nRORY: Well, his brain is in W.D.\\\\\\'s bag, so I don\\\\\\'t see how - \\\\nMARTIN: *cough* Anyway, we eventually got the scene filmed. At this point, W.D. is in Castle Gate and ready to explore the game world proper. \\\\nRORY: Unfortunately, W.D. cannot break down the doors of the castle, so the relevant thing to see here is the tree. \\\\n\\\\n> x tree\\\\n> climb tree\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: This brings us to the top of the tree. You can see a fair amount of the map from here. \\\\n\\\\n> x stall\\\\n> x castle\\\\n> x magic\\\\n> x farm\\\\n\\\\nRORY: This area\\\\\\'s here to give you a feel for the map. Note that when you examine the magic shop, W.D. says, \"We should go there to ask for advice.\"\\\\nMARTIN: There\\\\\\'s one other thing here. Don\\\\\\'t forget the note. \\\\nRORY: Right, right. \\\\n\\\\n> take note\\\\n> read note\\\\n\\\\nRORY: So one of those pesky tree-climbing humans has left a treasure hunt for his girlfriend. We\\\\\\'ll be following it later. \\\\nMARTIN: Fun fact: the models of the other game locations which you can see here? Ken in costuming made them. He makes dollhouses as a hobby. He\\\\\\'s working on a replica of the whole game world now. \\\\nRORY: Wow. I didn\\\\\\'t know that. Cool. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, I learned a lot of neat things about the crew while waiting to film my scenes. \\\\nRORY: I kind of regret not being able to hang out with people more, but I was on camera basically the whole time. Anyway, we should probably take a break from the shop talk. People are trying to win this thing. So! Mel will give us advice, so that\\\\\\'s where we should head.\\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\'re at the south part of Big Street. Mel\\\\\\'s is off of the center section. You\\\\\\'ll notice there\\\\\\'s a beggar here - \\\\n\\\\n> x beggar\\\\n\\\\nRORY: But we\\\\\\'re going to skip the beggar for now. At this point, it\\\\\\'s not entirely clear what we\\\\\\'re up to. We\\\\\\'ll come back once we have a reason to bug this guy. \\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nRORY: This is Big Street, Center. It is the greatest location in the game, because it contains Sandie\\\\\\'s Hot Meats. Tragically, we need to skip it for now and go to Mel\\\\\\'s. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The room description of the magic shop starts to explain what we\\\\\\'re doing: \"We\\\\\\'re here to ask Mel for a Midas potion.\" \\\\nRORY: Now, the very first action you take in the magic shop is going to be intercepted by a cut-scene, so we\\\\\\'ll just look at the room again. \\\\n\\\\n> l \\\\n\\\\nRORY: And here\\\\\\'s your plot dump. Now, that was a lot of text, so let me summarize:\\\\n   1.) Bill the wizard has been embezzling and just got caught. \\\\n   2.) The treasurer has to go find the king to get Bill executed.\\\\n   3.) Bill needs to fill the treasury back up before that happens. \\\\n   4.) If we get Mel lots and lots and lots of money, he will sell us the ingredients to make a potion that turns all the fake treasure in the treasury to gold.    \\\\n   5.) Profit.\\\\nMARTIN: I think that\\\\\\'s the first time I\\\\\\'ve seen one of those lists where the item before \"Profit\" isn\\\\\\'t \"???\". \\\\nRORY: Well, it\\\\\\'s, \"Get Mel lots and lots of money\", which might as well be \"???\"\\\\nMARTIN: I guess it wouldn\\\\\\'t be a game if it were obvious. So, there are a lot of things going on in this location. First, Mel speaks Raven. He\\\\\\'s the one NPC you can have real conversations with. \\\\n\\\\n> ask mel about money\\\\n> ask mel about wizard\\\\n> ask mel about wand\\\\n> ask mel about potion\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Some of these are hints, and some are just flavor. If you haven\\\\\\'t already tried waving the wand, you should do that. About half of the responses in \"ask mel about money\" actually correspond to things you can do in game. He also has opinions on many of the other NPCs. \\\\nMARTIN: Including a backhanded compliment about poor Frederick. Sniff sniff. \\\\nRORY: Also, this is where we\\\\\\'ll come back to in order to cash in completed puzzles. It\\\\\\'s also where we\\\\\\'ll make the Midas potion. That will be later, though. \\\\nMARTIN: There are also several items in the shop. The cockroaches are there to look cool. The trinkets we\\\\\\'ll deal with later. We can take the balloon now. Then we\\\\\\'ll head off to the southeast corner of the shop. \\\\nRORY: Yeah - now that we know the plot, we\\\\\\'re going to do a rapid-fire run through of the map, taking objects and looking for puzzle pointers. \\\\n\\\\nPART 2: RUN AROUND THE MAP AND TAKE STUFF\\\\n\\\\n> take balloon\\\\n> se\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The alchemy bench is full of items which aren\\\\\\'t nailed down. We\\\\\\'ll take all of them. \\\\n\\\\n> x dye\\\\n> take dye\\\\n> x clear\\\\n> take clear\\\\n> x book\\\\n> read book\\\\n> read page\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: There are three bottles of blue dye, but we\\\\\\'re going to solve the puzzles in an order such that we only need one. You can come back here if you use up or destroy a bottle. (Or you can just take all three at once.) Also, we don\\\\\\'t need the whole spellbook; just the relevant page. \\\\nRORY: The solvent actually works, if you\\\\\\'re wondering. The prop for the spellbook is now blank due to an accident with the \"clear fluid\". \\\\nMARTIN: Rory carefully neglects to mention who caused the accident. \\\\nRORY: HEY GUYS I SPILLED THE SOLVENT ON THE BOOK. ::cough:: \\\\n\\\\n> nw\\\\n> w\\\\n> s\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'re back at Big Street, South. Let\\\\\\'s check out the beggar in more detail. \\\\n\\\\n> x beggar\\\\n> x cup\\\\n> look in cup\\\\n> x strange\\\\n> take strange\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Okay, so the beggar can hear us, but not see us. He\\\\\\'s got some kind of rare coin, but we can\\\\\\'t get it from him yet. \\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n> x stall\\\\n> x sandie\\\\n> x pans\\\\n> excitement pan\\\\n> ask sandie about meat\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Sandie can\\\\\\'t speak Raven, but she does know who we are. There are a couple of NPCs who know that W.D. is a special raven and will treat him a little bit more like a person. \\\\n\\\\n> take salt\\\\n\\\\nRORY: There\\\\\\'s salt and pepper here. I\\\\\\'m cheating a bit in that I know we\\\\\\'ll need the salt and won\\\\\\'t need the pepper. But hey, that\\\\\\'s why you\\\\\\'re reading a walkthrough--- for the delicious cheating. There\\\\\\'s infinite salt here, but you can only take one packet at a time. If you use it up, you can come back to Sandie\\\\\\'s to get another packet. \\\\nMARTIN: I need to interrupt for a minute and put a plug in for Alessandra, here. She plays Sandie, and she was an absolute _delight_ to work with. She\\\\\\'s professional, she\\\\\\'s funny ... if you are trying to write a female character in your game and you need someone, I really recommend her work. \\\\nRORY: I have to second that. We tried to get her in here to help with the walkthrough, but she\\\\\\'s got a gig as an evil sorceress in a dungeon crawl right now. \\\\nMARTIN: The salt is the only thing we really need here for now, so it\\\\\\'s off towards Moneyville.\\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nRORY: This area is _mostly_ a hub. There\\\\\\'s one thing to check out:\\\\n\\\\n> x cord\\\\n> pull cord\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Well, that\\\\\\'s exciting! We\\\\\\'ll be back to deal with the cord in more detail later. Conveniently, we\\\\\\'ve been moved to the Bank Lobby. \\\\n\\\\n> x forms\\\\n> x poster\\\\n> x man\\\\n> take poster\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: All humans look kind of alike to W.D. \\\\nRORY: Which is speciesism. \\\\nMARTIN: Anyway, we can take the poster. It describes Two-Handed Bart, horrible bank robber. \\\\nRORY: \"Horrible\" because he\\\\\\'s bad at it. \\\\nMARTIN: What? No, no, the fact that he robs banks is horrible ... er, moving on.\\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> x teller\\\\n> ask teller about loan\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The teller doesn\\\\\\'t speak Raven. If we want to communicate with her, we\\\\\\'ll need another way. \\\\n\\\\n> x chandelier\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Here\\\\\\'s the cord we saw outside the bank earlier.\\\\n\\\\n> x cord\\\\n\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'ll see the cord in the guard tower too. It\\\\\\'s the bank\\\\\\'s alarm system. \\\\n\\\\n> break cord\\\\n\\\\nRORY: But we can\\\\\\'t do anything about it from here. \\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: This is the Stock Market. There\\\\\\'s an auction going on.\\\\n\\\\n> x auctioneer\\\\n> x coffer\\\\n> x merchants\\\\n\\\\nRORY: There are also a lot of animals. \\\\n\\\\n> x animals\\\\n> animals, hi\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Some of the animals are pretty nervous.\\\\nMARTIN: If you stick around for a few turns, you can watch the auctions going on. For now, there aren\\\\\\'t any objects we can take. \\\\n\\\\n> sw \\\\n> w\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Mindo Street lets us get into the guard tower, and also has a cool statue. \\\\nMARTIN: I hear the statue is actually modeled after the father of one of the writers, as a sort of cameo. \\\\nRORY: Really? I heard it was the set designer\\\\\\'s ex. \\\\nMARTIN: Huh. Well, it\\\\\\'s someone. \\\\n\\\\n> x statue\\\\n> x plaque\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Cute. Time for the guard tower. \\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n> x bell\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Here\\\\\\'s the last part of the alarm system. If you try to ring the bell from in here, you just annoy the guard. \\\\n\\\\n> x guard\\\\n> x mustache\\\\n> take mustache\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Sound sleeper. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, that\\\\\\'s artistic license. I tried that thing on. It _hurts_. \\\\n\\\\n> x wastebasket\\\\n> take vellum\\\\n> read vellum\\\\n> x signature\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Apparently Bill the Wizard was up to something other than just embezzling pre-game. \\\\nMARTIN: This letter relates to a mysterious device which we\\\\\\'ll see in a few turns.\\\\n\\\\n> x tunic\\\\n> take key\\\\n\\\\nRORY: I\\\\\\'m now going to show you the evidence cabinet and then walk you through two ways of not opening it. \\\\n\\\\n> x cabinet\\\\n> x crack\\\\n> look in crack\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You can\\\\\\'t examine the scrap and the device without opening the cabinet, which you can\\\\\\'t do yet. \\\\n\\\\n> x lock\\\\n> break lock\\\\n\\\\nRORY: That\\\\\\'s Failure 1.\\\\n\\\\n> unlock lock with key\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And that\\\\\\'s Failure 2. \\\\n\\\\n> give key to guard\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Say it with me, folks: \"We\\\\\\'ll be back to deal with this later.\" We\\\\\\'re giving the key back to the guard now because he\\\\\\'s the only person who can open the cabinet. \\\\n\\\\n> up\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now we\\\\\\'re at the barracks. We can finally take some more objects. \\\\n\\\\n> x blanket\\\\n> take blanket\\\\n> take bit\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Mmm, a smelly blanket.\\\\n\\\\n> x guard\\\\n> x forms\\\\n> x stamp\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The signature is, in fact, the treasurer\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n> x guard\\\\n> x tunic\\\\n> take pouch\\\\n> open pouch\\\\n> take florin\\\\n\\\\nRORY: They really don\\\\\\'t hire the guards for their alertness, do they? \\\\nMARTIN: The guy\\\\\\'s been stamping paperwork for sixteen hours. \\\\nRORY: I guess. As we learned with the guard downstairs, tunics contain exciting objects. This guard has ... A SINGLE FLORIN!!! Our first real money!\\\\nMARTIN: Don\\\\\\'t try to turn the florin in to Mel, though. We\\\\\\'ll need to turn one florin into many before we have anything worthwhile. \\\\nRORY: Off to the last few game locations. \\\\n\\\\n> d\\\\n> s\\\\n> w\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Ah, the sea.\\\\n\\\\n> take rod\\\\n> x rod\\\\n> wave rod\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The fishing wand generates a variety of forms of bait. \\\\n\\\\n> eat \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'re going to eat the bait to get rid of it for now. Our props deparment failed to get us duplicates of some relevant items - there\\\\\\'s only one \"salt\" and one \"faery coin\" and one \"bait\", so you won\\\\\\'t be able to get another one until you dispose of the first one. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, in an ironic twist, it turned out a certain someone was stealing from the props budget...\\\\nRORY: Legally, we can\\\\\\'t mention her name, but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Also it rhymes with \"Mendolyn\". \\\\n\\\\n> x scarecrow\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The end of that description is not a typo. \\\\n\\\\n> x hat\\\\n> take hat\\\\n\\\\nRORY: For convenience, you can refer to it as a hat. \\\\nMARTIN: So what\\\\\\'s up with the circle and the barrel? \\\\n\\\\n> read sign\\\\n> x circle\\\\n> x barrel\\\\n> take fish\\\\n> enter circle\\\\n> take fish\\\\n> eat fish\\\\n\\\\nRORY: I would like to point out that I am claustrophobic and this was not fun to film. I\\\\\\'m going to go get some air. Martin, you deal with this bit. \\\\nMARTIN: Ok. So W.D. is trapped in a magical cage. \\\\n\\\\n> x cage\\\\n> open cage\\\\n> e\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: It doesn\\\\\\'t open on its own. (We filmed a scene where if you waited for twenty turns, a fisherman would come and throw you into the ocean. That got cut for being too gruesome.) Violence turns out to be the solution to this one. \\\\n\\\\n> break cage\\\\n> break cage\\\\n> break cage\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: W.D. can break out in 1 to 3 turns, so you may have to try multiple times. Now we have a treacherous source of fish. \\\\n\\\\n> exit circle\\\\n> e\\\\n> sw \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, Rory - we\\\\\\'re at the Farmland. You can come back. Rory? Hrm. From the farmland, we can go into the cottage or over to the barn. There\\\\\\'s also a hedgehog. \\\\n\\\\n> x hedgehog\\\\n> hedgehog, hi\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The hedgehog and W.D. can understand each other, but communication is still difficult. The notable thing here is that the hedgehog is hungry. \\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: If you\\\\\\'ve played the Introcomp release, you probably remember the cottage. In the full game, there\\\\\\'s a second room further to the south. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\'s check out the fireplace. We can ignore the farming tools. \\\\n\\\\n> x fireplace\\\\n> x chimney\\\\n> take brick\\\\n> take parchment\\\\n> x parchment\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: If you remember all the way back to \"ask mel about money\", he does happen to mention insurance fraud. \\\\n\\\\n> x scarf\\\\n> take scarf\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Fashion!\\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> x basket\\\\n> x lever\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: W.D. has a serious egg problem.\\\\n\\\\n> take egg\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Really serious. \\\\n\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n> take egg\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: _Really_ serious. There are an infinite number of eggs and W.D. has infinite stomach capacity. Hm. Is Rory back? No? Rory got _really_ sick doing this scene. Rory does not have infinite stomach capacity. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> n\\\\n> w\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: This brings us to the barn, which is the final location in the main map. Here we have a beautiful, brand-new building, which we now know was just insured for some amount of money, hopefully a large amount. Our path is clear. \\\\nRORY: I\\\\\\'m back! I brought coffee. I got you a latte. \\\\nMARTIN: Thanks, Rory. Also, good timing. I was just about to start solving puzzles. \\\\nRORY: Awesome. Time to burn down the barn? \\\\nMARTIN: Time to burn down the barn. \\\\n\\\\nPART 3: TIME TO BURN DOWN THE BARN, AND OTHER SIMPLE PUZZLES\\\\n\\\\nRORY: If you\\\\\\'ve jumped straight to Part 3, we\\\\\\'re at the Barn. \\\\n\\\\n> x hay\\\\n\\\\nRORY: This hay is very dry. It would be a shame if something happened to it. \\\\nMARTIN: Now, we don\\\\\\'t directly have a fire source, but if you examine our vast pile of objects, we do have an explosion source. \\\\nRORY: (If you haven\\\\\\'t already waved the magic wand to get a faery coin, you should do that now.) \\\\n\\\\n> wave wand\\\\n> take coin\\\\n> x coin\\\\n> x salt\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Faery coins explode if you put salt on them. We have salt. Now, it\\\\\\'s not a very big explosion; don\\\\\\'t go thinking you can blow off the castle doors. But this hay is quite dry ... \\\\n\\\\n> put faery on hay\\\\n> put salt on faery\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And now we _leave_. \\\\nMARTIN: If you\\\\\\'re feeling suicidal, you can stand there and watch W.D. burn to death, but we like winning. \\\\nRORY: And in case you\\\\\\'re worrying that I have a poor charred stunt double somewhere, _that_ scene was CGI. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: In your playthrough, we encourage you to stop at Farmland and watch the barn burn down, but we\\\\\\'re going to get a move on. \\\\nRORY: This next bit is different from Introcomp. In the initial release, there was an insurance salesman at the stock market who you could turn the policy into. Now you\\\\\\'ll need to turn it in at the bank. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> n\\\\n> n\\\\n> n\\\\n> e\\\\n> e\\\\n> give parchment to teller\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Yay money!\\\\nMARTIN: I\\\\\\'m going to walk you through giving the check to Mel now. This will teach you about buying ingredients. After this, we\\\\\\'ll just hold them till the end. \\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> w\\\\n> s\\\\n> e\\\\n> give check to mel\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now you\\\\\\'ve gotten the right to buy one ingredient. For full points, you\\\\\\'ll need to buy all seven. You can win the game starting with the four-ingredient potion. \\\\nRORY: If you are playing the game on your own and not just following the walkthrough, we recommend not buying any ingredients until you\\\\\\'ve given up on puzzles. \\\\nMARTIN: Right. The five-ingredient potion needs a different set from the four-ingredient potion. So you don\\\\\\'t want to buy three ingredients and then realize they\\\\\\'re only useful if you manage to finish all seven puzzles. \\\\n\\\\n> buy ingredient\\\\n> midas potion\\\\n\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'re actually saying \"Midas potion\" here because that backs you out of the buying dialog. We\\\\\\'ve successfully gotten the check out of our inventory; we\\\\\\'ll buy all seven ingredients at once later. \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\'ll do Puzzle 2: The Riddle Trail.\\\\nRORY: This is the puzzle connected to the red note. Each note clues a location in the game. You go there and get the next note. Repeat. \\\\n\\\\n> read red note\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'re told to go to the left elbow of Blue Fever\\\\\\'s brother. If you\\\\\\'ll recall, Blue Fever is mentioned on the plaque underneath the statue on Mindo Street. \\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n \\\\n> w\\\\n> x left elbow\\\\n> take violet note\\\\n> read violet note\\\\n\\\\nRORY: We saw forms in the bank.\\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> e\\\\n> search forms for x1-fsb\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The treasure hunt involves a couple of uses of \"search X for Y\".\\\\nRORY: This is about two hundred commands too late, but if you haven\\\\\\'t tried \"ABOUT\" by now, it points you to\"ABOUT VERBS\", which lists some verbs you might not otherwise think to try. \\\\n\\\\n> take green note\\\\n> read green note\\\\n\\\\nRORY: There is only one place in town that contains pans of meat. You\\\\\\'ll notice the note doesn\\\\\\'t specify which kind of meat is the favorite, but there are only three options. \\\\nMARTIN: Also, it\\\\\\'s the pork pan, to save you two commands. \\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> s\\\\n> look under pork pan\\\\n> take yellow note\\\\n> read yellow note\\\\n\\\\nRORY: I am sorry to say that the only purpose the Exploding Cockroaches serve in this game is to point you back to Mel\\\\\\'s via this note. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, this was a missed opportunity. One of the script editors said there were plans for a big bug race, but, you know, budget issues...\\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> search trinkets for cedar\\\\n> take cedar\\\\n> open cedar\\\\n> take ring\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'re bad people. \\\\nRORY: It\\\\\\'s in a pile of things in a store. What\\\\\\'s to say someone completely innocent didn\\\\\\'t buy it by accident? Also, yeah, we\\\\\\'re bad people. \\\\n\\\\n> give ring to mel \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Might as well get rid of the ring, since we\\\\\\'re right here. \\\\nRORY: We actually talked about this at the cast party and we decided that Mel is totally on to you and just doesn\\\\\\'t care. \\\\nMARTIN: Well, Mel is _actually_ good at magic. What\\\\\\'s going to happen to him? Maybe he\\\\\\'ll have to turn a couple of guards into toads or something. \\\\nRORY: All right. Time for the last two simple puzzles. Conveniently, they both involve the same location. Off to rob the bank. \\\\nMARTIN: It\\\\\\'s funnier if we do it in the other order. \\\\nRORY: Hm. Good point. Okay, Puzzle 3: Two-Handed Bart.\\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n\\\\n> e\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'re back in the bank lobby. \\\\n\\\\n> x poster\\\\n> x man\\\\n\\\\nRORY: W.D. thinks the guy looks a little like Two-Handed Bart. \\\\nMARTIN: He\\\\\\'s _not_ Two-Handed Bart, but that\\\\\\'s irrelevant. \\\\nRORY: The poster describes Bart. He\\\\\\'s got shiny hair, a handlebar mustache, and a green scarf. Our man has a hat on, a wispy mustache, and no scarf. So we need to fix that. \\\\n\\\\n> x scarf\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Hm. It\\\\\\'s yellow. Wrong color. \\\\n\\\\n> x dye\\\\n> dye scarf\\\\n> give scarf to man\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Okay. One down. He\\\\\\'s got the wrong kind of mustache, but we can fix this. \\\\n\\\\n> x mustache\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: ... W.D. may interrupt you here. \\\\n\\\\n> x mustache\\\\n> wind mustache\\\\n> wind mustache\\\\n\\\\nRORY: You may have to wind it more or fewer times to get it into the right shape. You want the handlebar mustache.\\\\n\\\\n> give mustache to man\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'re nearly done, but we have to get rid of the hat. Disambiguation here - you can refer to his hat as \"fedora\" and skip the \"do you \\\\n\\\\nmean the unhat or the hat or the fedora or the ordinary man\" ridiculousness that you get sometimes. \\\\n\\\\n> take fedora\\\\n\\\\nRORY: He won\\\\\\'t let us take the hat. This is okay, though, because we have the essence of anti-hat. \\\\n\\\\n> put unhat on man\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Okay, now we\\\\\\'re good. We just have to summon the guard ...\\\\n\\\\n> w\\\\n> pull cord\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now we need to collect the reward. \\\\n\\\\n> w \\\\n> w \\\\n> n\\\\n> show poster to guard\\\\n\\\\nRORY: More treasure for us! And now we\\\\\\'re in the right place to start robbing the bank. \\\\n\\\\n> x evidence \\\\n> look in crack\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You can see there are now more things in the evidence cabinet. Who knows where Two-Handed Bart has gone? \\\\nRORY: All right. We need to blow open this cabinet. Where have we seen explosions before? \\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n> e\\\\n> s\\\\n> get salt\\\\n> n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Darn you, Mendolyn! All right, we\\\\\\'ve gotten more salt from Sandie. \\\\n\\\\n> wave wand\\\\n> get faery\\\\n> put faery in crack\\\\n> put salt in crack\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now in some sense this is Failure #3, because the door stays on, but it alerts the guard, which is good enough. \\\\n\\\\n> z\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Come on, man, wake up. \\\\n\\\\n> z \\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now we have one turn to grab things. \\\\n\\\\n> get scrap from cabinet\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You can duplicate these steps and try to grab the device, but we\\\\\\'re not going to do that here, because it doesn\\\\\\'t actually work. The device is too bulky and the guard will notice you. There\\\\\\'s another way to get the device, which we\\\\\\'ll talk about in the next section. \\\\nRORY: I dropped that thing on my claws at least twice. \\\\nMARTIN: Hey, it was an authentically heavy prop. No cardboard boulders for us. \\\\nRORY: Oy. Anyway, what the heck does this scrap even say? \\\\n\\\\n> x scrap\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, some bozo tried to rob the bank! \\\\nRORY: Hey, look! A note! We don\\\\\\'t need to speak People if we have a _note_!\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, Rory, do you like crime? \\\\nRORY: Hell yeah, I like me some crime. Let\\\\\\'s robbinate. \\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n> e\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now, as you may recall from the previous puzzle, _there is an alarm system_. \\\\n\\\\n> break cord\\\\n\\\\nRORY: But I\\\\\\'m awesome, so whatever. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> e \\\\n> show scrap to teller\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: And now W.D. is the King of Moneyville. Good job. \\\\n\\\\nPART 4: THE HARD PUZZLES\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Technically, you can win the game now; four puzzles is the minimum necessary. You can skip down to Part 5 if you want that. But now it\\\\\\'s time for the good stuff. \\\\nMARTIN: Puzzle 5: Robbing the Blind involves several parts and requires doing a timed event correctly. \\\\nRORY: So we have this blind beggar in Big Street, South. He can\\\\\\'t see you but he can hear you. So you need to make a really loud distraction so that you can steal the coin without him noticing. \\\\nMARTIN: Now, there is a place in the game that\\\\\\'s very loud. It\\\\\\'s the one place in the game where \"listen\" does something special. \\\\n\\\\n> w \\\\n> n\\\\n> listen\\\\n\\\\nRORY: As W.D. says, the stock market is a zoo. Somewhat ... literally, I guess. These animals would be _really loud_ if we could get them to the beggar. \\\\nMARTIN: We have a bunch of barely controlled animals, and we need to get them from Point A to Point Not A. We need to startle them, and then nature will take its course. \\\\nRORY: Its chaotic, chaotic course. \\\\nMARTIN: Right. Everybody loves a stampede. So we need a loud noise to startle the animals. \\\\nRORY: Hey, wait, you\\\\\\'re going to send them on the wrong track. You can\\\\\\'t use the coin-and-salt trick here. The coin isn\\\\\\'t actually loud. It\\\\\\'s just bright. \\\\nMARTIN: Ah, yes. You want less \"explode\" and more \"pop\". \\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'re going for the balloon, if that\\\\\\'s not clear. \\\\nMARTIN: But you also shouldn\\\\\\'t try to pop the balloon yourself. Standing in front of a stampede when it starts isn\\\\\\'t very safe. (Feel free to try it and then \"undo\", if you like.) \\\\nRORY: Now, you need someone _else_ to pop the balloon for you. \\\\nMARTIN: Someone who might pop the balloon accidentally. \\\\nRORY: Right. Someone kind of ... pointy.\\\\nMARTIN: DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! \\\\nRORY: ... \\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n> w\\\\n> w\\\\n> sw\\\\n> ask hedgehog about stampede\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, asking the hedgehog about a stampede won\\\\\\'t really work. You can\\\\\\'t actually get a word in edgewise with the hedghog. \\\\nRORY: I think you mean _hedgewise_, amirite amirite? \\\\nMARTIN: Did you get an Irish coffee, by any chance? \\\\nRORY: Hey, it was funny!\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Reader, I know this is text, but I promise you I\\\\\\'m glaring at Rory. Anyhoo, no matter what you try to say to the hedgehog, he just \\\\n\\\\nobsessively asks for food and tells you how pointy he is. \\\\n\\\\n> hedgehog, go east\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: And you can\\\\\\'t give him orders. \\\\n\\\\n> show balloon to hedgehog\\\\n\\\\nRORY: But he _does_ like toys. \\\\nMARTIN: We don\\\\\\'t want to give him the balloon right away, because he\\\\\\'ll be completely engrossed once he gets it. So let\\\\\\'s go drop the balloon where we need it, and then come back. \\\\n\\\\n> nw\\\\n> e\\\\n> ne\\\\n> drop balloon\\\\n> sw\\\\n> w\\\\n> sw\\\\n\\\\nRORY: All right. The hedgehog won\\\\\\'t do anything we want. I guess we\\\\\\'re forced to _listen_ to him. Let\\\\\\'s feed him. \\\\n\\\\n> wave rod\\\\n\\\\nRORY: You may recall that the fishing rod creates insects. Hedgehogs are insectivores, if you didn\\\\\\'t know. You can also give him fish, but the fish are a pain to get. As soon as you wave the fishing rod, the hedghog will snarf the bait. \\\\n\\\\n> nw\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And he\\\\\\'ll follow you. You\\\\\\'ll need to keep feeding him every few turns to keep him following you. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> wave rod\\\\n> ne\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\'ve dragged the hedgehog to the stock market. He will start playing with the balloon. Now you need to book it to Big Street, South. The hedgehog will pop the balloon in a random but low number of turns. \\\\n\\\\n> sw\\\\n> s\\\\n> s\\\\n\\\\nRORY: From here, wait until the stampede actually hits this location...\\\\n\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You may need more or fewer than three turns.\\\\nRORY: Then grab the coin!\\\\n\\\\n> get strange\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Yoink!\\\\nMARTIN: If you don\\\\\\'t want to try to time your waiting, you can also just type \"get strange\" repeatedly and when it works, it works. \\\\nRORY: The kid who plays the hedgehog was eight, in case you were wondering. So the screechy singing is authentic. \\\\nMARTIN: He was a good kid. He was just really boisterous. \\\\nRORY: And we\\\\\\'d like to point out that no actual animals were harmed in this. Just fake ones. We hear that our hedgehog actor went back to school and has been excitedly telling everyone that he got flattened by a cow in his first acting job.  \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now it\\\\\\'s time for Puzzle 6: The Mysterious Device.\\\\nRORY: If this phrase means anything to you, this is Speculative Fiction\\\\\\'s version of the Babelfish puzzle. \\\\nMARTIN: The puzzle has a lot of steps and it\\\\\\'s easy to break things at any step, so be prepared to restart it a lot.\\\\nRORY: You shouldn\\\\\\'t have to undo or restore save games. But you might find it easier to \"undo\" than to run back to grab items again. \\\\nMARTIN: First, let\\\\\\'s grab the device. We know from an earlier puzzle that you can drop a faery coin and some salt into the crack in the evidence cabinet, and that will cause a guard to open the cabinet for a turn. But the device is big and bulky, and the guard will stop you from taking it. \\\\nRORY: So we need to get the device \"legitimately.\" We\\\\\\'ve been carrying around this vellum page which is some kind of requisition form for the device. \\\\n\\\\n> n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n\\\\n> show vellum to guard\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The guard isn\\\\\\'t impressed. And he tears up our form. That jerk! Frederick tried this trick a lot, though, so we\\\\\\'ll just get another one. \\\\n\\\\n> look in wastebasket\\\\n> take vellum\\\\n> read vellum\\\\n> x signature\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The major problem here is the signature. Even W.D. knows it\\\\\\'s a bad forgery. Even the idiot downstairs knows it\\\\\\'s a bad forgery. We gotta do better than this. Let\\\\\\'s start over.\\\\n\\\\n> x clear\\\\n> pour clear on signature\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Now we have an unsigned sheet of paper, and a very sleepy civil servant with a stamp. \\\\n\\\\n> u\\\\n> put vellum on stack\\\\n> z\\\\n> take vellum\\\\n> read vellum\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: That\\\\\\'s better. It\\\\\\'s an official stamp! Who can disagree with an official stamp?\\\\n\\\\n> d\\\\n> give vellum to guard\\\\n\\\\nRORY: I feel like many problems in this world were caused by the city guards not caring. \\\\nMARTIN: Nononoo. You\\\\\\'re looking at it wrong. Many problems are _solved_ by the city guards not caring. Besides, there\\\\\\'s that one guard from the ransom job. He knows it\\\\\\'s not really Two-Handed Bart. \\\\nRORY: Maybe Bill and him will team up in the sequel or something. \\\\nMARTIN: Speculative Fiction 2: This Time It\\\\\\'s Personal.\\\\nRORY: Yeah, so we have this device. \\\\n\\\\n> x device\\\\n> x tray\\\\n> push green button\\\\n> push blue button\\\\n> push red button\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Oooh, oooh, maybe it\\\\\\'s an instruction manual...\\\\n\\\\n> take pamphlet\\\\n> read pamphlet\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Er, well ... kind of. So the device needs:\\\\n   1.) Some wool\\\\n   2.) A bottle of blue dye, in the bottle\\\\n   3.) An unbroken egg\\\\nYou put objects in the tray and press the blue button to load them. Then you press the green button to get money. \\\\nRORY: Well, we have wool. \\\\n\\\\n> put wool on tray\\\\n> push blue button\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: And we have blue dye. \\\\n\\\\n> put blue dye on tray\\\\n> push blue button\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now we just need an egg! This puzzle is easy!\\\\nRORY AND MARTIN: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, as you may recall, W.D. is basically a black hole when it comes to eggs. So we have to somehow get an egg into this machine without W.D. being able to eat it. \\\\n\\\\nRORY: Let\\\\\\'s go back to the egg dispenser. \\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n> sw\\\\n> s\\\\n> w\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We already know he immediately eats the egg. Maybe we can put the egg into a container? \\\\n\\\\n> put vase in basket\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, the egg breaks, which isn\\\\\\'t useful. However, you\\\\\\'ll notice W.D. can\\\\\\'t get the egg while it\\\\\\'s inside the vase, which is useful. \\\\nRORY: The machine won\\\\\\'t accept a broken egg, so let\\\\\\'s get rid of it. \\\\n\\\\n> break vase\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> take vase\\\\n\\\\nRORY: The vase is magic. It reappears five turns after it disappears, so you can \\\\nMARTIN: Maaaaaybe we can cushion it? \\\\nRORY: What do we have that\\\\\\'s soft? We just used up the blanket bit. \\\\nMARTIN: And the whole blanket wouldn\\\\\\'t fit anyway. Hey, you know what was soft? That scarf we gave to Two-Handed Bart. \\\\nRORY: But Two-Handed Bart got disappeared! \\\\nMARTIN: But his stuff ended up in the evidence locker. \\\\nRORY: So ... back to the salt mines?\\\\n \\\\n> e\\\\n> n\\\\n> e\\\\n> n\\\\n> n\\\\n> take salt\\\\n> n\\\\n> w\\\\n> n\\\\n> wave wand\\\\n> take faery\\\\n> put faery in crack\\\\n> put salt in crack\\\\n> z\\\\n> z\\\\n> get scarf\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Phew. I\\\\\\'m tired just reading that. \\\\nRORY: But we have the scarf!\\\\n\\\\n> put scarf in vase\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Note that the scarf is still sticking out a little. So if you are doing this puzzle before the ransom puzzle, you can get it back out. \\\\nMARTIN: The vase is notable in that it\\\\\\'s \"very narrow\". W.D. can\\\\\\'t get his head in there. \\\\nRORY: And once there\\\\\\'s an egg in there, he\\\\\\'ll be too blinded by its holy egginess to think of tipping the vase over. \\\\nMARTIN: You\\\\\\'re forgetting your own lines, Rory. W.D. tries to tip over the vase but the egg gets stuck. \\\\nRORY: Grrr. I resent the implication that birds are this stupid.\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, I spend the whole game lying on a stone floor. \\\\nRORY: What about the endgame? \\\\nMARTIN: Okay, okay, two minutes of glory. ANYWAY...\\\\n\\\\n> s\\\\n> sw\\\\n> s\\\\n> w\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Back in the Pantry.\\\\n\\\\n> put vase in basket\\\\n> pull lever\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now we have a vase with an egg in it, and W.D. can\\\\\\'t get at the egg. \\\\nMARTIN: But there\\\\\\'s going to be a problem at the other end. We\\\\\\'ll have to take the egg out of the vase and then W.D. will eat it. \\\\nRORY: So we\\\\\\'ll have to keep him from getting at the egg a different way. \\\\nMARTIN: To get the egg initially, we had to put it into a container. To get rid of the egg, we\\\\\\'ll have to put W.D. in a ... container.\\\\nRORY: Let\\\\\\'s go back to the device. \\\\n\\\\n> take vase\\\\n> e\\\\n> n\\\\n> nw\\\\n> n\\\\n> take device\\\\n> s\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The device is too heavy for W.D. to carry. But he can push it. \\\\n\\\\n> drop device\\\\n> push device s\\\\n> push device w\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: This has got to make an extremely strange sight for any passerby. \"Hm, there\\\\\\'s a bird pushing a metal box and frantically trying to stick its head in a vase.\" \\\\nRORY: I really hope I get cast in a dramatic role someday. \\\\n\\\\n> take scarf\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\'ll need to remove the scarf from the vase or else the device will reject the egg. \\\\n\\\\n> put vase on tray\\\\n> get device\\\\n> enter circle\\\\n> drop device\\\\n\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'ll also need to remove the vase from the egg. W.D. is ::grumble:: apparently too \"bird-brained\" to think of this one himself. \\\\nMARTIN: Note the timing here. You have to take the fish the turn before you free the egg, or else W.D. will have time to eat it. \\\\n\\\\n> take fish\\\\n> break vase\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Sproing! Now W.D. can\\\\\\'t reach the egg, \\\\\\'cause he\\\\\\'s in the cage. \\\\n\\\\n> push blue button\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Of course, W.D. also can\\\\\\'t reach the button that will get rid of the egg...\\\\nMARTIN: Ha ha, but Frederick the wizard, tool-using mammal, will save the day!\\\\n\\\\n> push blue button with wand\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Now the egg\\\\\\'s gone and you can get W.D. out of the cage.\\\\n\\\\n> break cage\\\\n> break cage\\\\n> break cage\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: At some point, the vase will reform itself. Surprise. It\\\\\\'s magic. \\\\n\\\\n> push green button\\\\n> take counterfeit\\\\n> exit circle\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Regardless of what the machine says, Mel will accept this money. \\\\nMARTIN: In theory we could go get another egg and another bottle of dye, but the blanket represents the only wool in the entire kingdom, so we\\\\\\'re done here. \\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\'re ready for the last of the pre-endgame puzzles. Puzzle 7: Playing the Stock Market.\\\\nMARTIN: This is a two-stage puzzle. In the first stage, you\\\\\\'ll need to crack the mystery of the merchants and successfully buy a stock. In the second stage, you\\\\\\'ll need to artificially inflate the price of the stock you just bought. \\\\nRORY: It\\\\\\'s now finally time to deal with the merchants. \\\\n\\\\n> e\\\\n> e\\\\n> ne\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: The merchants are immune to stampedes, by the way. A wizard did it. \\\\nRORY: But not you. You\\\\\\'re incompetent. \\\\nMARTIN: Mel probably did it. \\\\nRORY: If you haven\\\\\\'t already examined the merchants...\\\\n\\\\n> x merchants\\\\n\\\\nRORY: ... will cause W.D. to assign them names. You\\\\\\'ll need to be able to disambiguate them. \\\\nMARTIN: Here we have eight merchants, and an auctioneer selling stock in various animals. If you wait for enough turns, you\\\\\\'ll see that different stocks sell for different amounts of money. Every bid doubles the price of a stock. Bidding starts at one florin. You have one florin. \\\\nRORY: Each merchant cares about a different attribute. You\\\\\\'ll need to figure out what each merchant likes and dislikes, and then pick a stock which no merchant wants. You\\\\\\'ll be able to buy that stock for a single florin. \\\\nMARTIN: The auctioneer randomly selects animals, but will never select the animal that\\\\\\'s the puzzle solution. You can, however, suggest stocks to him with \"search coffer for \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\". \\\\n\\\\n> search coffer for dog\\\\n\\\\nRORY: You may have to enter this command a couple of times; the auctioneer only takes suggestions right as one auction is ending. \"dog\" isn\\\\\\'t the answer, by the way; it\\\\\\'s just an example.\\\\nMARTIN: You can bid via \"buy certificate with florin\", but any other merchant can outbid you. \\\\n\\\\n> buy certificate with florin\\\\n\\\\nRORY: If you examine the individual merchants, you can get a vague hint as to what they like. \\\\n\\\\n> x rupertina\\\\n> x sunshine\\\\n> x fnyrx\\\\n> x elspeth\\\\n> x percival\\\\n> x demonspoon\\\\n> x rombert\\\\n> x hortensia\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Also as another hint, two of the merchants care about the attributes of the animals themselves. The other six care about attributes of the _names_ of the animals. \\\\nMARTIN: So this is mostly a word puzzle. \\\\nRORY: For the record, we didn\\\\\\'t know about any of this ourselves. The writers gave us a list.\\\\nMARTIN: There are some _hilarious_ outtakes of the merchants trying to remember their lines. \\\\nRORY: \"One!\" \"Four!\" \"Six! No, wait, three! Wait, do I even like cows?\" \\\\nMARTIN: The crew laughed for a good five minutes. \\\\n\\\\nALESSANDRA: What\\\\\\'s up, home fries? \\\\nRORY: Alessandra?! You came! \\\\nMARTIN: I thought you were filming!\\\\nALESSANDRA: We had to wrap early. Fatal bug - turned out you could \"take\" the dragon. \\\\nMARTIN: Ooooh. Classic blunder. \\\\nRORY: Hey, now that you\\\\\\'re hee, want to read the merchant list? \\\\nALESSANDRA: Uh, sure. Lessee...\\\\n   One only likes land animals (including amphibians)\\\\n   One only likes animals with legs\\\\n   One only likes animals who don\\\\\\'t have any doubled letters in their names\\\\n   One only likes animals with five or fewer letters in their names\\\\n   One only likes animals with nine or greater letters in their names\\\\n   One only likes animals with an even number of letters in their names\\\\n   One only likes animals whose names cannot be beheaded to form a new word. \"So crow is bad because if you take off the c you get row, but dog is good because if you take off the d you don\\\\\\'t get a word.\" \\\\n   One only likes animals whose names cannot have their third letter changed to form a new word. \"So dog is bad because you can change the g and get dot, but snake is good because snike or snoke or whatever aren\\\\\\'t words.\" \\\\n\\\\n   ... What? \\\\n\\\\nRORY: Thanks, Alessandra. \\\\nALESSANDRA: Was this from the stock puzzle? I didn\\\\\\'t really see it because I spent the whole time in Big Street, Center. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah. I didn\\\\\\'t really see it either. I just heard about it later. \\\\nRORY: We should give them the actual answer. \\\\nMARTIN: Right. Alessandra? \\\\nALESSANDRA: Okay, wait, I lost my place ... Ah. You know from the two lengths that you want an animal whose name is between six and eight letters. From the even merchant, you know you want a seven letter name. From the land animal and leg animal merchants, you know you want a sea creature. You also know it must have a doubled letter, that it must form a new word if you change the third letter, and that the last six letters must spell a word. The answer is herring. \\\\nMARTIN: Okay, knowing all that, you still have to enter the right commands: \\\\n\\\\n> search coffer for herring\\\\n> give florin to auctioneer\\\\n> z\\\\n\\\\nRORY: I think we may have said this before, but you can only suggest a stock right as one auction is ending, so you might have to time the \\\\n\"search coffer for herring\" command right. Nothing bad happens if you try it at the wrong time; it just doesn\\\\\\'t work. \\\\nMARTIN: Ta-da! Now you\\\\\\'ve done part one of the puzzle. \\\\nALESSANDRA: That was part ONE?\\\\nMARTIN: Well, in some sense that was part 2. Part 1 was getting the florin, although that isn\\\\\\'t too hard. \\\\nALESSANDRA: Clearly I missed a lot by staying in the meats stall. \\\\nRORY: Once you\\\\\\'ve bought your share of Consolidated Herring Securities, the merchants go off to have coffee and the auctioneer sets up a stock ticker. Now you get to play with another mysterious device. \\\\nMARTIN: Right. The stock certificate you have now isn\\\\\\'t worth anything. You\\\\\\'ll have to hack the ticker to convince the auctioneer that it\\\\\\'s \\\\n\\\\nvaluable, and then sell it back to him. \\\\n \\\\n> x ticker\\\\n> push red button\\\\n> push yellow button\\\\n> z \\\\n\\\\nRORY: Pushing the red button spits out some mysterious text, and pushing the yellow button causes the stock ticker to start displaying stock \\\\n\\\\nvalues. If you wait a few turns, you\\\\\\'ll see it rotates through the same five stocks. \\\\n\\\\n> x panel\\\\n> open panel  \\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Inside the device you\\\\\\'ll find six colored wires and six places you can plug those wires in. \\\\nALESSANDRA: I\\\\\\'m getting a headache. Goodnight, guys. \\\\nRORY: Aw. \\\\nMARTIN: Any time, Alessandra. \\\\nRORY: Again, aw. All right. Let\\\\\\'s finish this puzzle. \\\\n\\\\n> disconnect black wossname\\\\n> z\\\\n\\\\nRORY: You can see the stock ticker\\\\\\'s display has changed. If you push the red button again: \\\\n\\\\n> push red button\\\\n\\\\nRORY: You can see that\\\\\\'s changed too. \\\\nMARTIN: The wires somehow connect the incoming stock data to the external display. \\\\nRORY: Where the \"incoming stock data\" is coming in through magic or something. \\\\n\\\\n> disconnect brown wossname\\\\n> connect black wossname to brown receptacle\\\\n> connect brown wossname to black receptacle\\\\n> push red button\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You can see the ordering of the alphabet has changed. So now the input data\\\\\\'s been warped and the ticker\\\\\\'s displaying a different set of stocks. \\\\nRORY: According to the notes which the writers gave us, the device is using a six bit input - each of the letters and numbers corresponds to a six-bit number. By swapping the wires around, you change what letters and numbers the device displays. \\\\nMARTIN: You can keep changing wires and checking the red button until you get the alphabet in an order you like. But here\\\\\\'s the answer: \\\\n\\\\n> disconnect black wossname\\\\n> disconnect brown wossname\\\\n> disconnect red wossname\\\\n> disconnect orange wossname\\\\n> disconnect yellow wossname\\\\n> connect orange wossname to yellow receptacle\\\\n> connect yellow wossname to orange receptacle\\\\n> connect black wossname to red receptacle\\\\n> connect brown wossname to black receptacle\\\\n> connect red wossname to brown receptacle\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: You can leave the green wossname - er, wire - in place. \\\\nRORY: At this point the ticker will tell you that CHS (Consolidated Herring Securities) is up 37, um, units. \\\\n\\\\n> give certificate to auctioneer\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: And ... that\\\\\\'s the seven main-game puzzles. \\\\nRORY: LET\\\\\\'S TAKE THIS TRAIN TO THE ENDGAME.\\\\n\\\\nPART 5: THE ENDGAME\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Okay, so there\\\\\\'s one and a half endgames. First we have to give all the ingredients to Mel and go make the potion. This part is not timed. \\\\n\\\\n> sw\\\\n> s\\\\n> e\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Back to Mel\\\\\\'s. \\\\n\\\\n> give sovereign to mel\\\\n> give sack to mel\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Once you give Mel four treasures, which will be now if you\\\\\\'re following the walkthrough, Mel will unlock a secret trapdoor in the floor. This will let you go down to the \"sekkrit laboratory\" and make the potion. \\\\nRORY: Mel unlocks the trapdoor at four treasures because that\\\\\\'s the minimum you need to make a potion which won\\\\\\'t get you killed. So you can stop at four or keep going for more points. \\\\nMARTIN: We, of course, want more points. \\\\n\\\\n> give banknote to mel \\\\n> give reward money to mel\\\\n> give strange coin to mel\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Make sure to check the recipes before you start buying things. \\\\n\\\\n> buy all ingredients\\\\n\\\\nRORY: If you haven\\\\\\'t solved all seven potions, you can do \"buy \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\" with a specific name. The page you got from the alchemy bench will give you the list of options. Or \"buy ingredient\" will _also_ give you the list of options. \\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\'ll save our game and go downstairs. I\\\\\\'m specifically suggesting saving now because you can get different endings depending on which potion you make. \\\\n\\\\n> save\\\\n> whatever pick a save name\\\\n> d\\\\n\\\\nRORY: And now we\\\\\\'re in the secret laboratory.\\\\n\\\\n> x sign\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Did we mention to save your game? \\\\n\\\\n> x pot\\\\n> x liquid\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Here we have the potion-o-matic. Now. Do NOT add anything to the pot that is not part of one of the potion recipes. You won\\\\\\'t get it back and you\\\\\\'ll ruin any potion you have in progress.\\\\n\\\\n> put kidney in pot\\\\n> put whiskey in pot\\\\n> put starmetal in pot\\\\n> put ash in pot\\\\n> put blood in pot\\\\n> put runestone in pot\\\\n> put fur in pot\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Alternatively, use \"put all ingredients in pot\". \\\\nRORY: Nearly there...\\\\n\\\\n> press sigil\\\\n> i\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: There\\\\\\'s a potion! W.D. will tell you to go back to your body. Well, W.D. will tell you to tell him to take him and your mind back to your body. \\\\n\\\\n> u\\\\n> w\\\\n> s\\\\n> s\\\\n> u\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Oh no! NOT ANOTHER CUT SCENE!\\\\nMARTIN: And now we\\\\\\'re at the \"real\" endgame. This part is timed. You\\\\\\'ll only need three turns to finish, though.\\\\nRORY: Now, if you don\\\\\\'t have a valid potion, you are going to die. I hope you saved when we told you to. \\\\nMARTIN: We start at the bottom of the tower. The treasurer will take a few turns to get the lift started. W.D. can just fly up. \\\\n\\\\n> u\\\\n> n\\\\n\\\\nRORY: Everything in the vault is a mess. \\\\n\\\\n> x logs\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: These are the logs which Frederick the wizard put here so that the Perfectly Foolproof Illusion could have some objects to work on. \\\\nRORY: Now, you have two options. One, you could: \\\\n\\\\n> pour potion on logs\\\\n\\\\nRORY: ... and watch that ending. Or, you could \"z\" until W.D. says \"Uh oh. They\\\\\\'re here.\" Then...\\\\n\\\\n> pour potion on treasurer\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Obviously, the latter option only works if you have the full Midas potion. \\\\nRORY: You\\\\\\'ll get a winning ending with \"pour potion on logs\" for any potion that required at least four ingredients. \\\\n\\\\nPART 6: CRAZY ACTIONS YOU SHOULD DO SO SOMEONE SEES ALL OF THIS TEXT DEAR GOD WE INTENDED FOR THIS GAME TO BE SHORT\\\\n\\\\nMARTIN: Once you\\\\\\'ve won, you should check \"AMUSING\" for some random fun things you can do in the game. \\\\n\\\\nRORY: My personal recommendation is that you put the costuming parts on \"Two-Handed Bart\" one at a time and pull the cord after each one. You can\\\\\\'t actually make that puzzle unwinnable, so the guards get more and more ridiculous as you summon them over and over. \\\\nMARTIN: I also like trying to go back to the barn after you\\\\\\'ve burned it down. \\\\nRORY: Try having W.D. drink the potion as soon as you make it. \\\\nMARTIN: Oh, that\\\\\\'s a good one. He\\\\\\'ll run through all the puzzles you\\\\\\'ve solved, complaining about each one. \\\\nRORY: Try popping the balloon in the stock market if you want to watch me die. ::sniff:: You\\\\\\'re not that cruel, right? Also, if you wait while the hedgehog plays with the balloon, you can see him try to befriend it.\\\\nMARTIN: Oh, oh! Goofy endings. I think the five-ingredient potion is pretty exciting. \\\\nRORY: SO MANY EXTRAS. \\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, that was exciting to film. Also, if you do have the full Midas potion, you could try pouring it on the other people in the room. \\\\nRORY: I find the \"pour potion on guard\" ending pretty funny for W.D. \\\\nMARTIN: You can also get killed by going to the endgame and just waiting until the treasurer has you executed. That ending kills Frederick but not W.D. Or you can do \"pour potion on wizard\" if you hate us. \\\\nRORY: I guess in some sense that\\\\\\'s the ending we deserve for all the havoc we wreak, but come on man, it\\\\\\'s funny!\\\\nMARTIN: Hm, random things to try. Oh, if you break the alarm cord and then wait around, a workman comes and repairs it. That\\\\\\'s actually a cameo by our Executive Producer. \\\\nRORY: Oh, and W.D.\\\\\\'s girlfriend does not actually appear in the game, if you\\\\\\'re wondering. \\\\nMARTIN: Well, I\\\\\\'ve finished my coffee (thanks again, Rory!) and you\\\\\\'ve finished the game, so I think that\\\\\\'s time to call it a day. \\\\nRORY: Yeah! Thanks again for playing! We hope to see you in another game!\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'Supernova Walkthrough  (Apogee Software)\\\\nBy Ramon Bartschat (bartschat@goldnet.sk)\\\\n\\\\nI will only describe the shortest way. \\\\nAnd I will omit many details. There are many more rooms and objects you should explore on your own.\\\\n\\\\nIn between the described steps you will have to eat, drink and sleep.\\\\n-Sleeping can be done in your hotel room bed or spaceship bed.\\\\n-You can drink your beer and then refill the mug at a water tap at either your room or your spaceships bathroom. You can also drink directly from the water tap.\\\\n-You can only eat the food from the old storehouse; careful it is for a limited amount of times.\\\\n\\\\nSTART\\\\n- Buy a beer, sit at the middle table, wait for the aliens to sit down and then \"listen carefully\" to all they have to say, write down the coordinates they mention.\\\\n(Notice that the holster in your room is of no use in the game, also the rusty key is only needed to open your hotel room, nothing else)\\\\n- Go outside to the old storehouse and get the satchel with food (you don\\\\\\'t need the satchel, just the food)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(SPECIAL CHEAT\\\\n- Go W on the Dusty Road until you \"notice something unusual\" then type ENTER or IN\\\\nThis will take you directly to the ice planet with all the items you need and you will not be hungry, thirsty or sleepy)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWITHOUT CHEAT\\\\n- Go to your spaceship\\\\n- Go to the cockpit, place the cushion on the seat and sit down.\\\\n- To make it past security you have to provide the same \"identity code name\" you defined at beginning the game\\\\n- Fly to the coordinates you overheard from the aliens in the bar (R2/20-8-23 D2/VEGA)\\\\n- Initiate the countdown and rush for your cryo tube\\\\n- Keep trying to land (pushing the button) until you do so.\\\\n- Get out of your spaceship and head for the pyramid. Careful to \"jump stream\" to avoid the acid stream.\\\\n- When you get stung by the animal return to your spaceships laboratory and get serum number 6 (Poisons/Venoms). Put the empty mug in the niche for the serum. The serum dispenser will work only 2 times but you will not need it any more, only this one time.\\\\n- Get the cushion you will need it in the pyramid\\\\n- Return now all the way to the pyramid.\\\\n- Open the mouth of the dog, take the jewel and open the pyramid door with it.\\\\n- Get down to the skeleton room; get the grey disk (you don\\\\\\'t need the skull)\\\\n- Go to the mini-pyramid room; touch the pyramid to open the secret passage. \\\\n- Enter the secret room and get the dusty ball, clean the ball, throw the ball at the wall to extract the shiny key (Should the secret door close then \"turn podium\" to open it again or just leave the room before it closes)\\\\n- Go to the mirror room. In the mirror room go NW-S-SE-E-NE-W-SE and then DOWN. (You might have to try several times until you don\\\\\\'t bump into a wall any more)\\\\n- Drop all you have except the cushion and the shiny key (You will need to carry a heavy rod later)\\\\n- Head for the other mini-pyramid room\\\\n- Put the cushion on the floor, put the shiny key in the keyhole, catch the crystal (wait a little for a secret room to open)\\\\n- Get back to the round room and take the rod\\\\n- CRAWL NORTH, JUMP GAP, PUT ROD IN RECESS\\\\n- Go and take all the items you left before. \\\\n- Go back through the mirror room NW-E-SE-S-NW-SE and UP  (again you might have to try several times to go in a certain direction until you don\\\\\\'t bump into a wall)\\\\n- Go back to where the big climbable tree is. A new way heading SW will be available now.\\\\n- Follow the SW track and enter the Antenna Building  (From now on, when you find things to read, read them backwards - SDRAWKCAB)\\\\n- Go to the transport booth and push the button\\\\n- Go find the robot in the Reactor Control room, \"open panel\" and get the plastic card\\\\n- Open the closed door with the plastic card, enter and get the suit\\\\n- Go to the transport boot and push the purple button to get the goggles, push the cyan button to go to the ice planet. Use the tan button to get back to the planet with your spaceship (to refill water or to sleep for example)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nON THE ICE PLANET (in reality a giant planet size spaceship)\\\\n- Enter the building and put the grey disk in the slot\\\\n- DROP ALL! If not you will loose all when the robot comes. You will find the grey disk here again, you don\\\\\\'t need it.\\\\n- Wait for the robot to zap you and then get all your possessions again.\\\\n- Wear the suit and go out to the circular corridor\\\\n- Go to the Transmission room and turn off the alarm (this is not a necessary step though)\\\\n- Go to the Maintenance room, find and get the gloves (you don\\\\\\'t need the \"device\" found there)\\\\n- Go to the closed door -the one with the picture of a cryogenic tube- and open it with the plastic card\\\\n- Enter to the Emergency Override room and Hit the cryo tube with the mug to free the scientist\\\\n- Either wait for the scientist here or follow him (you will end up in the same room again anyhow; following him gives you a clue where to check which crystal is damaged)\\\\n- Give him the clear crystal\\\\n- Wait to hear all his instructions\\\\n- Head for the elevator and go to the level the scientist mentioned you (480)\\\\n- Now is the time to wear the goggles (to cross the catwalk) and the gloves (to touch the crystals)\\\\n- Exit the elevator and head for the Reactor Regulator room where the panel with the crystals is \\\\n- The robot in Security Tunnel Number 3 will shoot you, you cannot avoid it.\\\\n- Open the panel and get the blue crystal\\\\n- Place your clear crystal in the socket\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThat is about it.\\\\nRemember, there are many more rooms and objects you should investigate.\\\\n\\\\n18.05.2000 by Ramon Bartschat

Before resorting\\\\nto the walkthrough, you may want to get as far in the game as\\\\npossible, using those hints.\\\\n\\\\nThis file is a little discursive, including some actions which are\\\\nnot necessary to complete the game.  However, they should make the\\\\nexperience more enjoyable.  The exact phrases you will need to type\\\\ninto the interpreter are in ALL CAPS.\\\\n\\\\nThis walkthrough is based on Release 2 / Serial number 020130 / Inform\\\\nv6.15 Library 6/2\\\\n\\\\nTHE CABIN\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'re on vacation in Germany, with your wife and daughters.  And (to\\\\nquote the game) \"as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you\\\\nfind that your family is gone...\"\\\\n\\\\nYou begin in the bedroom.  If you examine all the furniture (X BED, LOOK\\\\nUNDER BED, LOOK AT TABLE, etc.), you will find out more about what kind\\\\nof people you and your family are.  But the only thing you really need to\\\\ndo here is OPEN CLOSET, and then SEARCH CLOTHES (GET CLOTHES will also\\\\nwork).\\\\n\\\\n(On the second turn you will hear something passing overhead.  Remember\\\\nthis!)\\\\n\\\\nSW will take you to the living room.  Again, looking at all the things\\\\nmentioned in the room description will add to your knowledge of your family\\\\n(X RUG, X FIREPLACE, X SOFA, LOOK UNDER SOFA).  (If you\\\\\\'ve played Zork, try\\\\ntyping MOVE RUG.)  Play around with things, and make sure to X TABLE.  You\\\\\\'ll\\\\nsee a tiny piece of paper.  X PAPER (READ PAPER would also work).\\\\n\\\\nAha, so that\\\\\\'s where they are.  And you now have a tentative mission: drive\\\\nto town to go shopping.\\\\n\\\\nYou can go NW to the kitchen if you like; X TILES is kind of intriguing, and\\\\nyou could GET GAME and PLAY GAME for a while.  But it doesn\\\\\\'t really get you\\\\nanywhere.\\\\n\\\\n(Hmmm... where do these people go to the bathroom?  I guess it isn\\\\\\'t\\\\nimportant.  :)\\\\n\\\\nFrom the living room, S takes you outside--it\\\\\\'s cold, so you should WEAR\\\\nSWEATER.  You could walk S to the road and try walking S again--okay, you\\\\\\'ll\\\\nneed the car.  Go back N to the driveway.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll be gone for a while; better CLOSE FRONT DOOR.  ENTER CAR, CLOSE CAR\\\\nDOOR, and TURN ON THE CAR.  Ick, the stereo!  (Try LISTEN TO STEREO for a\\\\ngood time... not.)\\\\n\\\\nDRIVE SOUTH (or just S would work) twice and --\\\\n\\\\nUh-oh.  (So *that\\\\\\'s* what passed overhead on the second turn of the game.)\\\\nHere it\\\\\\'s important to notice: the sphere is beta radiant (dangerous to\\\\nexpose yourself to it for long periods of time); it will kill everyone\\\\nin the vicinity (including you and your unwitting family); you have to\\\\ngo get the sphere from the center and bring it back here to the aliens.\\\\n\\\\nYour car is off now, so TURN ON ENGINE, and you can see that a smaller\\\\nroad leads WEST, so follow it.\\\\n\\\\nOUT gets you out of the car (automatically turning off the engine).  \\\\n\\\\nCABLE CAR TERMINAL AREA\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nYou may want to explore a bit: NORTH then DOWN takes you to an iron\\\\ndoor, which you can\\\\\\'t open (at least not yet... but it\\\\\\'s good to know\\\\nthat it\\\\\\'s there).  UP then SOUTH takes you back to the parking lot.\\\\n\\\\n(SOUTHWEST takes you to a garage, but you don\\\\\\'t need to go here.  It\\\\njust gives you another option for the next puzzle.  From the garage,\\\\nEAST goes back to the parking area.)\\\\n\\\\nFrom there NORTHWEST and WEST gets to the actual Cable Car Terminal.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\\\\\'ll see a trunk; OPEN it, GET all the contents (the bag and wrench).\\\\nThen CLOSE TRUNK.  (I don\\\\\\'t know if it\\\\\\'s necessary, but listen:\\\\nsomeone\\\\\\'s hanging around and whistling, and you don\\\\\\'t want them to know\\\\nyou\\\\\\'re here.)\\\\n\\\\nYou want to get across the wire.  There are three ways (at least) to do\\\\nit.  I did it the hard way, so here\\\\\\'s that one:\\\\n\\\\nYour goal is to get the guy who\\\\\\'s whistling to ferry you over.  To do\\\\nthat, you\\\\\\'ll need to hide on the roof of the car.  But once he comes into\\\\nthe room, you\\\\\\'ll have to already be hidden.  So prepare the car:\\\\n\\\\nENTER CAR. UP. OPEN HATCH. DOWN. EXIT.\\\\n\\\\nNow you can lure the guy out:\\\\n\\\\nKNOCK ON DOOR. ENTER CAR. U. U.\\\\n\\\\nWAIT twice and you\\\\\\'ll see the service man come out of his door.  He\\\\nlooks around for you and can\\\\\\'t find you (I wonder why?).  He decides\\\\nto leave anyway.  WAIT three more times and you will be at...\\\\n\\\\nTHE CENTER\\\\n----------\\\\n\\\\nor more specifically at the Upper Cable Car Terminal.\\\\n\\\\nIf you try to get on the floor, there\\\\\\'s no way to avoid being seen.\\\\nInstead STAND ON WIRE and WAIT five times for the man to leave with\\\\nthe car.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t be afraid: type DOWN and you will land safely every time.\\\\n\\\\nPursuing your goal to pick up everything that isn\\\\\\'t nailed down (a\\\\nusual strategy for adventure games), you\\\\\\'ll want to OPEN CHEST, GET\\\\neverything from it (chain and cutters), and CLOSE CHEST.  Again, it\\\\\\'s\\\\nprobably not necessary to close it, but I worry that someone will\\\\ndiscover your theft if you leave it open.  Anyway, that\\\\\\'s everything\\\\nto do in this room, so go NORTH and face the receptionist.\\\\n\\\\nWhen she asks if you speak english, type WOMAN, YES to answer her.\\\\n\\\\nThen she asks for your name.  Fortunately she\\\\\\'s willing to wait a while.\\\\nTo figure out who you are (or who you want to pretend to be), try\\\\nexamining everything in sight.  Specifically, X BOX (or X DESK gives\\\\nyou the same description).  Hey, there\\\\\\'s a tag in there, maybe it\\\\\\'s for\\\\nyou.  X TAG.  Then tell the woman what she wants to hear:  WOMAN, HANS\\\\nLEIBACH.\\\\n\\\\nYou will get that name tag (which you should wear throughout the center),\\\\nand the head of the center, Williams, shows up, and says to come see him.\\\\nBut you don\\\\\\'t want to do that yet; there\\\\\\'s a puzzle in his office you\\\\ncan\\\\\\'t solve yet, until you\\\\\\'ve explored a little.  While you\\\\\\'re here,\\\\nX LIST to tell you everyone\\\\\\'s names, and ASK HENKEL (the receptionist)\\\\nabout all of them.  She gives you especially useful information about John\\\\nand Stefan (namely, that Stefan is gone and you\\\\\\'re replacing him, and that\\\\nJohn drinks).  Try ASK HENKEL ABOUT SPHERE to find out exactly which room\\\\nthe thing is in.\\\\n\\\\nBefore entering the center itself, you may want to begin making a map.\\\\nThis walkthrough will tell you how to get from place to place, but exploring\\\\non your own can be fun too.\\\\n\\\\nGo NORTH into the center.  To get the objects you\\\\\\'ll need for the puzzle\\\\nin Williams\\\\\\' office, go WEST three times (into the kitchen).  You\\\\\\'ll need\\\\npretty much everything here.  GET KETTLE.  Then you\\\\\\'ll have to hunt around\\\\nin the drawers and fridge.  OPEN UPPER DRAWER. GET GLASS.  OPEN LOWER\\\\nDRAWER.  GET KNIFE AND BOTTLE.  OPEN FRIDGE.  GET MEAT.  (X STOVE and\\\\nX WALLPAPER will get amusing messages, though it isn\\\\\\'t really necessary.\\\\nOther messages include X MICROWAVE and USE MICROWAVE (a reference to\\\\nLurking Horror in that one).)\\\\n\\\\n(SOUTH and X CHAIRS gets you another amusing message.  I didn\\\\\\'t find\\\\nanything else to do in the dining room.  NORTH gets you back to the kitchen.)\\\\n\\\\nWhile you\\\\\\'re in the neighborhood, let\\\\\\'s get some more items that will\\\\ncome in handy.  Go EAST twice from the kitchen, then SOUTH into the bathroom.\\\\nGET SOAP.  See that fusevault?  Although it is \"high up on the eastern wall\",\\\\nyou can OPEN it.  Then GET CANDLE AND LIGHTER.  CLOSE FUSEVAULT (you may have\\\\nnoticed by now that I have a \"thing\" about closing doors).\\\\n\\\\nGETTING STEFAN\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a walkthrough, we\\\\\\'re going to do things in a slightly\\\\ndifferent order than if you were just playing straight through.  You\\\\nalready know (because you talked with Henkel) that Stefan is gone, so\\\\nhis office is empty.  There\\\\\\'s a useful item in there.  To get there,\\\\nhead NORTH from the bathroom, EAST three times and then NORTH two more\\\\ntimes.  You\\\\\\'ll be outside his office.\\\\n\\\\nTry going EAST--the door is locked.  X DOOR.  You can see the bolt in\\\\nthe chink...  If there were just some way to lift the bolt.  Well, there\\\\nis.  PUT KNIFE IN CHINK.  OPEN DOOR and GO EAST.\\\\n\\\\nFirst things first: X everything you can see.  X CHAIR doesn\\\\\\'t give you\\\\nmuch that\\\\\\'s interesting.  X COMPUTER won\\\\\\'t help; if you try to login, it\\\\ntells you to talk with Ms. Henkel about it; and if you ASK HENKEL ABOUT\\\\nLOGIN at some point, she tells you she hasn\\\\\\'t had time to set yours up.\\\\nBut it *is* possible to log into the computer, if you know some passwords\\\\nfrom other games.  Meanwhile, X DESK and X BASKET.  Aha, something\\\\\\'s there.\\\\nGET PAPER and READ IT.  You may want to write down the code that\\\\\\'s there.\\\\nIt changes every game, so be sure to keep track of your saved games.  Soon\\\\nwe\\\\\\'ll find out what the code is used for.  \\\\n\\\\nRight now, in fact.  Let\\\\\\'s go check out Schwartz.  If you asked Henkel\\\\nabout him, you didn\\\\\\'t find out much; in fact, he\\\\\\'s the head of security\\\\nfor the center.  To get to his office, go WEST once, SOUTH twice, WEST\\\\nonce, and SOUTH into the office.\\\\n\\\\nFor a security officer, Schwartz is remarkably unparanoid.  Just\\\\nX everything in his office with him sitting there, and he doesn\\\\\\'t even\\\\ncare.  Especially X DESK and X LIST.  Then, you can even GET LIST right\\\\nfrom under his nose.  The list tells you that there are four codes, and\\\\nthat everyone in the center has one.  Except you.  ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT\\\\nCODE.  He just tells you to talk to Henkel, and we already know where\\\\n*that* got us.\\\\n\\\\nASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT SPHERE, although he isn\\\\\\'t very helpful.  But you can\\\\nsee where it is: X VIDEO MONITOR.  Naturally, the one place you want to\\\\nbe is the one place he\\\\\\'s watching every second of the day.  X RECORDER\\\\nand try to play with the buttons--nope, not while he\\\\\\'s here.  At least\\\\nhe prevents you from doing *something* in his office.\\\\n\\\\nGETTING JOHN\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\nWe\\\\\\'ve done enough here.  Finally we can go talk to Dr. Williams.  Go\\\\nNORTH once and EAST twice to his office.\\\\n\\\\nIf you WAIT a turn, he tells you that he wants to propose a toast, but\\\\nhas no glass for you to drink out of.  GIVE GLASS TO WILLIAMS.  (You\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t actually need to wait a turn; if you don\\\\\\'t, you really confuse\\\\nthe heck out of Williams--he probably thinks you\\\\\\'re psychic or something.)  \\\\n\\\\nThen Williams starts looking around in his desk.  WAIT twice, and he\\\\\\'ll\\\\nleave to get your forms.  Now you must spring into action--your goal is\\\\nto get *all* of his whisky.  Fortunately you brought a bunch of\\\\ncontainers with you.  Furthermore, you don\\\\\\'t want him to know that\\\\nyou\\\\\\'ve stolen the whisky, so you have to fool him somehow.\\\\n\\\\nTo be specific, you\\\\\\'ll need to leave the brown bottle full of tea when\\\\nyou walk out of here.  So GET KETTLE.  GET BROWN BOTTLE.  GET GREEN\\\\nBOTTLE. (so you don\\\\\\'t have any awkward moments where the parser tells\\\\nyou \"You\\\\\\'re not holding that\")  POUR WHISKY INTO GREEN BOTTLE.  POUR\\\\nTEA INTO BROWN BOTTLE.  PUT BROWN BOTTLE ON DESK.  Finally, PUT ALL\\\\nIN BAG (so Williams won\\\\\\'t realize what you\\\\\\'ve done).  Then you just\\\\nhave to WAIT (four times) and Williams will return, you\\\\\\'ll sign the\\\\npaper, and then you can GET GLASS and go WEST to leave.  (I\\\\\\'m not sure\\\\nyou need the glass for anything, but it\\\\\\'s just good practice to pick up\\\\nanything you can.)\\\\n\\\\nYou may as well READ DOCUMENT too; it tells you three things.\\\\n\\\\n1) Schwartz is the security guy (but you knew that anyway)\\\\n\\\\n2) The castle area is off-limits (not that you\\\\\\'ll pay any attention\\\\n   to that, will you?) and\\\\n\\\\n3) You need all four codes to get into the security lab.\\\\n\\\\nWell, all that whisky has to come in useful somehow, so let\\\\\\'s go get\\\\nJohn to talk to us.  The people wander around randomly, so you have\\\\nto go find John wherever he is.  I usually wait for him in the library\\\\nor in his office.  Once you and he are in the same room, GIVE GREEN BOTTLE\\\\nTO JOHN.\\\\n\\\\nHe drags you to his office and gets very drunk.  Now is your chance:\\\\nASK JOHN ABOUT CODE.  Again, remember the number--write it down\\\\nsomewhere, since it changes every game.\\\\n\\\\nGETTING WILLIAMS\\\\\\' CODE (with some unrelated activity)\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nSo now what?  Well, since this is a walkthrough, I know that you need\\\\nsomething in the basement.  To get there, leave John\\\\\\'s office by going\\\\nWEST, go NORTH twice, WEST twice, SOUTH twice, and WEST once again.\\\\n\\\\nYou want to go through the door to the south, but you can\\\\\\'t because it\\\\\\'s\\\\nlocked.  Go ahead, X DOOR--notice the \"door closer\"?  X CLOSER.  Try OPEN\\\\nDOOR (no good).  You\\\\\\'ll just have to wait for someone else to go through.\\\\nIn particular wait for a message like \"Petra puts a key in the lock...\\\\nand walks south\" (when I play, it always seems to be Petra), then X DOOR\\\\nagain (notice the description of the bolt... any ideas?).\\\\n\\\\nIf you block the bolt, the door can\\\\\\'t lock.  So PUT SOAP IN BOLT.  Some\\\\nof it is sticking out--that won\\\\\\'t work, Petra will notice.  CUT SOAP.\\\\nNow wait for Petra to leave.  Then go SOUTH and GET PADLOCK.  You can\\\\nX EQUIPMENT, but it isn\\\\\\'t important.\\\\n\\\\nNow we\\\\\\'re going to head outside.  To get there, go NORTH out of the\\\\nstorage room, then EAST, NORTH twice, EAST, and NORTH twice again.\\\\nYou will be in the yard.\\\\n\\\\nKeep going: NORTH, WEST, NORTH into the toolshed.  Only two things to\\\\nlook at here: X BENCH (although it\\\\\\'s rather pointless) and X SCOOTER\\\\n(notice the hook).  You need the scooter, and you need it someplace\\\\nelse.  TURN ON SCOOTER and ENTER IT.  Then go SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH,\\\\nSOUTHEAST, SOUTHEAST and GET OFF SCOOTER and TURN IT OFF.  You\\\\\\'ll\\\\nneed to go inside the poultry house mentioned here by going NORTHWEST\\\\nand EAST.\\\\n\\\\nHere the interesting object is the grating.  X GRATING, then go ahead\\\\nand try OPEN GRATING.  You\\\\\\'ll need some leverage here.  Specifically,\\\\nTIE CHAIN TO GRATING--this wouldn\\\\\\'t have worked without the padlock.\\\\nThen GET CHAIN and PUT CHAIN IN WINDOW (you don\\\\\\'t even have to open\\\\nthe window--it\\\\\\'s broken).  Back to the scooter by going WEST and SOUTHEAST.\\\\n\\\\nThis tripped me up a bunch of times: you have to ATTACH CHAIN TO HOOK.\\\\n(Do not just type \"put chain on hook\", because that doesn\\\\\\'t work,\\\\nalthough it sounded to me as though it did.  Anyway, use the \"attach\"\\\\nsyntax, and you\\\\\\'ll be fine.)  Then PUSH SCOOTER.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s go see what you\\\\\\'ve wrought: NORTHWEST and EAST to get inside\\\\nthe poultry house, then DOWN into the hole and SOUTH.\\\\n\\\\nX DOOR (it should look familiar from way back at the beginning of\\\\nthe game) and X HANDLE.  You can try TURN HANDLE, but it won\\\\\\'t do\\\\nyou any good.  You don\\\\\\'t have what you need, yet.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s our next task.  NORTH, UP, WEST, and NORTHWEST takes you to\\\\nthe center of the yard.  Continue NORTH, EAST, NORTHEAST, and\\\\nNORTH... we\\\\\\'re getting close to the castle that you were warned\\\\nagainst!  READ SIGN to remind you of that very thing.  Well, tough.\\\\nGo on to the NORTH.  (X CASTLE if you want.)\\\\n\\\\nYou have two choices.  To begin with, go NORTHWEST.  There\\\\\\'s a\\\\nuseful item: a ladder.  GET LADDER.  Now go back to the SOUTHEAST\\\\nand try the other passage to the NORTHEAST.\\\\n\\\\nIgnore the western door for now and go NORTH to the bottom of the\\\\nstaircase.  (X STAIRCASE if you like.)  Go on UP to the top of the\\\\nstaircase and follow the exit SOUTHWEST (X HOLES for a little\\\\natmosphere), then WEST.\\\\n\\\\nThis room is a bit complicated.  You\\\\\\'ll want to X everything in\\\\nsight again.  X SHELVES and X CUPBOARD.  Hmm... you can see all the\\\\nshelves except one.  Guess what you need to do?\\\\n\\\\nPUT LADDER AGAINST SHELVES.  CLIMB LADDER.  Hey--X IRON KETTLE\\\\n(you\\\\\\'ll have to keep calling it \"iron kettle\" to distinguish it\\\\nfrom the clay kettle, unless you drop the clay kettle somewhere).\\\\nGET that KETTLE.  Then you can go DOWN off the ladder.\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\\\\\'s time to deal with the cupboard.  Play around a bit before\\\\nyou read the next part--in particular, play around until you die\\\\na few times!\\\\n\\\\nOPEN CUPBOARD.  Hey, X those UNIFORMS.  (Try to GET UNIFORMS for\\\\nan amusing message.)  Well, even though the uniforms are in there,\\\\nthere\\\\\\'s still room for you, so ENTER CUPBOARD.  Now X CUPBOARD\\\\nagain.  The message is a bit different inside here.  Keep on\\\\nexamining stuff.  X WALL tells you about a crack, and X CRACK tells\\\\nyou about a metal plate.  X DOOR also tells you a little about the\\\\nplate.  You can open the rear wall, but I wouldn\\\\\\'t do that yet.\\\\n(Okay, you can try it, but save your game first.)  So how could you\\\\ndo that safely?  All that stuff about the plates means that only\\\\none door can be open at a time: either the door you came through,\\\\nor the rear wall.  So first you must CLOSE DOOR, then you can\\\\nOPEN REAR WALL.  Go on out to the NORTH.\\\\n\\\\nUh-oh, a bomb!  First things first: X BOMB.  Looks like the bomb\\\\nwon\\\\\\'t go off on its own, so you have time to go ahead and X CORD,\\\\nX WIRE, and X STRAP too.  Fortunately, way back near the\\\\nbeginning of the game, you picked up some wire cutters.  So CUT\\\\nRED WIRE WITH CUTTERS, and then CUT CORD WITH CUTTERS.  Yes, the\\\\norder is important.\\\\n\\\\nNow that that\\\\\\'s done, X CUPBOARD once again.  It looks different\\\\nfrom this angle--X PROTRUSION for a little more info, and then\\\\nX BAR for still more detail.  Might as well try to GET BAR.  It\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\'t work, but you can GET BAR again and it *does* work this\\\\ntime.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s all you need on this side of the cupboard, so SOUTH goes\\\\nback inside, OPEN DOOR (since you disabled the bomb, you can do\\\\nthis without fear), SOUTH to get out of the cupboard, and don\\\\\\'t\\\\nforget to GET LADDER before you leave.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that doorway to the west that we ignored?  Let\\\\\\'s go back\\\\nthere.  EAST, NORTHEAST, DOWN, then SOUTH.  Now we can go through\\\\nthat doorway to the WEST.\\\\n\\\\nInteresting.  X HOLE, LOOK IN HOLE, and try going DOWN.  No good.\\\\nFortunately, you brought a helpful item.  PUT LADDER IN HOLE.  Try\\\\ngoing DOWN now--*still* no good.  It\\\\\\'s true you\\\\\\'ll need the kettle\\\\nlater, but you can leave it here for now: DROP IRON KETTLE.  Then try\\\\nDOWN (the third time\\\\\\'s the charm).  \\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s pretty clear the only way to go from here: WEST, and then NORTH.\\\\nYou can X FIREPLACE and X CHIMNEY, and then go on EAST.  Here you could\\\\nX WOOD, X SHAFT, and X BASKET.  Something about this shaft reminds me\\\\nof other games I\\\\\\'ve played--you can bet you\\\\\\'ll be using it before\\\\nyou\\\\\\'re through.  For the moment, GET WOOD and go back WEST.  PUT THE\\\\nWOOD IN THE FIREPLACE.\\\\n\\\\nThe game told you earlier that something was blocking the chimney.\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s go find out what it is.  If you try to ENTER THE FIREPLACE,\\\\nyou\\\\\\'re told that you can\\\\\\'t do it with the metal bar, so DROP BAR\\\\nand then ENTER FIREPLACE.  If you LOOK, you will see bird\\\\ndroppings... Go on UP.\\\\n\\\\nAha, the source of the droppings.  X NEST and X KEY.  Go ahead and\\\\nGET KEY.  That\\\\\\'s all you have to do here, so go DOWN and OUT.\\\\n\\\\nYou may have noticed a mention in passing about the soot, while you\\\\nwere climbing.  X ME to see the effects of the soot.  This wouldn\\\\\\'t\\\\nseem like a problem, but if you go back to the center this way, they\\\\\\'ll\\\\nknow where you\\\\\\'ve been, and remember: the castle is forbidden, so\\\\nyou\\\\\\'ll get in trouble.  You\\\\\\'ve got to remove the soot first.  (For\\\\nan amusing message, save the game and go back the way you are.)\\\\nThere are apparently at least two different ways to clean yourself.\\\\n\\\\nWhat we have to do is melt some snow, and use that to wash off the\\\\nsoot.  What to use for a container?  The iron kettle would be nice...\\\\nWe could melt it over the fire...  But we can\\\\\\'t bring it down the\\\\nladder normally.  There\\\\\\'s another way to get it down, though.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\'s go get the kettle.  Go SOUTH, EAST, and UP to where you\\\\nleft it, and GET IRON KETTLE.  Now to get it downstairs.  Go EAST,\\\\nSOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, and NORTH.\\\\n\\\\nYou haven\\\\\\'t been in here before.  You can X FIREPLACE and X SHAFT.\\\\nI bet you know where the other end of that shaft it.  TURN WHEEL.\\\\n\\\\nOops, you need some snow in the kettle before you get it downstairs.\\\\nGo SOUTH; the snow has been blowing around a lot, or else there\\\\\\'s a\\\\nhole in the ceiling, because there\\\\\\'s some snow here.  So FILL IRON\\\\nKETTLE WITH SNOW.  Then go back NORTH.  PUT IRON KETTLE IN BASKET.\\\\nYou can see you aren\\\\\\'t the first one to think of this.  TURN WHEEL\\\\nto send it back downstairs.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\\\\\'s follow it.  Go SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, WEST, DOWN,\\\\nWEST, NORTH, and finally EAST.  Whew!\\\\n\\\\nTo turn the snow into water, GET IRON KETTLE and take it to the\\\\nWEST.  PUT IRON KETTLE ON WOOD and make a fire: LIGHT WOOD WITH\\\\nLIGHTER.  You\\\\\\'ll have to wait about ten turns until the wood is\\\\nconsumed by the fire and you get the message \"The kettle is not as\\\\nhot anymore\".  Then the water will be bearable.  GET IRON KETTLE\\\\nonce more and WASH ME.  (You don\\\\\\'t have to specify \"with water\" or\\\\nanything like that.)  X ME to verify that the soot is gone.  And\\\\nyou may as well GET BAR--you\\\\\\'ll need it.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re done downstairs, and in fact we\\\\\\'re done with the castle.  Go\\\\nSOUTH, EAST, and UP.  (Notice that you can bring the iron kettle up\\\\nthis way, just not down.  Hmm...)\\\\n\\\\nGo on ahead out of the castle area: EAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, SOUTH,\\\\nWEST, and WEST.\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\\\\\'s time to enter the long building by going SOUTHWEST.\\\\nThere\\\\\\'s only one door you can get to at this point.  Go SOUTH and\\\\nSOUTHWEST into the Hall, and you\\\\\\'ll hear a voice from the WEST.  Go\\\\nthere.\\\\n\\\\nProbably it\\\\\\'s no surprise who you find here--who else would say\\\\n\"Polly wanna cracker\"?  Go ahead and X PARROT, X PACKET, X BRANCH, and\\\\nX WINDOW.  Wait around a few turns if you want, to hear the parrot say\\\\namusing things.  I found references to Zork, Pink Floyd\\\\\\'s The Wall,\\\\nHitchhiker\\\\\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, and some things I didn\\\\\\'t\\\\nunderstand.  When you get bored with that, GET PACKET.  Finally, you\\\\ncan see that this parrot repeats everything it hears, so try to ASK\\\\nPARROT ABOUT CODE.  Yep, it works.  Remember the number.\\\\n\\\\nGETTING PETRA\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\n--------------------\\\\n\\\\nOne more to go.  And it\\\\\\'s also in this building, although you can\\\\\\'t get\\\\nthere from here.  From the parrot\\\\\\'s room, go EAST three times, then NORTH,\\\\nWEST, and SOUTHWEST.  You\\\\\\'ve gone all the way around the building.  X SOFA,\\\\nX DOOR, and finally X WINDOW.  Uh-oh, that doesn\\\\\\'t look promising, but you\\\\nhave to try.  Go ahead and OPEN WINDOW, and go EAST to get inside.  The dog\\\\nmight not like you, but he didn\\\\\\'t stop you from entering.\\\\n\\\\nNow, you have something that might distract him, that you picked up way\\\\nback in the kitchen early on.  X MEAT.  We want to get the dog outside,\\\\nso THROW MEAT THROUGH WINDOW.  The dog is *almost* outside, but he just\\\\nneeds a little help... PUSH DOG and he will be outside.  Quickly, go EAST\\\\nbefore he gets back in--you only have one turn.\\\\n\\\\nIn this room you can X CLOSET and OPEN IT.  X COVERALLS, GET THEM, and\\\\nWEAR THEM.  Now you can face the dog with a little protection.  Go back\\\\nWEST and X DOG.  That necklace looks interesting.  X NECKLACE.  X BOX.\\\\nOPEN BOX and GET NOTE.  READ THE NOTE and remember the number--it\\\\\\'s the\\\\nlast code!\\\\n\\\\nGETTING INTO THE SECURITY LAB\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTime to go input the codes.  We have to get one more item first, though.\\\\nGo WEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, and SOUTH to end up in front of a storage shed.\\\\nYou may as well DROP IRON KETTLE--you won\\\\\\'t need it again, and it\\\\\\'s from\\\\nthe castle, so it would get you in trouble to take it inside.  Then\\\\nUNLOCK SHED DOOR WITH KEY (the key you went to such pains to get in\\\\nthe castle) and OPEN SHED DOOR.  Go NORTHEAST to enter the shed.\\\\n\\\\nX JUNK a few times for some amusing messages (including another\\\\nHitchhiker\\\\\\'s Guide reference).  Then X SACK.  See how it protects\\\\nagainst biological waste?  Wonder if it would do any good against\\\\nradiation... like beta radiation... like the kind that the sphere gives\\\\noff.  Better GET SACK.  Then we can head inside.\\\\n\\\\nGo SOUTH three times, then EAST and SOUTH again.  X SMOKE DETECTOR\\\\n(although it doesn\\\\\\'t tell you much).  Our goal is to lure Schwartz out\\\\nof his office so we can fiddle with his security camera.  Save the game\\\\nhere, because the timing seems to matter in this section.  GET CIGARETTE\\\\nAND LIGHTER, then LIGHT CIGARETTE and DROP IT.  Whoa, you don\\\\\\'t want to be\\\\ncaught hanging around here.  Hightail it SOUTH, SOUTH again, WEST, and\\\\nSOUTH.  Schwartz will run into you on the way, going to turn off the\\\\nalarm, and he\\\\\\'ll also scold you about smoking, but fortunately he doesn\\\\\\'t\\\\ndo anything more serious to you.\\\\n\\\\nNow\\\\\\'s your chance--PRESS REWIND and then PRESS PLAY.  His cameras will\\\\nonly show old footage, rather than showing him you entering the door.\\\\n(If your score doesn\\\\\\'t go up by four points, the timing was wrong and\\\\nyou\\\\\\'ll have to try again.)\\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t think there was any great rush, but there\\\\\\'s no need to dawdle\\\\naround either.  Go NORTH and EAST.  Then go NORTH three times, WEST twice,\\\\nand SOUTH twice.  Finally, go EAST and you\\\\\\'ll see the keypad.\\\\n\\\\nNow you can type in all the codes you got: the one from the dog, the one\\\\nfrom Stefan\\\\\\'s office, the one from the parrot, and the one John told you.\\\\nYou can type them in any order.  Just TYPE XXX ON KEYPAD, with no quote\\\\nmarks.  After all four have been correctly entered, the door will open.\\\\nGo EAST.\\\\n\\\\nWINNING THE GAME\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nThere isn\\\\\\'t a lot of time to waste, and besides you don\\\\\\'t need anything\\\\nelse in the room.  So just GET SPHERE and PUT IT IN SACK (to protect\\\\nyourself from radiation poisoning).  Now you\\\\\\'ve got to get out of here,\\\\nso go WEST twice, NORTH twice, EAST once, and NORTH twice again to get\\\\nto the Yard outside.\\\\n\\\\nSOUTHEAST, EAST, DOWN, and SOUTH brings you to that familiar-looking door.\\\\nOnly, now you can open it.  That bar you have will fit over the handle.\\\\nI tried some weird phrasing here, but OPEN DOOR WITH BAR is all you need.\\\\nGo on out to the SOUTH.  (X SCOOTER and TURN ON SCOOTER for some amusing\\\\nmessages.)  By now you should recognize your surroundings--go UP twice and\\\\nyou\\\\\\'re way back at the parking lot.  It should be pretty simple from here...\\\\nThe aliens wanted you to bring the sphere back to the place where they\\\\nstopped your car.  So ENTER CAR, TURN ON ENGINE and go EAST.\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations, you won!  If you followed this walkthrough, you should\\\\nhave 96 points.

A step-by-step\\\\nwalkthrough is provided at the end, but using it except as a last resort\\\\nwill spoil your fun.\\\\n\\\\nNow, to become regent you\\\\\\'ll need to eliminate five rivals: War Minister\\\\nKlaus Wehrkeit, Christ Minister Pierre Bonfleche, Interior Minister Variola\\\\nModo, Coffers Minister Argento Rico, and Prince Louis. Don\\\\\\'t worry about\\\\nAmbassador to China Marco Pulisci (you can call China and find out he\\\\\\'s\\\\nalready dead).\\\\n\\\\nWEHRKEIT\\\\n\\\\nWehrkeit is fighting the Venetians but soon learns of the king\\\\\\'s death and\\\\nretreats to Piedmont. If you do nothing, he will arrive around 3 o\\\\\\'clock\\\\nand kill you. When you ask Miss Sierra about Venice, she will give you a\\\\npiece of information that the Venetians might be interested in and which\\\\nmay threaten Wehrkeit\\\\\\'s position. You need to contact Venice via the\\\\ntelephone in the throne room. For some money, Miss Sierra will also give\\\\nyou the necessary telephone codes. But you have to ask her in time, because\\\\nat some point Rico will bribe Sierra to give you a false access code which\\\\ntriggers a booby trap.\\\\n\\\\nWehrkeit will still arrive and may still kill you if you run into him and\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t react quickly. But he\\\\\\'s badly injured, and you can either kill him or\\\\njust keep away from him and wait till you get the news of his death.\\\\n\\\\nBONFLECHE\\\\n\\\\nBonfleche is tutoring Prince Charles until he gets the news of the king\\\\\\'s\\\\ndeath. Soon afterward he leaves for Avignon and organizes an invasion of\\\\nPiedmont by Avignese forces. He must be killed while he\\\\\\'s still in the\\\\npalace. If you use the spying equipment in your quarters to monitor\\\\nBonfleche\\\\\\'s quarters, you can witness some extremely unseemly conduct on\\\\nhis part at 2 o\\\\\\'clock. Record it with your master key and show it to Miss\\\\nSierra. She\\\\\\'ll take care of him.\\\\n\\\\nMODO\\\\n\\\\nModo is doing experiments with green slime in an underground lab. To get to\\\\nhim, you need the vials from his quarters. You don\\\\\\'t want to go in there,\\\\nbut with a hostile tone you can order the guard in. Then tell him to get\\\\nthe vials. You also the need the gas mask from the royal quarters. Now go\\\\nto the fountain in the courtyard. Put the yellow liquid and then the pink\\\\nliquid in the funnel. Push the loose tile, use the gas mask, and go\\\\ndown. You\\\\\\'ll find Modo there. Kill him before he kills you. Don\\\\\\'t forget to\\\\npull the cord to prevent the spread of the green haze.\\\\n\\\\nRICO\\\\n\\\\nRico is in his quarters most of the time. If you talk to Princess Charlotte\\\\nin the palace asylum, she will tell you about the unseemly things he\\\\\\'s done\\\\nto her. Unfasten her straitjacket and she will follow you. Go to Rico and\\\\ngive her the dagger from your quarters. (She would dispatch of Louis and\\\\nBonfleche in the same way, but once she has killed one, she will be taken\\\\naway. Since you have other ways to eliminate Louis and Bonfleche, it\\\\\\'s\\\\nadvisable to have her kill Rico.)\\\\n\\\\nLOUIS\\\\n\\\\nLouis sits in the courtyard all the time. There are two balconies above the\\\\ncourtyard. Prince Charles is playing with a heavy toy car in the royal\\\\nquarters. But before you can do the obvious, you have to get the car from\\\\nthe prince. You have to give him something else so that he lets you take\\\\nthe car. Among Rico\\\\\\'s junk is a nice toy robot. Get it while Rico is out of\\\\nhis room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe timing is most critical in this game.

Oddly enough \\\\nthe idea for the Wade War series came to me as a teenager, working \\\\nin a pizza parlor during the mid to late 80\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s.  Today, filed deep \\\\nin my filing cabinet under \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9cCreative Works\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d I have twelve-year-old \\\\nscraps of paper and napkins upon which are scribbled most of the \\\\ntext for the currently non-existent Book One, which takes place \\\\nalmost entirely within the pizza parlor from which it was conceived.\\\\nIf I remember correctly, there once existed a portion of BASIC \\\\nsource code for Wade War I  (WWI) written to run under TRS-DOS \\\\non my TRS-80 model 1.  \\\\n\\\\nIn my twenties, as I began to write games with the intention of \\\\ndistribution, I began to reassess the quality of my games.  Slowly,\\\\nit began to sink in that WWI was not of the caliber that I truly \\\\nwanted to be known for.  The game simply contained too many \\\\ninside jokes.  Events and characters within the game were familiar only \\\\nto a small group of people, most of whom did not even own a computer.  \\\\nVery few would fully be able to appreciate the tale of my war against \\\\nWade.  Something geared for a broader audience, a sequel, began to \\\\nform in my mind.  \\\\n\\\\nHistorically, I have always been one to bite off more than I could \\\\nchew.  True to my nature, I designed the second game to be monstrous \\\\nin size.  It was to be something that had never been seen before.  \\\\nSurprisingly enough, if I were to complete it today, I suspect that this \\\\nwould still be the case.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  Regardless, the story \\\\nnever saw a line of code before the third book in the Wade Wars came \\\\nupon me.  For reasons I do not fully understand, book three came to me \\\\nalmost in its entirety.  Like some strange epiphany it came in a flash.  \\\\nI envisioned in a moment, the entire story.  I saw the references to \\\\nthe previous books, the storyline, the puzzles, the ending and a basis \\\\nfor a fourth book.  It came to me so completely and took a form that \\\\nstood so well by itself that it preempted work upon any previous \\\\neffort.  WadeWar3 was my singular focus for some time.  It existed \\\\nonce, but no longer, on the TRS-80 model 1, as well as the \\\\nCommodore 64.  In 1993, I released the PC/DOS version to SDN, the \\\\nShareware Distribution Network, under the company name \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9cFish \\\\nSoftware\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d.  After a time, my interest waned.   Registration mailboxes \\\\nwere closed, source code was lost, and the game, or so I believed, was \\\\nforgotten.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost a decade later, in the summer of 2000 I stumbled upon it again \\\\non GMD (search engines facilitate things like that).  With a little \\\\nresearch, I discovered Inform, Frotz, and rediscovered Zork again.  The\\\\nold flame for the now dead Infocom games burned within once more.  With \\\\na little effort to learn Inform, a bit of code to extract the text from \\\\nthe original WWIII game and a few weeks in front of my terminal and I \\\\nhad produced a young, new version of the Wade Wars, book 3. \\\\n\\\\nAre books 1 and 2 to come?  Maybe.  WWII has been in development for \\\\nquite some time now, but it is no where near completion as of yet.  Still, for \\\\nthose who are interested in seeing where I\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99m going, there is a work in progress \\\\nthat can be found in the downloads section of OnyxRing.com.  Additionally,\\\\nthere are a few ties to the Wade Wars that can be found in other works that I \\\\nhave done, such as my entry in the Mark Musante\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s Toaster Mini Comp \\\\n(\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9cGot Toast?\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d).  Still, the Wade Wars is around fifteen years old (if counting \\\\nfrom its conception)  There are oh so many other ideas which I may just spend\\\\nthe time to write.  Which brings us to this document.  Although the information \\\\ncontained herein should work fine for the DOS version as well, it is written with \\\\nthe z-code version of the game in mind.  I see no reason why there \\\\nwould be any difference, but just in case there is, this document \\\\ncovers z-code version of the game.  Any questions, suggestions, or just\\\\nplain correspondence should be sent to me at:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tJim@OnyxRing.com.\\\\n\\\\nAnd with that done, on with the walkthrough:\\\\n\\\\nThe point of WadeWar3 is fairly straightforward.  You are the nephew \\\\nof Simon Seamore, a somewhat eccentric scientist and inventor.  Uncle \\\\nSeamore, it seems, has disappeared, as he had before, and you feel \\\\ncompelled to locate him.  You begin in his apartment:\\\\n\\\\n1) Prologue \\\\n(In the Living Room of Uncle Seamore\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s apartment)\\\\n\\\\nW\\\\nRead book\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nPush red button\\\\nS\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\n\\\\nNotes:\\\\nA surprising number of players have written about confusion in the \\\\napartment.  For this reason, I\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ve modified the journal description to try \\\\nand communicate the nature of the huge machine a little more clearly.  \\\\nI hope this helps players.  \\\\n\\\\nOf course if you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re reading this, then you\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99re already looking for answers,\\\\nso I\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99ll just spell it out here:\\\\n\\\\nThis game, indeed the whole Wade War series, deals with alternate \\\\nrealities.  For this story, neighboring realities are \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9ctied together\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d at \\\\ncertain locations.  Machines such as your uncle\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s invention, when used \\\\nfrom these places, push the user (in this case, you) halfway between \\\\nthe two realities for a few moments.  This halfway world spans the two\\\\nuniverses and at the end a three turns, you will be expelled from it and\\\\nplaced in one reality or the other.  If you are fairly close to the machine,\\\\nthe halfway world looks familiar enough (although backwards, as though\\\\nflipped around an axis, marked by your uncle with the yellow line).  There,\\\\nwhen three turns time is up, you will return to your uncle\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x99s apartment.  \\\\nThe further away from the machine you travel, the more differences you \\\\nwill begin to notice (like bark growing on the walls).  There are two locations \\\\nin the backwards world that are far enough from the machine to expel you to \\\\nthe neighboring world after three turns:  The backwards bathroom, or \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9cMoorh \\\\nTab\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d and the backwards closet, or \\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9cTesolc.\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xc2\\\\x80\\\\xc2\\\\x9d  The Moorh Tab route has the \\\\nadvantage of being the direction your uncle took.  Follow this path and you \\\\nwill find your uncle almost immediately.  Of course, not being the first to \\\\ngo this way costs you that element of surprise needed to save your life.  At \\\\nthis point in the game, passage into Askin through the Tesolc is the only way\\\\nto go.\\\\n\\\\n2) Chapter 1\\\\n(At the base of the black tower)\\\\n\\\\nW\\\\nN\\\\nW\\\\nN\\\\nW\\\\nW\\\\nN\\\\nN\\\\nN\\\\nN\\\\nUNLOCK BOX WITH KEY\\\\nOPEN BOX\\\\nGET STONE \\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nS\\\\nE\\\\nE\\\\nN\\\\nN\\\\nPUT STONE IN INDENTATION\\\\n\\\\nNotes\\\\nAt the completion of the above last step, all of your possessions become \\\\nunreachable (you trade places and inventories with the statue).  The game \\\\ncan be completed just fine without most of the obtainable objects in the \\\\ngame up until this point.  There is one notable exception, however.

Could be the gloves.\\\\nH24j: Could you get a more accurate reading?\\\\nH24k: Think of how doctors measure body temperature.\\\\nH24l: Taste the thermometer.\\\\nH24m: Add 273 to the reading and set the temperature dial to that.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ25: Ruby still finds me!\\\\n\\\\nH25a: If she mentions seeing blue, you didn\\\\\\'t set the wavelength dial correctly.\\\\nH25b: If she starts by saying you look hot, you didn\\\\\\'t set the temperature correctly.\\\\nH25c: Notice that Ruby goes to the dead woman.\\\\nH25d: There\\\\\\'s no way out of the biodome, which means you must be inside.\\\\nH25e: And the dead woman is obviously a scientist.\\\\nH25f: Her face is unrecognisable.\\\\nH25g: Ruby might mistake her for you if it wasn\\\\\\'t obvious.\\\\nH25h: Take the woman\\\\\\'s lab coat off her and take it with you into the locker.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ26: I\\\\\\'ve managed to hide from Ruby Eagle. How do I defeat her?\\\\n\\\\nH26a: She won\\\\\\'t be fooled for long.\\\\nH26b: You need to surprise her, so step out of the locker straight away.\\\\nH26c: She\\\\\\'s got you in her sights again.\\\\nH26d: As long as she can see you, there\\\\\\'s nothing you can do.\\\\nH26e: Could you block her vision somehow?\\\\nH26f: With something large?\\\\nH26g: Throw the labcoat at her.\\\\nH26h: You have time for one action only.\\\\nH26i: Her armour protects her body.\\\\nH26j: But if you disarmed Ruby Eagle...\\\\nH26k: Grab the plasma rifle. That\\\\\\'ll take care of her.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ27: Ruby\\\\\\'s dead but I\\\\\\'ve got no evidence.\\\\n\\\\nH27a: You\\\\\\'ve seen the evidence. That\\\\\\'s all that\\\\\\'s required.\\\\nH27b: If you haven\\\\\\'t found the evidence in the casino on level 29, go there.\\\\nH27c: Otherwise head to Utopia Studios on level 27. The gate is open now.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ28: How do I get back past the sentry cannons?\\\\n\\\\nH28a: The crop duster can\\\\\\'t be accessed now.\\\\nH28b: But you have the means to permanently disable the cannons.\\\\nH28c: Use Ruby\\\\\\'s plasma rifle to shoot them.\\\\nH28d: Just don\\\\\\'t go carrying the weapon into the transporter ring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ29: Is there any point to visiting the biodome?\\\\n\\\\nH29a: Physical evidence can\\\\\\'t be retrieved.\\\\nH29b: But you need to discover what\\\\\\'s going on to progress.\\\\nH29c: There\\\\\\'s something the biodome has that\\\\\\'ll be useful later on.\\\\nH29d: An adjustable light setting.\\\\nH29e: Something will show up in the right light.\\\\nH29f: You\\\\\\'ll know what when you\\\\\\'ve found the clue.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEVEL 13 - FREE MARKET\\\\n----------------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: What\\\\\\'s the point of the swapshop?\\\\n\\\\nH1a: For swapping items, obviously.\\\\nH1b: It\\\\\\'s a one for one trade system.\\\\nH1c: You need to find something valuable to trade.\\\\nH1d: Many illegal items are valuable.\\\\nH1e: Such as cyberjacks or the morphtool.\\\\nH1f: And subbuteo pieces.\\\\nH1g: There are other things too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: Which item do I need from the swapshop?\\\\n\\\\nH2a: Is there anything in particular you need?\\\\nH2b: Eventually you\\\\\\'ll need all three items.\\\\nH2c: But one is crucial immediately.\\\\nH2d: Have you listened to the homeless man?\\\\nH2e: Remember the interface port in the guidebot?\\\\nH2f: You need the octagonal headed cyberjack.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: What should I swap for the cyberjack?\\\\n\\\\nH3a: You don\\\\\\'t have many items.\\\\nH3b: The smuggler was bringing in the morphtool...\\\\nH3c: ...so it has value.\\\\nH3d: Unfortunately, you need it to open the robot\\\\\\'s access panel.\\\\nH3e: ...which you can only do in the apartment.\\\\nH3f: Try to leave and the robot closes the panel again.\\\\nH3g: You need both the morphtool and cyberjack...\\\\nH3h: ...so you need to find something valuable.\\\\nH3i: You can find that in the retirement home on level 20.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: What about the homeless man?\\\\n\\\\nH4a: What about him?\\\\nH4b: Have you listened to him?\\\\nH4c: What he says is crucial.\\\\nH4d: In particular the guidebot, Jack and the quotas.\\\\nH4e: Remember the numbers -- 500 credits and 8 hours.\\\\nH4f: You\\\\\\'ll need that information later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: I can\\\\\\'t find Jack.\\\\n\\\\nH5a: If he\\\\\\'s a friend, he should be close by.\\\\nH5b: The man isn\\\\\\'t talking about a person.\\\\nH5c: Remember the interface port inside the droid\\\\\\'s panel?\\\\nH5d: The homeless man is telling you discreetly that you need something.\\\\nH5e: The octagonal headed cyberjack in the swapshop.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ6: What about speaking Jack\\\\\\'s language?\\\\n\\\\nH6a: The man likes his cryptic riddles.\\\\nH6b: He\\\\\\'s referring to something you need to use cyberjacks.\\\\nH6c: You have a cashcard.

The man doesn\\\\\\'t give nothing for free...\\\\nH6h: ...or a measly ten credits.\\\\nH6i: You need more money on your account.\\\\nH6j: You\\\\\\'ll need to work for it.\\\\nH6k: And you can\\\\\\'t reach the industrial levels.\\\\nH6l: But not everybody works in industry.\\\\nH6m: You can find a job on level 17, so go there.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ7: I paid the homeless man, but he gave me nothing in return.\\\\n\\\\nH7a: He\\\\\\'s paranoid, remember?\\\\nH7b: He\\\\\\'ll leave the item for you.\\\\nH7c: In a very safe place.\\\\nH7d: He has ways of getting places normally restricted.\\\\nH7e: Did you hear what the man said?\\\\nH7f: Go home.

Until then, no.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: How do I get the Janie Rourke subbuteo piece out of the exhibit hall?\\\\n\\\\nH2a: Have you tried taking the piece out?\\\\nH2b: The guard doesn\\\\\\'t seem that alert, does he?\\\\nH2c: But he can still hear the alarm, and see you with the piece.\\\\nH2d: He doesn\\\\\\'t have much regard for the alarm system, so you could confuse him.\\\\nH2e: Have you tried putting something on the pedestal?\\\\nH2f: It\\\\\\'ll need to be similar enough to fool the guard.\\\\nH2g: Only one item will work -- something that looks exactly the same.\\\\n     Another subbuteo piece, identical to Janie Rourke.\\\\nH2h: If you\\\\\\'ve far into the game and have found the UTN news article, you\\\\\\'ll know\\\\n     a key fact about two players. But you can make a guess anyway.\\\\nH2i: Janie Rourke has a twin sister named Tania.\\\\nH2j: Don\\\\\\'t carry on until you have the Tania Rourke piece. \\\\n     It\\\\\\'s somewhere in the school on level 21.\\\\nH2k: Put the Tania Rourke piece on the pedestal, hide the Janie piece, and you can leave.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: I\\\\\\'ve got the subbuteo piece out of the hall, but can\\\\\\'t take it out of the museum.\\\\n\\\\nH3a: There\\\\\\'s no way to fool this guard...\\\\nH3b: ...which means you\\\\\\'ll have to deactivate the security.\\\\nH3c: You\\\\\\'ll need to get past the USF troops (see Q1).\\\\nH3d: Examining and having Nanci analyse the museum security will help.\\\\nH3e: You need to remove the radiation from the Janie piece so it won\\\\\\'t be detected.\\\\nH3f: And that means using the deradiator.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: How do I work the deradiator?\\\\n\\\\nH4a: What deradiator? It\\\\\\'ll be obvious when you\\\\\\'ve find it.\\\\nH4b: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve gotten past the USF troops (see Q1).\\\\nH4c: Reading the instruction manual is always useful.\\\\n     Or in this case, the sign.\\\\nH4d: You need to know the donator and the year of donation.\\\\nH4e: Who\\\\\\'s been giving away subbuteo pieces recently?\\\\nH4f: If you\\\\\\'ve found the subbuteo table or message cube, you\\\\\\'ll know the answer.\\\\nH4g: Lucy Song was the donator, so the initials are LS.\\\\nH4h: She\\\\\\'s been giving the items away recently, so you can assume it\\\\\\'s the current year.\\\\nH4i: The year was mentioned on the terminal early on. And the calendar.\\\\nH4j: The current year is 2165.\\\\nH4k: Set the rings to LS2165, put the piece on the deradiator and activate it.\\\\nH4l: Now you should be able to safely remove it from the museum.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: What\\\\\\'s the purpose of the time capsule?\\\\n\\\\nH5a: It\\\\\\'s a ride, so get in.\\\\nH5b: It provides useful historical background...\\\\nH5c: ...and something very interesting in the last room (the archipelago).\\\\nH5d: If you haven\\\\\\'t helped the student in the cafeteria on level 25, you may\\\\n     not realise its significance.\\\\nH5e: The Arcology will do for one of his photos.\\\\nH5f: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t take photos from inside the time capsule.\\\\nH5g: See the hints for Q7 below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ6: How do I get through the emergency exit?\\\\n\\\\nH6a: If you\\\\\\'re on the wrong side you can\\\\\\'t open it.\\\\nH6b: It\\\\\\'s an exit so there must be an entrance.\\\\nH6c: You\\\\\\'ll be able to open it from the other side.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ7: Is there any more I can do with the time capsule?\\\\n\\\\nH7a: There\\\\\\'s not much you can do from inside.\\\\nH7b: You need to get out. Is there a safe area to do that?\\\\nH7c: Try jumping into the water in San Francisco.\\\\nH7d: Ah, the safety harness...\\\\nH7e: You can\\\\\\'t unlock the harness when it\\\\\\'s closed.\\\\nH7f: So you need to prevent it locking in place.\\\\nH7g: Have you examined the harness?\\\\nH7h: If you could block the buckle...\\\\nH7i: Put something small in the buckle before you set off. You\\\\n     can get the item back later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ8: What should I do in San Francisco?\\\\n\\\\nH8a: There\\\\\\'s not much you can do from the air.\\\\nH8b: See the above hints if you want to escape the capsule.\\\\nH8c: There\\\\\\'s something new you can see from the water.\\\\nH8d: A vent in the west wall. You need to reach it, which involves\\\\n     solving a few problems first.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: There\\\\\\'s not much to see in San Francisco.\\\\n\\\\nH9a: There\\\\\\'s Coit Tower...\\\\nH9b: ...and the maglev rail. And the ocean.\\\\nH9c: Most of San Francisco is underwater.\\\\nH9d: Try diving. \\\\nH9e: That valve looks useful. Turn it to lower the water level.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ10: I\\\\\\'ve found the bridge. What now?\\\\n\\\\nH10a: You\\\\\\'re not here for sightseeing.\\\\nH11b: That cable could prove useful.\\\\nH11c: Do you care for Utopia or history?\\\\nH11d: Break the bridge to get a useful item.\\\\nH11e: That won\\\\\\'t help by itself.\\\\nH11f: And don\\\\\\'t stop there.\\\\nH11g: Break it again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ11: How do I reach the vent in the west wall?\\\\n\\\\nH11a: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve lowered the water level.\\\\nH11b: And got two useful items.\\\\nH11c: Have you tried throwing the cable at the vent?\\\\nH11d: If you had something to tie the cable to, it might catch.\\\\nH11e: Like the support pillar.\\\\nH11f: Looks like that\\\\\\'s not the answer.\\\\nH11g: Is there something better to hook on to?\\\\nH11h: Try throwing the cable and pillar at the maglev rail.\\\\nH11i: Now you have a cable to climb.\\\\nH11j: Can\\\\\\'t reach it? How can you get closer?\\\\nH11k: Turn the water valve and try again.\\\\nH11l: You can\\\\\\'t go up... or west.\\\\nH11m: You need to gain some momentum. Is there anything around you\\\\n      could push off?\\\\nH11n: Kick Coit Tower and then go through the vent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ12: I keep on dying in the Colombian trenches!\\\\n\\\\nH12a: Apparently Utopia used real poison gas.\\\\nH12b: Looking before you leap is a good idea.\\\\n      Try examining the soldiers and the trenches from the time capsule.\\\\nH12c: Or if you didn\\\\\\'t, have a good feel around.\\\\nH12d: The soldiers must have survived the gas somehow.\\\\nH12e: You\\\\\\'ll need to be specific when searching.\\\\nH12f: Feel their heads. Or take a gas mask if you know about it.\\\\nH12g: Now you can breathe down here.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ13: How do I clear the smoke?\\\\n\\\\nH13a: That\\\\\\'d be helpful wouldn\\\\\\'t it?\\\\nH13b: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t.\\\\nH13c: You can\\\\\\'t see a thing, so rely on your other senses.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ14: Where do I go in the trenches?\\\\n\\\\nH14a: Did you look at the trenches before jumping in?\\\\nH14b: It\\\\\\'s a bit of a maze, but a very small one.\\\\nH14c: The entrance is in the southeast, the exit in the northeast.\\\\nH14d: Move around and make a mental or written note where the walls are.\\\\nH14e: The maze is a five by five grid with no complications -- going \\\\n      west then east will get you back where you started etc.\\\\nH14f: You can only move in the major compass directions.\\\\nH14g: If you\\\\\\'re still stuck, go W W W N N E N N W W W from the entrance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ15: So what was the point of all that?\\\\n\\\\nH14a: Reaching the Arcology, naturally.\\\\nH14b: And the other side of the fire exit. Now you can come back anytime.\\\\nH14c: Go help the student in the cafeteria on level 25 if you haven\\\\\\'t done so.\\\\nH14d: He needs a photo of the arcology for his portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEVEL 24 - HOLY CITADEL\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: What are the Tenets of Utopia for?\\\\n\\\\nH1a: Reading.\\\\nH1b: Really. They\\\\\\'ll save your life some day (very soon, in fact).\\\\nH1c: You\\\\\\'ll need to learn the lines.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: How do I get into the Citadel?\\\\n\\\\nH2a: Have you read the note on the door?\\\\nH2b: You\\\\\\'ll have plenty of opportunities.\\\\nH2c: Be there on the stroke of the hour.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: I keep getting killed during the ceremony!\\\\n\\\\nH3a: Ruby is eagle eyed and will spot anything out of place.\\\\nH3b: You can\\\\\\'t hide -- at least not while she\\\\\\'s watching.\\\\nH3c: What does the minister say?\\\\nH3d: They\\\\\\'re reciting the tenets.\\\\nH3e: He starts you off so...\\\\nH3f: ...you need to finish them.\\\\nH3g: The Tenets of Utopia are posted outside the Citadel.\\\\nH3h: In response to the first line, say they were unworthy  \\\\nH3i: Then in turn:   They shall all perish\\\\n                     For we are superior\\\\n                     He is our saviour\\\\n                     Long live the director\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: What should I do with the collection plate?\\\\n\\\\nH4a: What would you normally do?\\\\nH4b: Taking the subbuteo piece with Ruby watching is a bad idea.\\\\nH4c: You need to donate something.\\\\nH4d: Any item will do, but getting it back could be problematic.\\\\nH4e: Best put something useless on the plate, like the fried component.\\\\nH4f: Or the cashcard (now useless) \\\\n     or another subbuteo piece (not needed for a while).\\\\nH4g: You\\\\\\'ll get the chance to get the item back (and the Monika Berlin piece) later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: I\\\\\\'m still getting killed in the ceremony!\\\\n\\\\nH5a: What did you do last time?\\\\nH5b: That won\\\\\\'t help since you don\\\\\\'t know the words.\\\\nH5c: Nanci\\\\\\'s comment provides a subtle clue.\\\\nH5d: You need to hide.\\\\nH5e: The citizens are about to bow. There\\\\\\'s your opportunity.\\\\nH5f: Ducking won\\\\\\'t work, since you\\\\\\'ll still be in sight of the citizens.\\\\nH5g: Is there anything you could do while ducked you couldn\\\\\\'t before?\\\\nH5h: Take a look at what\\\\\\'s around? Any hiding places?\\\\nH5i: Hide under one of the pews.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ6: What\\\\\\'s the statue of the Director for?\\\\n\\\\nH6a: For information and looking at what a great man he is.\\\\nH6b: Have you spoken to the student on level 25?\\\\nH6c: Have you helped him with his problem?\\\\nH6d: He needs a picture of the Director.\\\\nH6e: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t get it during the ceremony.\\\\nH6f: Concentrate on surviving then deal with this later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ7: The statue disappeared! How do I get it back?\\\\n\\\\nH7a: The statue only officially comes up during the ceremony.\\\\nH7b: Remember what the minister was doing before the statue raised?\\\\nH7c: Remember what he said? Focusing on the statue and Bible might help.\\\\nH7d: Cometh the year, cometh the day, cometh the moment.\\\\nH7e: Have you looked at the bible?\\\\nH7f: You need to turn it to three specific places.\\\\nH7g: The clues are on the door outside. If you need to get of the hall,\\\\n     check the appropriate hint below.\\\\nH7h: The Director was born on the extra day at a quarter to four in the\\\\n     afternoon in the year 1916.\\\\nH7i: Start with the year, so turn the bible to 19:16\\\\nH7j: What\\\\\\'s the extra day? It comes every four years.\\\\nH7k: You\\\\\\'ll need to enter it in American format, putting the month first.\\\\nH7l: In a leap year, the extra day is February 29th, so turn the bible \\\\n     to 2:29.\\\\nH7m: Then the moment. Use military time format.\\\\nH7n: The time is 15:45.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ8: What should I do with the minister?\\\\n\\\\nH8a: Nothing unless you want to.\\\\nH8b: He may be worth following.\\\\nH8c: You\\\\\\'ll need to hide in the room or leave before he goes to bed.\\\\nH8d: Hiding may give you an extra clue.\\\\nH8e: If you\\\\\\'re not carrying anything, you can get on the chandelier.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: How do I get the items on the collection plate?\\\\n\\\\nH9a: Have you tried taking them?\\\\nH9b: You\\\\\\'ll need to deactivate the forcefield.\\\\nH9c: The stained glass window is the answer.\\\\nH9d: Do those women remind you of anybody? You\\\\\\'ve met at least one by now\\\\n     and heard of another.\\\\nH9e: The animals and colours are important.\\\\nH9f: There are six women, so you need to press six animals.\\\\nH9g: If you\\\\\\'re quick and hide, you can see the last animal the minister pushes.\\\\nH9h: This puzzle is easier to solve later when you know the executives better.\\\\nH9i: Some you won\\\\\\'t have met the first time you\\\\\\'re in the citadel, and you\\\\\\'ll \\\\n     get more opportunities to meet them later.\\\\nH9j: The women have distinctive features, so try to remember which one is which.\\\\nH9k: The first woman was the executive in the tetrahedron -- Ruby Eagle.\\\\nH9l: So start by pushing the red eagle.\\\\nH9m: From left to right, the women are Ruby Eagle, Jet Scorpion, Crystal Mole,\\\\n     Ivory Worm, Amber Bear and Pearl Crocodile.\\\\nH9n: The symbols you need to push are: red eagle, black scorpion, clear mole,\\\\n        white worm, orange bear and grey crocodile.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ10: How do I get out of the citadel?\\\\n\\\\nH10a: You used the same solution to another problem.\\\\nH10b: If the citizens and minister return, they\\\\\\'ll see you.\\\\nH10c: Hide under a pew again.\\\\nH10d: You can come in and out as often as you need to, and\\\\n      don\\\\\\'t have to repeat the ceremony.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ11: I keep getting discovered by the minister!\\\\n\\\\nH11a: Don\\\\\\'t let him see you.\\\\nH11b: See the hints to Q10 if you haven\\\\\\'t already.\\\\nH11c: If he notices something out of place, he\\\\\\'ll raise the alarm.\\\\nH11d: The Director\\\\\\'s statue is very large.

Have you seen something like it before?\\\\nH2f: It requires a cyberjack, but the one you have is no good.\\\\nH2g: Hanging around the student long enough might help.\\\\nH2h: He has the cyberjack, but it won\\\\\\'t work for him.\\\\nH2i: Ask the student for the circular headed cyberjack.\\\\nH2j: Well -- what are you waiting for? Jack in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: What should I do about the dragon?\\\\n\\\\nH3a: Have you tried defending yourself?\\\\nH3b: Looks like that\\\\\\'s not an option...\\\\nH3c: You can\\\\\\'t do anything about it the first time...\\\\nH3d: ...but you need to get rid of the problem.\\\\nH3e: Notice what the student says when you exit.\\\\nH3f: He\\\\\\'s interested in what happened.\\\\nH3g: So tell him about the dragon.\\\\nH3h: Next time you log on, you\\\\\\'ll be better equipped.\\\\nH3i: Try looking at your inventory in cyberspace.\\\\nH3j: It\\\\\\'s a throwing star, so throw it. Bye bye dragon.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: How do I unscramble the text?\\\\n\\\\nH4a: Have you tried reading the text?\\\\nH4b: Have you tried turning the spinners? Both of them?\\\\nH4c: They need to be set to specific letters.\\\\nH4d: Whenever you turn the white spinner, the text changes,\\\\n     replacing the yellow spinner letters in the text.\\\\nH4e: This is a standard substitution cipher, with each letter of the\\\\n     alphabet being replaced by another. If a letter occurs more than\\\\n     once, the substitution is the same each time.\\\\nH4f: Identifying likely words in the coded message helps.\\\\nH4g: Try talking to the student if you\\\\\\'re stuck. Ask him some questions.\\\\nH4h: Does he mention a name? A signature?\\\\nH4i: Ivory Worm. That\\\\\\'s at the end, so try changing the letters.\\\\n     With those in, a couple of more words can be guessed.\\\\nH4j: It\\\\\\'s common to try putting THE or YOU in the text for unknown\\\\n     three letter words, so try that.\\\\nH4k: Remember where you are, and who Ivory Worm is.\\\\nH4l: The text is: \\\\n     YOU CAN\\\\\\'T HIDE FROM THE EXECUTIVE OF CYBERSPACE -- IVORY WORM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: I\\\\\\'ve unscrambled the data. What now?\\\\n\\\\nH5a: The student seems pleased, but he\\\\\\'s got another problem.\\\\nH5b: He asked you a question.\\\\nH5c: Offer to help by saying yes. He\\\\\\'ll give you a task and\\\\n     something to help.\\\\nH5d: This is the only way of getting class two citizenship.\\\\nH5e: You\\\\\\'ll need a camera. You\\\\\\'ve probably seen one already.\\\\nH5f: There\\\\\\'s a camera in Pete\\\\\\'s Swapshop on Level 13.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ6: Where do I find the photos?\\\\n\\\\nH6a: First you\\\\\\'ll need something to take the pictures with.\\\\nH6b: Got that? Good.\\\\nH6c: You can find a map, but not the real Director...\\\\nH6d: ...and you\\\\\\'re already inside the arcology.\\\\nH6e: All the pictures can be found in the Education Levels.\\\\nH6f: Try exploring a little.\\\\nH6g: The Director\\\\\\'s Statue is in the Citadel on Level 24.\\\\nH6h: The Arcology model will do -- that\\\\\\'s on Level 23 in the museum.\\\\nH6i: See the hints for the appropriate level for these photos.\\\\nH6j: You can find a map on Level 25. Not the holomap, a different one.\\\\nH6k: You\\\\\\'ll need to make contact in the Waterline Club first, so follow\\\\n     the hints from there. Read Q8 below if you\\\\\\'re still stuck after that.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ7: Does the student have anything else of value?\\\\n\\\\nH7a: Have you seen what he\\\\\\'s wearing?\\\\nH7b: Have you noticed a series of similar items around?\\\\nH7c: Try asking the student about the Freedom.\\\\nH7d: He has a subbuteo piece of Anya Kaparov.\\\\nH7e: He\\\\\\'ll only give it to you after you\\\\\\'ve helped.\\\\nH7f: Fix the computer, get the photos and then ask him for the piece.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ8: Is there anywhere else to go on campus?\\\\n\\\\nH8a: There\\\\\\'s the cafeteria for a start.\\\\nH8b: Besides that? It\\\\\\'s too easy to get lost without a map.\\\\nH8c: Fortunately you have one.\\\\nH8d: If you have a particular department in mind, you can find it.\\\\nH8e: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve found Professor Zacharias\\\\\\' book.\\\\nH8f: Seems like a useful man to find.\\\\nH8g: He\\\\\\'s in the economics department, so look that up.\\\\nH8h: Head off to the south.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: How do I get past the retinal scanner?\\\\n\\\\nH9a: Have you tried looking in the scanner?\\\\nH9b: It was worth a shot. Presumably you have the book by Professor Z.\\\\nH9c: The key is opening the book.\\\\nH9d: Try reading the hints for the library on level 22 to do that.\\\\nH9e: The next step should be obvious.\\\\nH9f: Wear the lenses and look in the scanner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ10: What can I do in Professor Zacharias\\\\\\' office?\\\\n\\\\nH10a: Not much to start with.\\\\nH10b: Try listening to the professor.\\\\nH10c: He won\\\\\\'t let you touch anything in his office, so your options are limited.\\\\nH10d: But you can look around. See anything useful?\\\\nH10e: Look at the map more closely.\\\\nH10f: It shows the economy and Utopia corporations. Need that for anything?\\\\nH10g: Take a picture. It\\\\\\'ll do for the student\\\\\\'s portfolio.\\\\nH10h: You can\\\\\\'t do anything more until you have class two citizen status.\\\\nH10i: And still not much more until you\\\\\\'ve completed Zacharias\\\\\\' tasks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ11: I\\\\\\'ve got class two citizen status. What now?\\\\n\\\\nH11a: What did the professor say?\\\\nH11b: It might be worth a second visit.\\\\nH11c: In fact, it\\\\\\'s essential.\\\\nH11d: The professor gives you a new task.\\\\nH11e: Notice he gave you a work permit. \\\\n      Try visiting the other levels Zacharias mentioned.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ12: When do I come back to see Zacharias?\\\\n\\\\nH12a: Have you tried re-entering his office?\\\\nH12b: After visiting him as a class two citizen?\\\\nH12c: Seems he doesn\\\\\\'t want to be disturbed.\\\\nH12d: Come back after you\\\\\\'ve finished the set tasks.\\\\nH12e: In fact, there\\\\\\'ll be another reason for coming back later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ13: How do I avoid being captured by the executives?\\\\n\\\\nH13a: You can\\\\\\'t. Go to Zacharias\\\\\\' office after completing all his\\\\n      tasks and you\\\\\\'ll be arrested.\\\\nH13b: Once you\\\\\\'re captured, time becomes critical.\\\\nH13c: You may want to complete other miscellaneous tasks first.\\\\nH13d: But you\\\\\\'ll need to get captured eventually.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ14: Professor Zacharias is no longer in his office. What can I find?\\\\n\\\\nH14a: The first time he\\\\\\'s not there some rather nasty women are.\\\\nH14b: After that, you can take a look around.\\\\nH14c: Remember what Zacharias said before he died?\\\\nH14d: About breaking legs?\\\\nH14e: See any legs to break?\\\\nH14f: Break the two table legs - you\\\\\\'ll find some useful items.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ15: What\\\\\\'s the pentagon headed cyberjack for?\\\\n\\\\nH15a: For putting in a pentagon shaped hole, obviously.\\\\nH15b: It must be somewhere where Zacharias has access.\\\\nH15c: Remember the features of the other interface ports?\\\\nH15d: They were all copper rimmed. See any copper around?\\\\nH15e: Try looking at the map.\\\\nH15f: What to look for should be obvious, since you have the jack.\\\\nH15g: Look for a pentagon on the map -- there\\\\\\'s your access port.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ16: I\\\\\\'m in cyberspace. What are these pyramids for?\\\\n\\\\nH16a: Have you looked at them all?\\\\nH16b: There are five in total.\\\\nH16c: One of them has extra information.\\\\nH16d: A number and a message.\\\\nH16e: There are four digits in the number, and five pyramids.\\\\nH16f: The purpose is more clear when you\\\\\\'ve been to level 32.\\\\nH16g: This is where Zacharias stored important information.\\\\nH16h: The pyramids are crucial to obtaining the security codes \\\\n      for Zacharias\\\\\\' safety deposit box at the bank.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ17: What does the message on the copper pyramid mean?\\\\n\\\\nH17a: It says start with a number. That\\\\\\'s the first security code.\\\\nH17b: The next part says go clockwise.\\\\nH17c: The order the pyramids come in is important.\\\\nH17d: And connecting to the order of the codes.\\\\nH17e: Starting there and going clockwise, the pyramids are copper,\\\\n      glass, sandstone, red and silver.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ18: Some of these pyramids look familiar.\\\\n\\\\nH18a: You\\\\\\'ve seen at least two already: silver and glass.\\\\nH18b: Out in the real world.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ19: There\\\\\\'s only one number in cyberspace. Where are the other\\\\n     four codes?\\\\n\\\\nH19a: Zacharias wouldn\\\\\\'t store them all in one place.\\\\nH19b: You\\\\\\'ll need to look for the pyramids elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ20: Where\\\\\\'s the glass pyramid (second) security code?\\\\n\\\\nH20a: Look at the pyramid closely.\\\\nH20b: A woman on a motorcycle. Remember that?\\\\nH20c: The pyramid is the roof of the game zone.\\\\nH20d: There\\\\\\'s only one room to search.\\\\nH20e: Any numbers on the videogame?\\\\nH20f: The code is hidden in the high score table.\\\\nH20g: The high score for Mother Nature is the second security code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ21: Where\\\\\\'s the sandstone pyramid (third) security code?\\\\n\\\\nH21a: Look at the pyramid closely.\\\\nH21b: It\\\\\\'s a real place.\\\\nH21c: The base is a hint.\\\\nH21d: Seen anything that glows yellow?\\\\nH21e: Jack out of cyberspace and you\\\\\\'ll be right next to it.\\\\nH21f: The code is hidden on the map in Zacharias\\\\\\' office.\\\\nH21g: See the hints at the end for more advice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ22: Where\\\\\\'s the red pyramid (fourth) security code?\\\\n\\\\nH22a: The pyramid looks unearthly doesn\\\\\\'t it?\\\\nH22b: It\\\\\\'s not on Earth.\\\\nH22c: Actually this one is on Mars...\\\\nH22d: ...in cyberspace.\\\\nH22e: Zacharias had an important item on him when he died.\\\\nH22f: Go to the morgue on level 31, get the ticket and follow\\\\n      the trail from there.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ23: Where\\\\\\'s the silver pyramid (fifth) security code?\\\\n\\\\nH23a: You\\\\\\'ve already seen a silver pyramid...\\\\nH23b: ...but the code is usually invisible.\\\\nH23c: You need to retrieve the pyramid given to you by\\\\n      Old Bruce if you don\\\\\\'t have it.\\\\nH23d: Notice the shaft of purple light.\\\\nH23e: That\\\\\\'s telling you the pyramid needs to be in purple light.\\\\nH23f: There\\\\\\'s only one place where the light is purple.\\\\nH23g: You may need to change the wavelength.\\\\nH23h: Go to the biodome on level 12, change the wavelength to \\\\n      violet (380-449) and look at the pyramid again.\\\\nH23i: The number is the fifth security code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ24: Does the map in the office have a hidden purpose?\\\\n\\\\nH24a: There are two important things about the map.\\\\nH24b: You\\\\\\'ll need to be alone in the office to discover them.\\\\nH24c: Find the items in the office if you haven\\\\\\'t already.\\\\nH24d: Look at the hints for Q15 first.\\\\nH24e: See the hints below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ25: How do I read the map?\\\\n\\\\nH25a: Read the hints for Q16 if you haven\\\\\\'t done so.\\\\nH25b: There\\\\\\'s more to the map than an access port.\\\\nH25c: Notice how the map glows. You can make it brighter.\\\\nH25d: You can\\\\\\'t control the map brightness but...\\\\nH25e: Turn off the desk lamp. That should brighten things up.\\\\nH25f: Notice anything about the map colour?\\\\nH25g: Try wearing the lenses then looking again.\\\\nH25h: There are grid references on the map.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ26: What do I look for on the map?\\\\n\\\\nH26a: You can look up specific places.\\\\nH26b: If you haven\\\\\\'t visited the pentagon, don\\\\\\'t read any further.\\\\nH26c: Remember the stone pyramid? It\\\\\\'s a real place.\\\\nH26d: Find Giza -- the map reference is the third security code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=======================\\\\n---RECREATION LEVELS---\\\\n=======================\\\\n\\\\nGENERAL QUESTIONS\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: How do I reach the recreation levels?\\\\n\\\\nH1a: You need to gain access to the residential and education levels first.\\\\nH1b: After that, concentrate on getting class two citizen status.\\\\nH1c: The university on level 25 is a good place to start.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEVEL 26 - TRAVEL AGENT\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: The conductor won\\\\\\'t let me do anything!\\\\n\\\\nH1a: You can\\\\\\'t bargain with the robot.\\\\nH1b: Or destroy it.\\\\nH1c: Or outsmart it.\\\\nH1d: So you need a ticket.\\\\nH1e: You\\\\\\'ll find one in plain sight later on...\\\\nH1f: ...when you have access to the administration levels.\\\\nH1g: It\\\\\\'s in the morgue on level 31.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: I got a ticket. Now what?\\\\n\\\\nH2a: Hand it to the conductor.\\\\nH2b: The rest should be obvious.\\\\nH2c: Take a seat and enjoy the trip.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: What is there to see on the red planet?\\\\n\\\\nH3a: There are some nice canyons.\\\\nH3b: And a red pyramid.\\\\nH3c: Seen anything like it before?\\\\nH3d: You may want to check out Zacharias\\\\\\' office throughly.\\\\nH3e: Zacharias\\\\\\' fourth security code is hidden here.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: Where is the security code hidden?\\\\n\\\\nH4a: Have you examined everything in sight?\\\\nH4b: The pyramid?\\\\nH4c: The canyons?\\\\nH4d: The latter seems to have a pattern. Maybe if you had a better view.\\\\nH4e: Climb the pyramid and try looking at the canyons again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: I can\\\\\\'t see the canyons because off the sun.\\\\n\\\\nH5a: You need to shield your eyes.\\\\nH5b: Astronauts deal with this situation a lot.\\\\nH5c: There\\\\\\'s a visor on your spacesuit.\\\\nH5d: And a control to lower it.\\\\nH5e: But your head is inflexible inside the helmet.\\\\nH5f: So you can\\\\\\'t see the back and side.\\\\nH5g: You\\\\\\'ve had to find things you couldn\\\\\\'t see before.\\\\nH5h: Feel the spacesuit then turn the knob.\\\\nH5i: Now look at the canyons from atop the pyramid.\\\\nH5j: The number you see is the fourth security code.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEVEL 27 - UTOPIA STUDIOS \\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: The studio gates are locked.\\\\n\\\\nH1a: Have you looked at the gates?\\\\nH1b: Tried forcing your way through?\\\\nH1c: There\\\\\\'s no way inside the studios. Yet.\\\\nH1d: You\\\\\\'ll need to come back later.\\\\nH1e: If you haven\\\\\\'t done so, go see Professor Zacharias to \\\\n     get additional instructions.\\\\nH1f: Visit the other two areas he mentioned.\\\\nH1g: The biodome is on level 12, and the casino on level 29.\\\\nH1h: Complete your missions there.\\\\nH1i: Then the studio gates will be open.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: I\\\\\\'m going to be a movie star!\\\\n\\\\nH2a: Good for you.\\\\nH2b: But it\\\\\\'s only a B-vid.\\\\nH2c: And you\\\\\\'re not here to enjoy yourself.\\\\nH2d: Like Nanci said, you\\\\\\'ll only get one shot.\\\\nH2e: And you only have ten minutes to get ready.\\\\nH2f: So ditch what you\\\\\\'re carrying and put on the costume.\\\\nH2g: Don\\\\\\'t forget the holopistol.\\\\nH2h: You\\\\\\'ll get your items back later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ3: What am I supposed to do with the script?\\\\n\\\\nH3a: What do you think?\\\\nH3b: Examine it. Read it.\\\\nH3c: You need more specific information.\\\\nH3d: Remember what the producer said?\\\\nH3e: You\\\\\\'re playing Chinese Soldier #143.\\\\nH3f: So try finding that part in the script.\\\\nH3g: It would be unprofessional to take the script with you.\\\\nH3h: You\\\\\\'ll need to memorise the part.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ4: I keep getting kicked off the movie set.\\\\n\\\\nH4a: You do know what you\\\\\\'re doing?\\\\nH4b: Read the script if you didn\\\\\\'t.\\\\nH4c: And more than a cursory glance is required.\\\\nH4d: See the hints for Q3 if you haven\\\\\\'t.\\\\nH4e: The rest is all about acting.\\\\nH4f: Everything Chinese Soldier #143 does is important.\\\\nH4g: You must perform the actions correctly, and in sequence.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ5: What are my lines?\\\\n\\\\nH5a: You have read the script?\\\\nH5b: Your specific part? See the hints for Q3 and Q4.\\\\nH5c: Your character doesn\\\\\\'t say much. Only three words.\\\\nH5d: But there\\\\\\'s a lot of action.\\\\nH5e: The first instruction is to shoot the zombies, so do that.\\\\nH5f: The weapon has already jammed, so the next step is...\\\\nH5g: Throw the gun at a zombie.\\\\nH5h: Next you have to say something.\\\\nH5i: Say I\\\\\\'m out.\\\\nH5j: Got the hang of it now? The rest is all action.\\\\nH5k: Climb onto a zombie, jump up and grab the gun.\\\\nH5l: Still struggling?\\\\nH5m: Shoot the zombie. Break the crawling zombie\\\\\\'s neck.\\\\nH5n: All you have to do is scream. Then fall into the hole.\\\\nH5o: Whew!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ6: I\\\\\\'ve done my bit. Now what?\\\\n\\\\nH6a: They\\\\\\'re still shooting the movie.\\\\nH6b: But you\\\\\\'re not on camera any more.\\\\nH6c: You need to find a way backstage.\\\\nH6d: Dressing up as a zombie may confuse the crew.\\\\nH6e: And there\\\\\\'s one in the hole beside you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ7: Why\\\\\\'s Nanci acting strange?\\\\n\\\\nH7a: It does seem rather odd.\\\\nH7b: You have more important things to worry about now.\\\\nH7c: You\\\\\\'ll find out why soon enough.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ8: How do I get a zombie uniform?\\\\n\\\\nH8a: Have you tried taking the one from the robot.\\\\nH8b: Colombian uniforms are a different colour to the Chinese.\\\\nH8c: So the one you\\\\\\'re wearing is no good.\\\\nH8d: Unless you disguise it somehow.\\\\nH8e: Look at the Colombian uniform. Read the description.\\\\nH8f: It\\\\\\'s covered in mud.\\\\nH8g: So take your uniform off, drop it in the mud, and put it back on.\\\\nH9h: Now your body looks like a zombie.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: How do I get the zombie\\\\\\'s mask?\\\\n\\\\nH9a: That would be useful.\\\\nH9b: Have you tried taking the mask?\\\\nH9c: It might be easier to get if the zombie lost its head.\\\\nH9d: Fortunately you have the means to do that.\\\\nH9e: What happened on the movie set?\\\\nH9f: Try shooting the zombie\\\\\\'s head.\\\\nH9g: Not working? Remember how holopistol\\\\\\'s work.\\\\nH9h: The robots are light sensitive.\\\\nH9i: And this one\\\\\\'s covered in mud.\\\\nH9j: Try cleaning its head first, then shoot it.\\\\nH9k: Now you can get the mask.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ10: I\\\\\\'m wearing the uniform and mask, but keep getting caught.\\\\n\\\\nH10a: Did you disguise the uniform? See the hints for Q8.\\\\nH10b: Read the text carefully.\\\\nH10c: Holding the pistol gives you away.\\\\nH10d: So drop the gun. It\\\\\\'s useless.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ11: I made it backstage to the prop room. Now what?\\\\n\\\\nH11a: Did you hear what Nanci said?\\\\nH11b: That box looks important. Examine it.\\\\nH11c: You need a hexagonal headed cyberjack.\\\\nH11d: Luckily there\\\\\\'s one around.\\\\nH11e: Search the storage shelves.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ12: This looks like a trap to me.\\\\n\\\\nH12a: Well spotted.\\\\nH12b: But sometimes you need to spring a trap.\\\\nH12c: So jack into the black box.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ13: I\\\\\\'m in cyberspace. This place looks familiar.\\\\n\\\\nH13a: It should. You\\\\\\'ve been there before.\\\\nH13b: Appears everything was a deception.\\\\nH13c: Ivory Worm has you in a trap. You need to escape.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ14: How do I escape from cyberspace?\\\\n\\\\nH14a: Have you tried jacking out?\\\\nH14b: It won\\\\\\'t be that easy.\\\\nH14c: Listen to what Ivory says before the scenario restarts.\\\\nH14d: You need to find a bug in cyberspace.\\\\nH14e: Is there anything that could take place out of sequence?\\\\nH14f: Doing what you\\\\\\'re supposed to won\\\\\\'t help.\\\\nH14g: You need to change the order things happen.\\\\nH14h: Not much happens you can interact with.\\\\nH14i: The only actions involve the Nanci pill.\\\\nH14j: You\\\\\\'re supposed to take it then eat it.\\\\nH14k: But who says you have to follow orders?\\\\nH14l: If you tried to eat the pill before taking it...\\\\nH14m: Remember you want things to be out of sequence.\\\\nH14n: So insist on doing it that way around.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ15: I escaped Ivory Worm\\\\\\'s trap. What now?\\\\n\\\\nH15a: Aren\\\\\\'t you angry?\\\\nH15b: Just a little.\\\\nH15c: You don\\\\\\'t want to lose the element of surprise.\\\\nH15d: Attack Ivory Worm before she can react.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ16: Where\\\\\\'s Nanci gone?\\\\n\\\\nH16a: Did you pay attention to what just happened?\\\\nH16b: Ivory Worm didn\\\\\\'t lie.\\\\nH16c: Nanci\\\\\\'s gone for good. You\\\\\\'re on your own.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ17: How do I get out of the prop room?\\\\n\\\\nH17a: Have you tried leaving through the door?\\\\nH17b: You need a different strategy.\\\\nH17c: There\\\\\\'s no way to avoid being found.\\\\nH17d: If the crew man sees Ivory\\\\\\'s body, it won\\\\\\'t be good.\\\\nH17e: You need to hide her.\\\\nH17f: How did you conceal yourself?\\\\nH17g: Dress Ivory up as a zombie. Put the uniform and mask on her.\\\\nH17h: But she still looks suspicious lying on the floor.\\\\nH17i: Move her body to where the other robots are.\\\\nH17j: Drag Ivory Worm onto the shelf.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ18: How do I get back into the film studio?\\\\n\\\\nH18a: You were lucky to escape before.\\\\nH18b: And you got all your stuff back.\\\\nH18c: There\\\\\\'s no need for a second visit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ19: I\\\\\\'ve done everything here. Where do I go next?\\\\n\\\\nH19a: Ivory Worm\\\\\\'s revelations were startling.\\\\nH19b: You\\\\\\'re not the only one in danger.\\\\nH19c: Better check on Professor Zacharias.\\\\nH19d: Be warned. Timing is about to get critical.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEVEL 28 - GAME ZONE\\\\n--------------------\\\\n\\\\nQ1: I can\\\\\\'t go anywhere on level 28.\\\\n\\\\nH1a: Utopia likes its rules and procedures.\\\\nH1b: You need a permit to play games.\\\\nH1c: You\\\\\\'ll get one when you need it.\\\\nH1d: Ironically you\\\\\\'ll need to play and win games to get it.\\\\nH1e: A casino attendant on level 29 has a permit.\\\\nH1f: She\\\\\\'ll give it to you after you beat the casino games.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ2: I\\\\\\'m inside the game zone.

There\\\\\\'s a subtle hint.\\\\nH8e: Drive into the guards and run them over for some more points.\\\\nH8f: Notice those motorbikes? Blow them up!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: I\\\\\\'ve wrecked the showroom.

See the hints for Q11 first.\\\\nH12b: A shootout with the goons is a bad idea.\\\\nH12c: You could run them over.\\\\nH12d: That\\\\\\'s not the best solution however.\\\\nH12e: Do what you do best. Blow something up.\\\\nH12f: Read the text about the guards carefully.\\\\nH12g: They\\\\\\'re carrying something explosive.\\\\nH12h: Shoot the grenades.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ13: I\\\\\\'ve got a sedan on my tail!\\\\n\\\\nH13a: Don\\\\\\'t worry.

What now?\\\\n\\\\nH15a: Are you going to let it stop you?\\\\nH15b: Shoot something obviously.\\\\nH15c: Killing the snipers will get you some points.\\\\nH15d: But there\\\\\\'s a better way to deal with them.\\\\nH15e: Notice what they\\\\\\'re standing under.\\\\nH15f: Shoot the holoboard.\\\\nH15g: You could go around the truck...\\\\nH15h: ...but you\\\\\\'re a superspy and do stunts.\\\\nH15i: Slide underneath the truck for extra points.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ16: That helicopter is back!\\\\n\\\\nH16a: This is the big boss.

It\\\\\\'s not fair.\\\\n\\\\nH8a: The quiz questions are the same each time.\\\\nH8b: But four are chosen at random from a set of eight.\\\\nH8c: With practice you can get all four right.\\\\nH8d: But the best you can manage is a draw.\\\\nH8e: Unless you cheat somehow.\\\\nH8f: Look at the machine closely.\\\\nH8g: Not everything is on the front.\\\\nH8h: Pull the machine away from the wall. Now look again. \\\\n     See anything familiar?\\\\nH8i: You can hack into the machine and mess with it.\\\\nH8j: But put it back before asking Meagan to play.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQ9: I hacked into the trivia machine.

It is inadvisable to be reading this if you\\\\\\\\nhaven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t looked at the general in-game hints (type \"HINT\" during the\\\\\\\\ngame), and even then this document should be used sparingly. The game is\\\\\\\\nhard, but try to solve as much of it by yourself as you can, yeah?\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll feel better about yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis solution is explained by sections.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE MANDRILL -- Keeping him out of your hair\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerally whenever the mandrill enters your corner of the cage or you\\\\\\\\nenter his, you have one turn to act before he does you in. Early on you\\\\\\\\ncan avoid death by simply moving to a differenct corner of the cage\\\\\\\\nwhenever he approaches. After no sooner than 50 turns into the game the\\\\\\\\nmandrill will become more aggressive, chasing you almost every turn.\\\\\\\\nTemporary methods of fending him off, such as throwing dirt at him or\\\\\\\\nhiding under the bed, may give you a quick breather, but you need a\\\\\\\\nlong-term solution. There are two...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE HORNETS -- Dangerous when aggravated\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe hornets will mind their own business just as long as you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go\\\\\\\\ncasting a stone at their nest, at which point they will fly all about,\\\\\\\\nattacking both monkeys and you. From this time on both the chimpanzee\\\\\\\\nand mandrill will do nothing but run around wildly. This is good in the\\\\\\\\nsense that the mandrill no longer poses a threat to you, but bad in the\\\\\\\\nsense that the chimpanzee can no longer help you. Therefore you must\\\\\\\\nwait until you no longer need the chimpanzee before taking this course\\\\\\\\nof action, because there is no way to recall the hornets. (If the game\\\\\\\\nbecomes unwinnable when you throw the rock at the nest then you still\\\\\\\\nneeded the chimpanzee to do something)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do you survive the hornets yourself? Hiding under the bed is only a\\\\\\\\ntemporary solution. To protect yourself for good you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to cover\\\\\\\\nyourself with a sheet or a blanket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE FIRE -- Ins and outs of taming flame\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNeither the mandrill nor chimpanzee will enter any corner of the cage\\\\\\\\nwhere fire or smoke is if they can help it. In order to build a fire you\\\\\\\\nwill need flint, steel, and tinder. The stone serves as flint. The\\\\\\\\nbarbecue fork, the bucket, or the fan serves as steel. The sheet,\\\\\\\\nblanket, or jersey can be used as tinder. Obviously, to keep the fire\\\\\\\\ngoing you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to keep feeding it with flammable objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you choose to build the fire in the southwest corner of the cage, you\\\\\\\\nhave the advantage of being able to use the fan to blow smoke (when the\\\\\\\\nfire is large enough to produce sufficient smoke) to one of the other\\\\\\\\nthree corners. By rotating the fan you can steer the mandrill out of any\\\\\\\\ncorner of your choosing. In addition, the fire will last longer when the\\\\\\\\nfan is on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe risk you take when you build the fire in the southwest corner is\\\\\\\\nthat it might catch to your bed. If this happens you must act quickly.\\\\\\\\nPut out the fire by throwing or kicking dirt onto it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE BUCKET -- Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t kick it yourself, let somebody do it for you\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do you get the bucket off the platform? There is no way to get atop\\\\\\\\nthe platform yourself. Only the chimpanzee can, but he needs an\\\\\\\\nincentive to go there. Hmm, I wonder what that might be. Yes, toss the\\\\\\\\nbanana onto the platform. The chimpanzee will soon jump after it,\\\\\\\\nknocking the bucket off inadvertently. The bucket will land in the\\\\\\\\nsouthwest corner.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBUILDING THE PULLEY -- It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the only way to open the gate\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe solution to Three Monkeys One Cage in a nutshell is to set up a\\\\\\\\npulley system in which the cord is slung over the bar that protrudes\\\\\\\\nfrom the wall, with a bucket attached to the end of the cord. The other\\\\\\\\nend of the cord is already attached to the top of the gate permanently.\\\\\\\\nWhen a weight falls into the bucket, the bucket descends, causing the\\\\\\\\ngate to rise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe cord can be tied to various objects, then thrown over the bar. It is\\\\\\\\nnot enough simply to tie the cord to the bucket, for you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find out\\\\\\\\nthat the cord is short by just a tiny margin when the weight falls and\\\\\\\\nmisses it. You must first tie the cord to a hook, then once the cord is\\\\\\\\ndangling from the bar you must get the bucket hanging from the hook\\\\\\\\nsomehow. A hook can be found underneath your bed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe only way to get the bucket onto the hook once it has been slung over\\\\\\\\nthe bar is to lift it using the barbecue fork.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nACTIVATING THE PULLEY -- Getting the weight to drop\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce your pulley is all set up you are ready to drop the weight in the\\\\\\\\nbucket. If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t guessed already, it is a coconut that must be\\\\\\\\nused for the weight. Have the chimpanzee get one for you. (CHIMP, CLIMB\\\\\\\\nTREE followed by CHIMP, GET COCONUT)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe coconut must roll down the trough, which you cannot reach yourself.\\\\\\\\nYou need the chimpanzee again for this. (CHIMP, PUT COCONUT ON TROUGH)\\\\\\\\nIf the coconut isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t staying on the trough properly, that is because you\\\\\\\\ndid not remove the husk. You can crack it open with the stone or with\\\\\\\\nthe barbecue fork.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust because the coconut is on the trough does not mean that it will\\\\\\\\nroll automatically. The trough must be inclined. You can use the\\\\\\\\nbarbecue fork to raise one end of it. At last, the coconut will fall\\\\\\\\ninto the bucket and the gate will open! (If the coconut isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t landing\\\\\\\\nsquarely in the bucket, read the previous section carefully)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING OUT ALIVE -- How to leap a great distance and live to tell\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve gotten the gate open there is still more puzzle left to be\\\\\\\\nsolved. The distance to the ground below is too great to jump, yet jump\\\\\\\\nyou must. But you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to make some preparations. To begin with, you\\\\\\\\nmust use the cord again in a different way. You need to hold onto it, or\\\\\\\\ntie it around your waist when you leap outside. The dilemma is in the\\\\\\\\nfact that the cord can only be used for one purpose at a time; it can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nbe tied around your waist while it is being used for the pulley. Were\\\\\\\\nyou to remove the bucket from the hook with the barbecue fork, then pull\\\\\\\\naway the cord, the gate would go back down. Thus you must keep the gate\\\\\\\\nopen another way while you remove the cord from the bar. Do this by\\\\\\\\nplacing an object in the opening to hold the gate up. Namely, the\\\\\\\\nbarbecue fork.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDISMANTLING THE PULLEY -- But only once you no longer need it\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe gate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s open and you need that cord again. But the barbecue fork\\\\\\\\nwhich could otherwise be used to remove the bucket from the hook is no\\\\\\\\nlonger available. How do you retrieve the cord? This is perhaps the most\\\\\\\\ndifficult part of the puzzle, and it requires some timing. The fact is\\\\\\\\nthat you DO need the fork for this. Before placing it in the gate you\\\\\\\\nmust use that versatile tool in one more capacity--as a torch. The\\\\\\\\nbarbecue fork can be used to lift burning objects out of the fire, such\\\\\\\\nas the jersey, or the banana peel, or the coconut husk. You can then\\\\\\\\n\"light the fuse\" by touching the torch to the cord. Then, before the\\\\\\\\ncord snaps, extinguish the burning object and wedge that fork in the\\\\\\\\ngate, as explained above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE FINAL STEP -- Before you can fly the cage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the procedure described in the previous two sections, you can\\\\\\\\nalmost survive that drop. One more precaution need be taken in order for\\\\\\\\nyou to fall the remainder of the distance without injury. You must\\\\\\\\ncushion your fall. Throw as many object out the cage as you like, but\\\\\\\\nthe only one that will make any difference is the mattress. Be aware\\\\\\\\nthat you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t pick up the mattress while you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re carrying other things.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE ANVILS -- Death from above\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter precisely 100 turns into the game, panels on the ceiling will open\\\\\\\\nup to release heavy anvils. A falling anvil will most certainly crush\\\\\\\\nyou in five turns unless you take cover by hiding under your bed.\\\\\\\\nWhereupon the anvils will cease, and bombs will begin dropping in their\\\\\\\\nstead. When the bombs start dropping you have only nine turns left to\\\\\\\\ncomplete the game, so act quickly! There is no way to outlive the bombs\\\\\\\\nsave by completing the puzzle and escaping from the cage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\nIs Three Monkeys One Cage a fair puzzle?

What do I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Drink some water.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are various places in the game (including the building) that\\\\\\\\n   make good water sources. You can also carry one drink\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth in the\\\\\\\\n   bottle.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - And the flask also takes a small amount of water.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m running out of light! What can I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could make sure you finish the game before your lantern dies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could buy some batteries in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'all different\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' maze.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could use the appropriate magic words. They will give your lamp\\\\\\\\n   a one-time boost good for several hundred moves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Harnessing electricity is a kind of sorcery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are a couple of words you may have seen that suggest a famous\\\\\\\\n   person often associated with electricity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re found in the Sorcerer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Lair. Type them as separate commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do it until your lamp is out of power.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Drop your lamp first. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do I do about these little dwarves?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you could just get them on your side, you could have one heck\\\\\\\\n   of a party.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re set in their ways. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The first dwarf that attacks you drops an axe. Get it, then throw it\\\\\\\\n   whenever there are dwarves attacking you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throwing the sword works too, as does just waving it about.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Eventually, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll also learn a magic word that you can use to defeat\\\\\\\\n   them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA pirate stole my treasure. How can I get it back?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Actually, you need this to happen, or you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get his\\\\\\\\n   treasure chest.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n - After he steals from you, go find his chest in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'all alike\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' maze.\\\\\\\\n   He won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t steal from you after you get it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat should I do with the dwarf\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s horn?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - A bunch of dwarves attack you when you blow it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The right magic word might get rid of them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s handy for getting back any treasure stolen by the dwarves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s easier if you wear some protection.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - And a magic way to get rid of the dwarves helps too, just be\\\\\\\\n   careful you follow the instructions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Then again, you could call the owl instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nB. Above Ground\\\\\\\\n---------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat am I doing here?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n - As an adventurer of some ambition, you are trying to collect a bunch \\\\\\\\n   of treasures in the small brick building without getting killed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you do, you might get a nice reward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You may be looking for something in which to carry water.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Follow the path that leads away from the house.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n _ I said \"the path\", not \"the road\"!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get into the cave?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n - There are two ways.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The obvious way is to unlock the grate with the keys from the building.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You will also learn a couple of magic words that will let you teleport\\\\\\\\n   in and out from the building.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the wizard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gate?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The gate is hinged on both sides.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - First, you have to undo the hinges with some sort of screwdriver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - A certain treasure would make a good screwdriver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m lying -- there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no way past.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the meaning of the wooden notice?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I would read it as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'To those who come after me: this is the place to\\\\\\\\n   ---- the s--\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not important until much later in the game. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d better not reveal\\\\\\\\n   the answer just yet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC. Hall of Mists and Vicinity\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the snake?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t subdue it yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need the help of another being.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Catch the bird in the cage, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'drop bird\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'free bird\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' in the \\\\\\\\n   Hall of Mt King.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can I keep the bird from being frightened?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Read carefully what the game tells you when you first ask for help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The bird is afraid of something about you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Did you read the instructions offered to you when you entered the game?\\\\\\\\n   It is written: \"Some objects have side-effects; for instance, rods\\\\\\\\n   scare birds.\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s afraid of your black rod. Drop it before trying to catch the bird.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the dragon?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Just attack it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Yes, with your bare hands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t you wish all the monsters were this wimpy?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the Persian rug?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Roll it up first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the gold nugget out of the cave?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could try throwing it to that passage above the dome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But the result is not very convenient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Rather than carrying it up the steps, use a magic-word exit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat does the hollow voice mean?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s saying a magic word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The word will teleport you between the Y2 room and the building.\\\\\\\\n   This is usually the quickest way to get from the cave to the building\\\\\\\\n   and back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get across the fissure?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Wave the rod. (Nothing really suggests this specifically, but it\\\\\\\\n   stands to reason that magic wands are made for waving.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages, all different?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The names of the locations are subtly different.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - By making a grid and noting where each direction leads from\\\\\\\\n   each location, you can build a map. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a hassle, though.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Actually, you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to go into this maze to finish the game with\\\\\\\\n   all the points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mapped it all out myself. From the west end of long hall,\\\\\\\\n   you can go \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'south, up, up, south\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' to get to the vending machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'north, down, down, down\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' should get you back out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages, all alike?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - This is probably the most famous maze in all of computer gaming. You\\\\\\\\n   should feel honored just to be lost in it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.\\\\\\\\n   Then you can make a grid and chart out which directions go from where\\\\\\\\n   to where.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Or you can ask the game to cheat and show you the list of exits from\\\\\\\\n   every location, which makes them very much less alike.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The main thing is to get the pirate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s treasure chest and any treasures\\\\\\\\n   he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stolen from you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - From the west end of the Hall of Mists, you can go south, east, south,\\\\\\\\n   south, south, north, east, east, northwest to get to the chest. Then go\\\\\\\\n   southeast, north, down to get out of the maze.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat does the message in the sandstone chamber mean?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a favourite quote from technical manuals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in Dwarvish. Surely you can read Dwarvish!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Translate it by moving each letter back one in the alphabet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - This method works for translating the dwarves\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' speech, too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the flute from the shadowy figure?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Is the figure trying to attract your attention?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Have you seen it in more than one place?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It seems familiar.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It looks a lot like you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It is you. Go to the mirror canyon for an explanation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There is no flute, of course. I made that up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But you could try \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'reflect\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and see what happens.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Reflecting gets you to the other side of the mirror, though it is\\\\\\\\n   not at all obvious.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nD. Anteroom and Vicinity\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat are the magazines for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - They are traditionally associated with a last lousy point.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n - Leaving them at Witt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s End gives you that point. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Why at Witt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s End? I haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t the faintest idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get out of Witt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s End?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you go west sixty-five times, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get to the anteroom. It \\\\\\\\n   always feels longer on the way back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Wait -- maybe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 165 times.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Actually, just wander around, going any direction except west.\\\\\\\\n   After a few moves, you should get out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the tusk out of the very low room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no way to get it through the slit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The only way out is down into the sewer, although you seem to die\\\\\\\\n   when you go there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Perhaps you should wait till the sewage level drops.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Actually, if you go back up from the shaft and then down again, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\n   be able to get into the sewers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find anything you lost down the shaft (or in the cellar), plus a\\\\\\\\n   spoon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Make sure to find your way out before you drown, and before\\\\\\\\n   the rats get you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I navigate the maze of passages with streams?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I must say, I roll my eyes at the solution to this one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint suggests that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re somehow offending the dwarves,\\\\\\\\n   I guess.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve just left the sewers. Maybe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that nasty smell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'wash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', then wander up until you get out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I turn the spoon into a treasure?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'epns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' seems like it ought to be a magic word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Did you try polishing it?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I guess the spoon is just worthless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the rope in the chapel for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Climb it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can I get out of the giant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s dungeon?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'lift flagstone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', then go south, then climb up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Of course, you probably lost some stuff when you got thrown in, and\\\\\\\\n   the trick is getting it back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do I do in the giant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s living quarters?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could bring the food with you. Then he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll eat it and kick you\\\\\\\\n   back out. But that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get you anywhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - What else might the giant enjoy?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Bring the nest with you. While he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s eating the eggs, you can do what you\\\\\\\\n   like. Of course, the nest is a treasure, so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get it back\\\\\\\\n   somehow. See the troll question for more help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The room description doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually say so, but you can go south, too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the spider?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Kill it with the sword.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But surely you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have the sword yet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to engage the help of a nearby friend.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The owl will eat the spider for you. Summon him with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'hoot\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Your light scares him away. Turn it off first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - To get the documents, just cut the web with your axe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the mask in the thieves den?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The game says you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t. And it tells the truth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the orb from the cellar?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you could only get past the portcullis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Or the slab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Or the drain. Which is it?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s none of these. The actual solution seems obscure, frankly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Get the orb, then drop something else. If it goes down the drain,\\\\\\\\n   get it later in the sewer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you drop anything large, e.g. the sword, the wizard kicks it out\\\\\\\\n   with you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Of course, you may be able to get the orb without going into the\\\\\\\\n   cellar.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - A portcullis is not the same thing as a solid door, and the drain\\\\\\\\n   has its uses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - No, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to work out the rest for yourself. Or go into\\\\\\\\n   the cellar, like everybody else does.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do the images in the orb mean?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re visions of things that will happen as you play the game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - They can be used as a guide in a particular chain of problems.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to work out for yourself how to know whether the\\\\\\\\n   vision you see indicates your next task, or some random future\\\\\\\\n   one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to use the visions, so you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to be told\\\\\\\\n   how to do that.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the crypt for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where the vampire shows up. I hope you found the crucifix and the\\\\\\\\n   holy water.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - To summon the vampire, you need the wizard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are several ways to invoke the wizard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s help. One of them involves\\\\\\\\n   the little bird. Read the description carefully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Sorry, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m lying again. The vampire doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t move into the crypt until\\\\\\\\n   Adventure 770. In this game the crypt is just scenery.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get into the storage room in the tower?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - No way to do that in this version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the dwarves at the top of the stairs?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You could attack them from above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - First you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d need to get on top of the tower from the outside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t. There is no way to get past them. At least not in\\\\\\\\n   this version of the game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is special about the chalice?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you fill the chalice and then drink, some strange things happen.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n - But whatever you do, you end up losing the chalice, which is a treasure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fun to try, but I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think you can help the princess \\\\\\\\n   successfully. Just treat the chalice like any other treasure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nE. Bedquilt and Vicinity\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCan I get around the Bedquilt area more easily?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - In some places, you can type the name of an adjacent room\\\\\\\\n   to get to it. That can help avoid the problem of crawling around and\\\\\\\\n   winding up back where you started from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I keep the vase from shattering?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need to cushion its fall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Before you drop it, drop the pillow from the soft room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get a light source into the room past the emerald?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you could carry a light source into the plover room, that would do\\\\\\\\n   it. But nothing will fit in from the west. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Are there any other ways to get to the plover room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Yes, actually. Pay attention to the bad pun in the plover room hint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \"Why to plover\" means \"Y2, plover\". Typing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'plover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' in the Y2 room\\\\\\\\n   will get you there. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Plover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' will get you back too, but you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get\\\\\\\\n   the emerald out that way. This is not something you could figure out,\\\\\\\\n   but you can stumble across the solution by trying to refer to the \\\\\\\\n   plover-egg-sized emerald as \"plover\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There is actually a way to get a light source into the plover room\\\\\\\\n   from the alcove, as the hint suggests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s something that can be in two places at once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But you need to ignite it first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do I do with the clam?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can pick it up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can open it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - What would be a good tool for clam prying? Think of sea-related things.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'open clam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' while you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re carrying the trident.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - A pearl rolled out. Go down to the cul-de-sac and get it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the quicksand?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Create a bridge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Read the game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s responses carefully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - When you wave the rod here, although nothing obvious happens, you\\\\\\\\n   temporarily solidify the quicksand. You have to wave the rod again\\\\\\\\n   to get back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I cross the reservoir?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - A full-sized yacht would help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Could you magick the \"Ruby Yacht\" (my, what an awful pun!) to grow\\\\\\\\n   in size? Or maybe shrink yourself enough to use the yacht?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - No dice. You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get across it from the south.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Read the game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can get to the north side by going down the whirlpool in the \\\\\\\\n   waterfall cavern. Make sure not to take anything but your lamp.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Hit the gong to summon Darwin, whom you can ride south.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the sword in the stone?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Like the game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint says, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re just not strong enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Someone with bulging muscles could probably pull it out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Eat the mushroom from the dank cave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can I keep from losing objects in the valuation room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t drop them there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nF. The Plant and Beyond\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do I do with the little plant?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It seems to want water.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Bring water in your bottle, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'water plant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Do it once more for good measure. Now you can climb up to the hole.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Maybe you should try watering it a third time?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the rusted door?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It just needs a little oil.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Fill your bottle with oil from the east pit in the Twopit room,\\\\\\\\n   then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'oil door\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the ogre?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint warns against hand-to-hand combat. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throw something.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The axe isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t good enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throw the sword. Its name is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Thrower\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIs there anything to do in the Sorcerer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Lair?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Remember the magic words on the wall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You might have seen or will see something that emits blue light.\\\\\\\\n   Maybe it is at home here?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Try dropping the starstone here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Yes, the effect can be handy in some special circumstances, but you \\\\\\\\n   don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really need to do this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the sheets of slime?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Fight the green slime with something green.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throw the vial from the spherical room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get out of the maze of ice tunnels?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Map the maze. The passages are all either straight, or bend only\\\\\\\\n   a little.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t miss the sculpture.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Look at your map upside down. It spells a five-letter word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Go to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'This way out\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' room and use that word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nG. The Troll and Beyond\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get past the troll?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throw him a treasure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need one you can reclaim.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Throw him the nest.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Remember the words in the Giant room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Type them, one after another. You should get the response \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Done!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' at the\\\\\\\\n   end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The eggs then return to the Giant room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Make sure you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reclaim them until you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve finished with the area\\\\\\\\n   past the bridge. Otherwise the troll will take revenge on you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get back across the wooden bridge?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need help. Something scary.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The bear can help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Free him, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'get bear\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Use the keys to unlock the chain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Feed the bear first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Try to cross the bridge, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'free bear\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIs there anything to do in the volcano room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Not in the original 350-point version of Adventure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Here, yes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Make a bridge. You know the routine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need something to protect you from the fumes. How about a\\\\\\\\n   mithril ring?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can turn the sword into a ring. Use a magic word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the word written on the stone you found the sword in.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat do I do at the minotaur statue?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a hint at a dead end elsewhere in the cave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need to use the proper tool.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The proper tool can be found in the tool room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Not the rags. The proper tool is a magic word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get away from the gooseberry goblins?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Are you familiar with the myth of Cadmus?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I think he sowed something and grew an army of soldiers, although his\\\\\\\\n   soldiers ended up fighting each other.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - He sowed dragon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s teeth, as I recall. You can just throw them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get through the fog?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint suggests a question that is answered differently in\\\\\\\\n   different places.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Do I need to have my lamp on?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is a good question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The answer to the question is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Not here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the pentagram for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Use it to imprison summoned beings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You can imprison the London Dry Djinn in it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Drop the flask here, then open it, then free the Djinn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can I get the starstone after I drop it?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It has strange spatial properties.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sort of in two places at once. One location (the one not where you\\\\\\\\n   drop it) is where it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s real.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - So when you drop it in the building, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not really there. Note that\\\\\\\\n   you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get points when you drop it there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need to drop it somewhere else outside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Remember the wooden notice? The last word was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'starstone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Luckily, the Djinn will take care of the giant for you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can I get back past the basilisk?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Use the old mirror trick.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - That metal plate ought to do fine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But it needs polishing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'rub plate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' while you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re carrying the rags. Then carry the\\\\\\\\n   mirror past the basilisk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get out of the catacombs?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re hard to map, since they change from game to game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It works like this. The first time you go through the catacombs, any\\\\\\\\n   sequence of eighteen moves will get you back to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Y2?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'. That sequence\\\\\\\\n   determines the layout of the catacombs. When you reenter, you have to\\\\\\\\n   move the same way, or you end up kind of going backward. If you like,\\\\\\\\n   you can play around with dropping objects and see what I mean. I usually\\\\\\\\n   just go straight west the first time. Then I reenter, go west eleven or \\\\\\\\n   twelve times, then wander around a little until I get to the portal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - After I leave the area past the portal, I just go straight west until\\\\\\\\n   I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m back at \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Y2?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get the skeleton\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sceptre past the bridge?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need to leave it behind and get it later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Leave it in the safe. You can also enter the safe from the room with \\\\\\\\n   vaulted ceiling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - How do you open the safe? The game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hint suggests a skeleton key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Use the magic word the skeleton gave you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The word changes from game to game.  Make sure you use the right one.\\\\\\\\n   (There are four of them, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to know all four to finish\\\\\\\\n   the game.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I learn all skeleton magic words?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need them yet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But you will.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Try wearing the crown.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hear anything intelligible? Maybe you should try listening.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Just make sure you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t wind up dead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the Djinn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s word for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - It defeats dwarves. Of course, it also sometimes destroys your\\\\\\\\n   weapons and even gets you killed. Make sure you follow the Djinn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\n   advice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH. The End Game\\\\\\\\n---------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe cave is closing! What should I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You should feel happy, since it means you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve found all the treasures and\\\\\\\\n   are preparing to head to the end game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Just wander around until the cave closes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe cave has closed. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going on here?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - You need to get out of the repository.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Breaking the mirror doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one kind of object here you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t seen before.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The rods with red marks (not stars) are actually dynamite.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Blow up the northeast area.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Drop one of the red-mark rods in the northeast area, then go southwest,\\\\\\\\n   then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'blast\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - If you could get one of those lamps lit, you could go through the hole.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no way to light them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Just ride the unicorn. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m surrounded by gray mist. What do I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s it! You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve won!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Not really. You need to magic-word your way out of here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are sixteen magic words in the game. Note that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'plover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is a\\\\\\\\n   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'travel option\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' -- it is not considered a magic word.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Just say them in the right order. The game will respond \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Ok.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' after\\\\\\\\n   each one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Remember the Djinn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s story about Ralph Witt?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Ralph Witt liked the idea of reverse alphabetical order.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Say the words in reverse alphabetical order.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Still no luck? That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because the magic word given to you by the\\\\\\\\n   skeleton changes from game to game, and you need to know all its\\\\\\\\n   possible versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Perhaps you should have worn the crown, which you found in the safe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m back at end of road again. What do I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - First, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice that the locations are connected backward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are other small changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The notice at the view has changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - But it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t say anything useful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - The five-inch slit is now a five-foot slit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Go ahead. Go on in.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI. Super Spoilers\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat are all the magic words?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - I just can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bring myself to reveal them here. I think the hints in\\\\\\\\n   this file tell you all you need to find them, though. Remember, there\\\\\\\\n   are sixteen individual words, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'plover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is not one of them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat are all the treasures?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - There are thirty-two treasures in all:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   bag of pieces of eight (beach)\\\\\\\\n   crown (safe)\\\\\\\\n   nugget (nugget of gold room)\\\\\\\\n   diamonds (west side of fissure)\\\\\\\\n   silver (N/S passage)\\\\\\\\n   jewelry (south side chamber)\\\\\\\\n   coins (west side chamber)\\\\\\\\n   treasure chest (dead end in maze of passages, all alike)\\\\\\\\n   nest of golden eggs (Giant room)\\\\\\\\n   trident (cavern with waterfall)\\\\\\\\n   helmet (Morion room)\\\\\\\\n   vase (Oriental room)\\\\\\\\n   emerald (plover room)\\\\\\\\n   sceptre (east end of Audience Hall)\\\\\\\\n   yacht (southern edge of reservoir)\\\\\\\\n   pyramid (Dark room)\\\\\\\\n   pearl (cul-de-sac)\\\\\\\\n   rug (secret canyon)\\\\\\\\n   spices (chamber of boulders)\\\\\\\\n   beads (balcony above treasure chamber)\\\\\\\\n   chain (barren room)\\\\\\\\n   spyglass (south end of Jonah room)\\\\\\\\n   sculpture (ice tunnels)\\\\\\\\n   bracelet (room with translucent walls)\\\\\\\\n   casket of opals (very small chamber)\\\\\\\\n   orb (cellar)\\\\\\\\n   tusk (bones room)\\\\\\\\n   chalice (recess in the beams)\\\\\\\\n   sapphire (living quarters)\\\\\\\\n   crucifix (thieves den)\\\\\\\\n   starstone (narrow basalt shelf)\\\\\\\\n   ring (created by player)\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow do I get all the points?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n - Points are gained as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    20 for getting into a dark area of the cave for the first time\\\\\\\\n    10 for getting to beach\\\\\\\\n    10 for getting to Sorcerer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Lair\\\\\\\\n    10 for getting to Valley of the Stone Faces\\\\\\\\n     8 for freeing Djinn\\\\\\\\n    15 for getting to Audience Hall\\\\\\\\n     7 for discovering each treasure (224 total -- Note that the tusk is\\\\\\\\n       not considered discovered until you drop it in the building.)\\\\\\\\n     8 for leaving each treasure in the building (256 total)\\\\\\\\n    16 shortly before \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'cave closing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice\\\\\\\\n    16 for getting \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'cave closing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' notice\\\\\\\\n    19 for getting to repository\\\\\\\\n    16 for getting to gray mist\\\\\\\\n    23 for getting to end of road in the end game\\\\\\\\n    16 for winning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   659 total?

Do not use it unless you\\\\\\\\nare truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your\\\\\\\\nlife.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this\\\\\\\\nwill ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even \\\\\\\\ncontains some of the ending.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s walkthrough, with \\\\\\\\nbetter documentation and some improvements made.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese commands will not work in every single game.  There \\\\\\\\nare some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work\\\\\\\\nfor the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 \\\\\\\\npoint, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows\\\\\\\\nversion does not conform to this, although the documentation\\\\\\\\n*may* be helpful.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI highly recommend Rick Adams\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' page:\\\\\\\\nhttp://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/\\\\\\\\nThis contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an\\\\\\\\nFTP site providing source code and compiled versions for \\\\\\\\nDOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.\\\\\\\\nEven with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due \\\\\\\\nto some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to\\\\\\\\ncompensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor those reasons, you cannot feed this through input \\\\\\\\nredirection, although, if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re astute enough, you could \\\\\\\\nprobably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But\\\\\\\\nI doubt anyone would bother.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure\\\\\\\\non the Web at Stanford\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s machine:\\\\\\\\nhttp://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html\\\\\\\\nThat is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the\\\\\\\\noriginal format that was used, such as five letter packing\\\\\\\\nand such that was output from the other machine.  How close\\\\\\\\nthis is to the original version, I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t say.\\\\\\\\nI recommend the Web version if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re running a 14.4 \\\\\\\\nconnection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit\\\\\\\\noutdated anyway.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnjoy playing, and I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m sorry I had to do this to you.  But\\\\\\\\nif it wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t for this walkthrough, I never would have gotten\\\\\\\\non with *my* life.  :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n************************************************************\\\\\\\\nbuilding  /*  This will take you to the building, a well \\\\\\\\n              house for a large spring  */\\\\\\\\ntake lamp  /*  This is vital.

It was written\\\\\\\\nfor version 1.1. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is \\\\\\\\nnot an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores \\\\\\\\nseveral non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions\\\\\\\\nto some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant \\\\\\\\nchunks, so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more-or-less clear why you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing. This \\\\\\\\nmeans that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it \\\\\\\\nshould be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game \\\\\\\\nwithout necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section\\\\\\\\nI say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from \\\\\\\\nbeginning to end will know where to begin from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, \\\\\\\\nbut others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will \\\\\\\\nsay so. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper \\\\\\\\nbuilding) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that \\\\\\\\nperiod, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s desk, \\\\\\\\nwhich is randomly determined each game. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe beginning\\\\\\\\n-------------\\\\\\\\nNE E\\\\\\\\nZ Z NO\\\\\\\\nSIGN PAPER\\\\\\\\nSTAND\\\\\\\\nDROP KNAPSACK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Powerhouse -

Of course you should read the crumpled note, which basically spells out your predicament--your girlfriend Natalie has apparently left, and you are without your work shirts, which you will need to return to work the following Monday (currently it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Wednesday), if only to re-establish some sanity or order in your life.  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t immediately be able to get down the stairs, because Natalie seems to have returned, to look for her \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'mojo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' (her \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'lucky charm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'), and moved some bookcases to block the bottom of the stairway (it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a narrow staircase)--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll learn this from the sticky note she left on one of the bookcases.  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to move them from where you are--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to get down by some other means.  All you will need from the upper level here is your backpack, your notepad (SEARCH PILE--the one by the bed), and your walking stick (the staff--LOOK UNDER BED).  Make sure you always have these things, though there will be a few times where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll  have to put them down.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a small, two-story apartment--the overhead fan is just over the banister from all locations on this upper level--but at different distances from each location.  It is also your ticket downstairs, but first, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to turn it off.  The switch is on the fan itself, but you cannot reach it with your hands--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need the staff to turn it off with.  If you look at the fan from different locations, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see (or not) the switch from different angles.  The switch is on the side opposite from the Loft Bedroom--it is in full view from Stairs--but way too distant.  However, in Bedroom Entrance, it is much closer and you see it in profile--an ideal angle from which to HIT FAN SWITCH WITH STAFF.  Now you want to GET ON FAN, but not from Bedroom Entrance, because you also want something sturdy which will break your fall, when the fan detaches, and possibly reduce chance of injury--how about the train-safe refridgerator??  Go to Loft Bedroom and GET ON FAN (JUMP OVER BANISTER will also work, there).   You will now be able to MOVE BOOKCASES from downstairs--if you want.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can now explore the apartment, if only to find some clue of where to start your mission.  Read the message on the mirror in the bathroom, take the binoculars, in the black case (these will be indispensible) from Natalie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bedroom. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find the key to her closet stuck in her chair cushions if you SIT IN NATALIE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CHAIR or SEARCH NATALIE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CHAIR.  You can look in her closet (SEARCH ART DESK to find the light switch for it), but that won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be useful until you find all the shirts.  When you leave Natalie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room, after getting the binocs--Surprise!--you find your office shoes!  Easy points!  Go to the Kitchen and look out the back window--see the odd flash of red?  LOOK AT ODD FLASH WITH BINOCULARS.  Now you have a sense of purpose.  You can go out the front door now, but be sure you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re clear on which building the Red Shirt is on top of.  The building right in front of your back window, the one with the black trampoline on top, is Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Men\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Store.  The building that has your shirt on top is the one directly across the street from it going due east--from Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s and your back window (on the east wall of the apartment).  You just need to remember that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s across from Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE RED SHIRT\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- WALTER\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGoing north out the front gate from the parking lot, you go east to Center Street, then go south to get to Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s.  You are free to do some exploring, but your destination is really the building across the street from Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the Vacant Building.  You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t climb up the building from the street; you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to go into the building--the main entrance is barred off--but there is another entrance--go south then east into the Gravel Lot--the entrance is north from here.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to find out how to get Walter to let you in.  Ask him some questions--ASK WALTER ABOUT MAGAZINE, ASK WALTER ABOUT HIMSELF, ASK WALTER ABOUT BUILDING, ASK WALTER ABOUT REHAB, ASK WALTER ABOUT LUNCH BOX--you can ask him about other things (even your Red Shirt), but the idea is to gain his trust by showing an interest in him and/or the building.  Then he will make a proposition--get him a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'drink\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and he will let you in.  He will even tell you how to get the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'libation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to get it from Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- BROCKWOOD\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThen you go into Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Store--he will take your backpack--don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need it here, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get it back once you leave.  Go northwest to the Fitting Room.  Look in the mirror there--push the mirror, then voila, you can enter the back room (the locked door in the sales area leads to it, but you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use that door).  There is a desk there, with a waste basket next to it.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get into the large drawer, this is where Brockwood hides his booze.  (By the way, I encourage you to look at everything that seems interesting in this game!)  Look in the waste basket for the key.  Read the ledger that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in the drawer--to feel better about stealing his gin.  For an interesting excursion, try sitting in the swivel chair, and SPIN CHAIR.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get the key to the hatch in the ceiling, to get on the roof--this will remind you of the trampoline that is there, and the location of the Red Shirt.  Though you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really need anything up here.  Now go back down through the Fitting Room and into the store, with the gin bottle--surprisingly, Brockwood will allow you to leave with his bottle--he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really trying to give it up.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- THE BAIT AND SWITCH\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut really, you have no intention of giving a bottle of real gin to an alcoholic.  The game won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t let you!  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to make Walter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'think\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s real gin.  From Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Front, go south then west to Business Parking, then northwest to Brockwood\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Nook--there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a water tap there.  POUR OUT the gin bottle, then TURN ON WATER TAP, and FILL BOTTLE WITH TAP.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry about opening or closing the bottle, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s automatic.  Then go back to Walter in Vestibule (SE, E, E, E, N) and give him the bottle.  He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll assume it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s real because you obviously got it from Brockwood, he won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t ask questions, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll leave, giving you his nametag.  You can now enter the building, but there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one more item you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need--go back out to Gravel Lot, go NE, and pick up the lantern there.  Now turn it on and you have light.  Now go through the Vestibule into the Cluttered Passage, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find the roll of duct tape and a newspaper page--which you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to look at (please take all take-able items, they will all fit in the backpack).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- THE SCIENCE LESSON\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs you go into the Auditorium, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice a hatch way up in the ceiling--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s open!  If you guessed that your Red Shirt is on the roof beyond this hatch, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re correct!  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to figure out how to get up there.  The key is LEVERAGE.  The newspaper page gives some clue--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to put together something that will help you get up there--if only to get your shirt.  Try some things--turn on the spigot, turn it off, turn on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'engine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', turn it off--just to get a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'feel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' of what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re about to do (Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, Walter won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t come back until after you \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'do your thing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' here, no matter how long it takes)--already there is what is called an Archimedean Screw, this is your base power source.  Now, go west into the Dim Front--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find a scaffold, examine it--better yet, look at it through the binoculars.  Now PUSH SCAFFOLDING EAST. The scaffolding has a yardstick on top, with a 5-gallon bucket tied to the end, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s held down up there by a statue--a precarious balance--try to think of what would throw this balance off?  LEVERAGE.  Fill that bucket, and the statue will topple.  What can fill it--because you cannot reach it--??  The engine.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to PUSH SCAFFOLDING TO ENGINE.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSo, how could the statue toppling be useful to you??  You could PUSH SEESAW TO SCAFFOLDING--but there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one more thing.  You might not get enough LEVERAGE to vault you through the hatch (and yes, you are going to be on the seesaw). TURN CRANK CW(or CLOCKWISE)--try both directions to get a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'feel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' for how it works.  What happens?  A bathtub appears, suspended by a chain.  Look at it, better yet with the binocs.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find that if you turn the crank CW, the bathtub gets nearer to the engine--CC(or COUNTERCLOCKWISE) makes it go the other direction.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want the tub to be next to the scaffolding, so TURN CRANK CW until the tub almost buts up against the scaffolding.  Let the messages guide you.  Your final addition will be the seesaw--PUSH SEESAW TO STAGE EDGE--you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want it to be directly under the tub.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, all you have left to do is put some energy through this system.  And you--the Artist--are going to be the vital fifth element.  Get your stuff together--everything in the backpack, close it up, put it on your back, put the staff through the straps.  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the lantern beyond this room, so you can drop it here.  Now turn on the spigot, turn on the engine--you have a generous five moves to get on the seesaw.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow let it sing!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf all went well, you are back in Kitchen--having gone through the hatch--but not before seeing Walter charge back in--snatched your Red Shirt, crossed the street (albeit in the air), bounced off of the trampoline and through your own back window.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve come full-circle!  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry about the police that are now in that Gravel Lot (Walter called them), just avoid it.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get thrown in jail anyway, which will be part of this journey, but I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d rather you do that part last (but if you want to go ahead and do it, go to the Gravel Lot or the police station and get yourself arrested by either having Walter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nametag on you or giving the nametag to the sergeant at the station--then skip ahead to BOB AND ROGER, and come back when done).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can continue exploring, but you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get anywhere without interacting with Jerry, the Barber.  So---\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nJERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wondering why he is groping around, you can either look at the pictures on the walls, or in the hallway to the east of his Shop area--or just ASK JERRY ABOUT GLASSES.  He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll tell you that he tripped on the curb and they fell off and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'bounced off somewhere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.  Go to Corner Curb and look in the grating--that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where the glasses are.  Jerry is a bit self-absorbed, so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to have to figure this one out without his (conscious) help.  Your utility key will not help you open the grating--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to need something sharper or flatter.  You may have noticed the screwdriver in the barber chair..??  Of course, you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t just take the screwdriver in the presence of its possible owner, so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to engage in a little subterfuge.  GET IN BARBER CHAIR--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll automatically put down your backpack and other stuff.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be surprised when Jerry pulls out your White Shirt(!), using it as a bib.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to play along here, because you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to just take the shirt just now, Jerry is a bit stubborn.  Let him cut your hair, but while you are on the chair, TAKE SCREWDRIVER.  When he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s finished, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be out of the chair again and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to give him the $10 bill--declining the $2 change as a courtesy to him (you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need it).  Then go to Corner Curb and PRY GRATING WITH SCREWDRIVER.  Then open it and take the glasses.  Play around with them for a while if you want, but they are useless to you--and the world to Jerry.  Give them to him, and you get--a ticket to Bunco Springs Amusement Park(BSAP), down the street.  But not your shirt...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGo east from the shop, into the bathroom, if you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already.  There is a sheet in the hole in the ceiling--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see it when you LOOK UP.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the source of the draft.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get this sheet down.  Neither the sink nor the toilet are sturdy enough to stand on, so you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to get on the shelf--with the towel bar to hold on to.  Take the magazine off of the shelf, then take the towel--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need something to replace the sheet with--then GET ON SHELF.  Now take the sheet and see what it really is.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a barber bib!  Now put the towel in the hole--you will automatically spread the towel over the hole.  Now you can go back into the shop area and give the towel to Jerry.  Now he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a happy camper!  Plus, seeing his error, he gives you your shirt back!  Now you have your White Shirt.  And you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for the park!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE PARK\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can do more exploring again, if you want.  If you go to the Demolished Building further south past the park, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see a yellow streamer hanging from the flagpole.  Using the binocs, once again, you discover it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your Yellow Shirt!  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get it, yet, because you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t yet have the means to do so, however the sign in front of the building gives you a clue.  Now you should focus on the park, and what you CAN do.  Remember the suggestion about getting your spirits up and perhaps a ride will do the trick...??  Though you are supposed to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'afraid of heights\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', but now you are so depressed that you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t care.  Anyway, go in through the Amusement Park Entrance, and give the ticket to Chester in the ticket trailer.  Feel free to get to know Chester and how much of a jerk he is.  You can do some exploring around the park, and even see the demolished building from another angle, at the end of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'nature path\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'--go into the hole in the tower, go up the stairs--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see the Thinker, and the skylight up top--that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where the flagpole is rooted.  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to open this skylight or remove it, but tuck it away in your memory.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnd be careful not to leave the park until after you get results--and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll know it when you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you tried to get on the roller-coaster, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice no one is there to start the ride, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to start it, so nix the idea for now.  Really, the only other ride is the Wonder Wheel, manned by our friend Rex.  If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re feeling really sneaky, go to his car in the parking lot and LOOK IN REX\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CAR--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get a white paper bag--there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s some stale popcorn in it so he won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mind..?? (In fact, if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t take the bag, and you do the Wonder Wheel, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll leave for lunch in his car, leaving the bag behind.)  Feel free to ask Rex about anyone you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve met so far, even about important things.  Ask him about the duck, in fact ask him about the popcorn.  Ask Rex about himself.  Now have your binoculars in hand--or wear them--so he can see them--then GET INTO WHITE CAR--he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see your binocs and tell you he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll stop the wheel once you get up top--this is crucial, as it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an important vantage point, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get only one chance to do this.  Once he stops the wheel, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice something--what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that clinging to the nearer loop on the roller-coaster??  LOOK AT BLUE SPLOTCH WITH BINOCULARS--that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your Blue Shirt!!  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have 6 moves to do this before the wheel starts up again, and you are back on ground level.  Feel free to use the remaining time to look at other things around you, with the binocs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, you can go to the Kiddie Pond, and give the popcorn to the duck--he gives you a gift.  TAKE ROCK.  Perfect for throwing.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll realize its use when you get on the Crock Blocker!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you are on the platform for the Blocker, you have six cars to choose from.  This is important--if you get on the wrong car, too far forward, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to catch your shirt as it floats by when you are doing the second loop.  In fact, if you get on the yellow car, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doomed, because the bar on it is loose--avoid it (devilish grin)--get on the rear car, #6.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget to DROP your stuff before getting into the car.  Now when you are in the car, throw the rock at the green lever, and let the ride begin!  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to type a command, just let the ride do its thing, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve made the important choices and now just sit and enjoy.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll catch your Blue Shirt near the end of the ride.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to rest yet...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHear the ticking noise..??\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSEARCH CONTROL BOOTH.  Now you have an incendiary device in the shape of a pipe.  Time is important here.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry about the whats and whys now, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to put the pipe where it won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be of any danger to anyone, but perhaps more importantly, where it would be of use to you.  In fact, I encourage you to play around with it, have some fun, try giving it to people, etc etc.  Take advantage of SAVE and RESTORE.  You have 20 moves to get this right.  Think back carefully about where this device might be of use.  Seen any demolished buildings lately??\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnd have you been in the tower?  Third floor?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMore crucially, remember your Yellow Shirt?? It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s on the flagpole at the top of the tower.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get this --shall I say, bomb--up there.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to somehow attach it to the skylight, so it will work properly--just leaving it in the room won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be effective enough.  Got the tape?  PUT TAPE ON PIPE.  Now, PUT PIPE ON SKYLIGHT--it will stick.  Now, high-tail it out of there, fast!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBOOOMMM...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got 15 moves to do this right....and pay attention to what goes on, particularly after the bomb goes off...if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t see these things, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know why you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to do certain things, particularly Chester\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s movements, and the hawk that flies over--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see all this if you are back in the park in time to hear the blast from there. Chester will run out of the trailer to get a look, and at the same time, a hawk will fly over, with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'something yellow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' in its beak.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see the hawk deposit it on top of the trailer, realizing it to not be food.  Chester meanwhile will run to his car to contact--the police?--on his wireless.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get into the trailer and do 2 things--1) get your shirt from out of the skylight, and 2) develop evidence against Chester, because he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s certainly got a leg up on you.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFirst thing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first--you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get into the trailer from the front window.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to go to the back of it, via BSAP Parking(go SE from there, or S from Main Exit).  Look under the trailer for the key.  Unlock the door there and you are in.  Your Yellow Shirt is there in the skylight--take it.  Now look at what Chester has left behind--particularly the notebook.  Read it.  Now take it.  Now get out of there, and wait for the police to show up.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll figure out that Chester has opportunistically framed you for the explosion--you would have been accused whether you set the bomb or not.  His diary is your proof that he set that bomb, intending for it to go off after the first ride on the Blocker.  With his diary in hand, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be exonerated for this felony, and let go, with your Yellow and Blue Shirts.  But if you have the nametag on you--Walter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s--they will arrest you and put you in jail for the destruction of the other building (unless you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve already gotten yourself arrested--if so, and you \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'got results\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', skip ahead to NAP TIME.  Otherwise, read on).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOn the other hand, if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have the diary, the game will end with you being thrown into the Big Clink--not the one at the police station.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE DRUNK TANK\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYep, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'pokey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.  Walter has got his revenge.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nothing you can do here, essentially, except talk--but you have another 20 moves to do it in.  Get a look at your cell mates.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find that only one is really sleeping.  Look at the one in the blue jacket.  He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lying awake.  Look at his jacket.  You may wonder why he is clutching his jacket and shaking.  Is it DTs??  ASK BLUE MAN ABOUT ANXIETY.  He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll loosen up--then you get a surprise!  Your Green Shirt pops out!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get it right away.  It seems to hold some meaning for him.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to verbally give him some proof that you should have the shirt.  TELL BLUE MAN ABOUT RED SHIRT(or any other shirt you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve already gotten--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll automatically tell him about Natalie and missing all of the shirts, etc).  How hard was that?  Now you can use the remaining time to get to know Bob and his friend, ask him some questions, about people and things, in the cell, etc.  When the time is up, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll all be escorted out of the cell and back into town.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see Bob and Roger again, in action, so to speak.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can return to town by going north from here.  If you have all the shirts, read on from here.  If you got only the Green and Red Shirts, go back to JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT.  If you got only the Green, Red and White Shirts, go back to THE PARK.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you have gotten all the shirts, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be prompted to go home and take a nap.  Follow the messages and clues once you get there.  This is where we segue into what is essentially Part II of the game.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNAP TIME\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGo to Natalie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room and GET ON NATALIE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S BED, because you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to feel closer to her--and, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve always wanted to know how comfortable her bed is.  Read all the clues.  When you wake up, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see her diary(!) laying on the bed next to your head.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll disappear only if you try to take it while off of the bed, or if you take it and then leave the bed--and it will reappear when you get back on the bed.  The only thing you need it for is for a password, and how and where to use it.  So READ DIARY.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll only see the words inside the front cover--pay attention--the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' will be one of five possible words, all beginning with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'f\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'--fooble, forsnook, finsteeth, frotzle or frachet--it was chosen at random at the start of the game, so it can be different if you restart at this point--you will not be able to use one of these words, even if you make the right choice, by chance, without first seeing it in the diary--if you try, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get a snarky response (but try it anyway).  And take her advice--remember to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'whisper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE SECRET ALCOVE \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhere is the alcove?  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not her Nook out in the Living Room.  Remember the closet?  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to have the light on and go deeper inside it.  Now, WHISPER (the magic word you found in the diary).  Surprise!  Go into that area.  Now look around, do whatever you want, look at the cards, learn about tarot.  Pick up the card on top of the deck.  Look at the cards in the spread.  You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to do these things, but I encourage you to read and explore.  Really, the important thing here is the mojo.  In fact, while you are here, if you listen long enough, Natalie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s voice will spell out your next mission--find her and bring her mojo to her!!  Take the mojo, then step back out.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE INVITATION\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs soon as you step back into her room, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll hear something like an engine running outside, and knock at the door.  Answer it.  YOU got a package, for a change.  But also, the mail has arrived.  Take the black box, and then go check your mailbox.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to sift through the junk mail 3 times before finding the important thing--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an invite to your boss\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s party--TODAY.  And you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to go in your dress shoes--which you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t got yet (they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on the list!).  But you decide that they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to take you in your office shoes, so put them on.  Wonder what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in the box??  Open it and look into it!  AHH!  Natalie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been KIDNAPPED.  That is, if you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already figured this out.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice some other strange things about this box/sphere.  It seems to tug you in certain directions.  Follow that.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll take you down Lookout Avenue--and while you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going down there, feel free to explore and look at things.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to be late, anyway, so take your time.  Examine Mabel Maybre\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s--your landlady\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s--mansion across the street from you, take a walk down the street, go on the south side.  Look at the end of the street, past your boss\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s house--particularly the property with the small house, fenced in.  Now go to the party...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHE PARTY\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you arrive, finally, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see most of your co-workers leaving--you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need them.  Go up and knock on the door.  If you have your invitation--and the office shoes on--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be grudgingly admitted, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, this is the only possible way to get in.  Now you can spend all the time you want talking--or trying to talk--to John, Rick, Scottie, look around, etc., but at one point Scottie will be prompted to leave, and John goes upstairs for a nap.  You can spend all the time you want doing whatever you want, but what you should do is first go into the dining room where Richard is, and read the note on the counter.  John found some shoes, and had them thrown to the dog.  Were they yours??  In any case, you feel resentful.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIndulge your curiosity.  When John went upstairs, he left the rope detached.  So go on up!  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, his wife cannot stay in one place very long, she won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t catch you or notice you.  Follow the snoring.  Now you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in John\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room.  Stay quiet.  Look in the closet--gotcha!  Look at things.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to take two things--really three--the key from the drawer in the nightstand, and John\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s shoes.  Yep, John\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s shoes.  Be quiet about it!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow go back down and onto the patio.  What do we do with the shoes??  Remember the note on the counter??  Now do unto John as he has done unto whoever those shoes belonged to.  Could be you, maybe not.  But be careful not to throw them directly at Ruffy.  You see, the sphere is pulling towards the doghouse, and you want to go in there without Ruffy knowing.  So you want to distract him a little.  Is there a tree, or a fence, in the other direction??  THROW JOHN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S SHOES AT TREE, or THROW JOHN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S SHOES OVER SHORT FENCE.  He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get right after them.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow the party\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s over for you, you must now go into the doghouse--you can look around there if you want, but you have 5 moves to unlock the gate with the key you found in John\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room--or face Ruffy.  Look at the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'mass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' you find there--take it for the points.  Now go--go south, then take the curious object you find on the ground nearby.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re now at the vacant property next door--if you explored around the Raditch House before you came to the party, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll realize that this is the house that was fenced in.  The sphere tugs you strongly in this direction, then breaks from your grasp and busts against the cellar doors outside the house, as you approach.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nObviously, you should go down in there...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNATALIE...??\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou find Natalie tied into a chair in this cellar.  But not too tightly, as you find out, if you try to cut her bonds--with the strange \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'handle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'--which is a switchblade (aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t they illegal now?).  You can take the bandanna out of her mouth, and then UNTIE NATALIE.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find out that she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not too conversational--time is of the essence.  What was your mission?  To give her the mojo.  So do it!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut you just can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t....\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can try.  In fact, you can try three times.  Or not.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEither way, about 15 or so moves after you free her, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find out that she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMABEL!  Your landlady!  And she becomes a giant bird!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnd that the small house and cellar were just a mirage!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore you have any time to think, Mabel flies up and takes you with her.  Why couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t she just take the mojo??  Because it would reject her grasp.  But there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s something about that she NEEDS, and it needs to be willingly given to her by its owner--which is the REAL Natalie.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLOCKED UP, AGAIN?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou wake up in a jail cell, tied--this time much more tightly--to a chair, bolted to the floor.  In a dark, mildewy jail cell underground.  You cannot do anything, you cannot get up.  But wait, what is that in your back pocket (assuming that you did pick up that strange \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'handle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' back at the vacant property?)??  Push the little button on the handle in the back pocket--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a switchblade!  Cut the ropes with it.  Now you can get up--to find out that the cell door isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t locked.  You can now leave the cell and go west into the main area--but also collect all of your things from the dungeon alcove just beyond the cell.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, all Mabel is interested in is the mojo, which you are still wearing because she cannot take it off of you.  Is this a dungeon, or is it a gym??  Because you see all this exercise equipment laying around.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find out for sure about 15 moves from the time you entered the Exercise Room before Mabel comes down to toture you--and the game ends. Try some of it out, if you want, but what you want to do is open the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'steam bath\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and pick up the alabaster key from the floor inside it.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need it later.  If you want some laughs, SAVE your position, and try some of the other equipment!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow what you have left to do, here, is leave through the hatch overhead.  Now you are at Base of Mountain--pick up the plastic stick that you find there, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a phosphorescent light stick--BREAK STICK for a light source.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to go east over to the oak tree fast--you have 5 moves from the time you emerged from the hatch before Mabel spots you.  Once you get to the tree, you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to worry about Mabel again--for now.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNIGHTSCAPE\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow from Tree Base, the only way you can go is UP.  You can wear the light stick on your wrist, and put everything you have in your backpack, wear it, and then WEAR STAFF (in case you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t yet found out, the staff can be slid through the straps and worn in this way).  Now go UP the tree.  You are immediately presented with three branches going in northerly directions--north, northeast and northwest.  Which one is correct??  You can try them if you want.  But look around.  There is a hollow behind you--look into it!  There, you find a leather whip!  Read the tag--\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'From the One That Got Away\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s another branch--overhead.  SWING WHIP AT STRONG BRANCH.  Then SWING ON WHIP.  Bombs away!!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYour way from here is pretty well cut and dried--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on the other side of the fence, so you can follow the path around the mountain, and then into the cave--which is a tunnel that goes into the heart of the mountian.  Now go into the door--after picking up the piece of paper lying there.  Now you are in a strange place...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBLACK AND WHITE\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is just an abstract piece of interactive fiction that I decided to write into the game...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow you are in the center of a perfectly white room with a huge black dot--there is even a sign indicating where you are!  If that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not enough, the piece of paper you have also has a huge black dot--this is a map, of sorts, showing you where you are.  Again, you can walk around, examine, explore all you want.  Use the white key that you got from the exercise room to unlock the white door, go into the room with the desk and examine the huge book that you find there--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a ponderous tome written by Rene Decartes.  What is perhaps his most famous saying?  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'I think, therefore I am\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.  So we come to the one thing you need to do here.  Think.  But you need to do this in the right place.  Go where you feel most \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'centered\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'--on The Dot.  Now--guess.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTHINK.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nON THE MOUNTAIN\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow you are on the terrace near the top of North Mountain.  Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry about getting off the mountain or back where you were.  And don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry--yet--about Mabel.  Examine the fire--what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in it?  You have about 5-7 moves to take your nametag from the flames.  That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the last thing on your list!  You get the points.  Put the nametag on, because it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an important identity symbol.  Now you can look around and examine things there on the terrace.  Specifically, examine the hole on the side--what do you notice just over the side, near the hole?  A cave entrance, on a lower level.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get down there.  How?  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a precarious climb, and there are no hand-holds.  Seven symbols of your identity will be needed to help you climb down there.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re already wearing one--the nametag--as a sort of bolster to your courage.  Now, what do you have that can fit into the hole?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYour staff.  PUT STAFF IN HOLE.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to have to make a rope--with the remaining five things.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe shirts.  It doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t matter what order you tie them in, you can do it this way--TIE RED SHIRT TO WHITE SHIRT.  TIE BLUE SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE YELLOW SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE GREEN SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  Or however.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow you have a long rope.  Obivously, you can TIE ROPE TO STAFF.  Voila!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemember to be wearing your nametag before you go.  Now, DOWN....\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou are now in front of the cave entrance, on a narrow ledge.  The only way to go is into the entrance, south.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou find--NATALIE!--but she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lying down with her hands tied.  She notices you--listen to her--she IS the real Natalie.  Cut her bonds with the switchblade--you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to untie the leather string.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnother surprise!  (And don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, you did everything correctly up to here.)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow you have TWO Natalies!  Is this a good thing??  No, because one of them is Mabel!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow ask either one of them anything!  Try anything!  Have fun!  You won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to tell which one is which, no matter what you do or ask--but listen to what they say.  The crucial thing is knowing which one to give the mojo to.  After about 20 moves from the time you freed the real Natalie, one of them will say something interesting.  Remember the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' from earlier?  She will say that word, to which the other will say \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Oh bullhockey, honey, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t listen to her!  She\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nuts!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'  Which ever one, the Natalie on the left, or the Natalie on the right, that said the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'magic word\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is the one that you should give the mojo to!  (Like the magic word, which Natalie is the correct one is not necessarily the same in each complete game playing.)  Now watch the pyrotechnics!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGETTING HOME\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNatalie has now flown you both back down to the ground, but beyond that point, she is not exactly going to hold your hand on the way home.  Really there is only one route you can go--she will not let you turn back.  Listen to her as you pass the Goblins, Inc. shop--an important suggestion.  You are now on Center Street--but now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s night time and you are heading south to the corner at Rex\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been here before, but just during the day when it wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t so active.  Now turn west--you are now at the Alley Entrance, again.  You see two pairs of feet sticking out of the alley--EXAMINE FEET, for another surprise!  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your two buddies from the jail cell!  Natalie looks none too patient, but she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to wait for a bit, because this is a very important encounter--a key conversation.  You have 20 moves to tell them about the right things.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThey want to know how your quest is going.  Now TELL BOB ABOUT one of the following--Natalie, Mabel, the kidnapping, the shirts, the rescue.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBob will then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'confer with his cohort\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and in moments, this results in him donating their jackets to you and Natalie.  You get Bob\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s jacket, because, with your bald pate, you look more like him, and Natalie gets Roger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s jacket--and she gets the fedora--with her hanging on your neck, this makes you two look like the two of them, with Bob toting Roger to their lodgings for the night, at the apartments.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow all you have to do is get home.  Literally.  Continue west to Lookout Avenue Apartments, go south into the gate, and go back to the apartment.  Your disguise fools the giant bird hovering around the mountain to the north, until the hat blows off of Natalie--just as you get inside the gate.  Then Mabel spots her and as the two of you start running, the gate begins to close.  Crazy Mabel doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t notice this, as intent as she is, and just as she swoops down, the gate closes!  Game over for her!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnd for you.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThank you for playing my game, and as the ending says, look out for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Bullhockey 2!\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'This is a walkthrough for Cold As Death, by Gorm. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the time of the walkthrough creation, this game could be played at\\\\\\\\nhttp://www.lai.as/games/ColdAsDeath/ .\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince actions are timed, you have 20 seconds between run or jump\\\\\\\\nactions; if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t take one of these actions every 20 seconds, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nfreeze to death.

Daar kun je een briefje \\\\\\\\noppakken. In het briefje staat hoe je de commando\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in kunt \\\\\\\\ntypen. Als je door het raam klimt, zul je de schep vinden. Als \\\\\\\\nje naar je slaapkamer gaat, zul je een kleine, brandende \\\\\\\\nlantaren vinden. Het is ook mogelijk om een tukje in je bed te \\\\\\\\ndoen. Verder is hier nu nog niets te doen, dus ga weer terug \\\\\\\\nnaar de kamer. In het oosten is een hal, waar een sneetje \\\\\\\\nbrood, een fles melk en een munt liggen. Ook staat er een \\\\\\\\nmooie houten kist. Als je de kist beter bekijkt, zul je een \\\\\\\\nvreemde inscriptie ontdekken. Misschien is het handig als je \\\\\\\\ndie inscriptie even opschrijft. Misschien ook niet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNu kun je je huis verlaten en naar buiten gaan. Je staat dan \\\\\\\\nmidden in het dorp, en je ziet de herberg en in de verte een \\\\\\\\ngroot, eng kasteel. Ga de herberg binnen. Ga zitten en luister. \\\\\\\\nJe zult een aantal gasten horen praten. Luister dan nog een \\\\\\\\nkeer en de gasten zullen opstaan en ergens anders gaan zitten. \\\\\\\\nAls je weer bent gaan staan, wil je natuurlijk de knoflook \\\\\\\\nhebben. Maar je mag het niet pakken van de waard! De oplossing \\\\\\\\nis dat je intypt \"koop knoflook\". Dan zal de waard het gewoon \\\\\\\\naan je geven. Typ dan \"vraag waard\" en hij zal je een trap \\\\\\\\nnaar de zolder laten zien. Ga naar de zolder. Daar tref je een \\\\\\\\nkist aan die onder het stof zit. Blaas het stof weg, en er \\\\\\\\nkomt een oud boek te voorschijn. In dit boek staat hoe je \\\\\\\\nvampiers kunt doden. Bekijk de rare steen ook eens goed... Je \\\\\\\\nkunt ook het bloed op de grond onderzoeken, maar daar wordt je \\\\\\\\nniet veel wijzer van. Ga weer naar beneden in de herberg. Als \\\\\\\\nje in een agressieve bui bent, kun je de waard in elkaar \\\\\\\\nslaan, maar na een paar keer zal hij je doden en moet je \\\\\\\\nopnieuw beginnen. Daarom is het handig als je het spel even \\\\\\\\nopslaat voordat je hem gaat slaan. Dit doe je door \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'bewaar \\\\\\\\nspel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' in te tikken. In de herberg is nu voorlopig niets meer \\\\\\\\nte doen, dus we gaan naar het bos.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAls je weer buiten staat, ga dan het bos in. Nu moet je even \\\\\\\\nronddwalen (ga west, ga noord etc.) tot je bij een boomhut \\\\\\\\nkomt. Hier kun je de voetafdrukken bekijken, en dan in de boom \\\\\\\\nklimmen. In de hut zul je een kapmes en een houten wig vinden. \\\\\\\\nGa weer omlaag, en probeer voor de grap eens in de boom te \\\\\\\\nsnijden.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGa dan het bos weer uit door weer op goed geluk allerlei \\\\\\\\nrichtingen op te lopen. Nu gaan we maar eens een kijkje nemen \\\\\\\\nin het kasteel!!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAls je het bos weer uit bent, ga dan naar het noorden en naar \\\\\\\\nhet kasteel. Als je een andere richting neemt, kom je weer in \\\\\\\\nhet bos. Als je voor het kasteel staat, kun je de tekst boven \\\\\\\\nde ingang lezen en dan naar binnen gaan. Binnen zul je een \\\\\\\\nharnas aantreffen. Als je erin wilt kruipen, moet je \"trek \\\\\\\\nharnas\" intypen. Als je daarna \"kijk vizier\" typt, zul je \\\\\\\\nvreemde dingen zien. Trek het harnas dan weer uit, want je \\\\\\\\nkunt er nu nog niet mee bewegen. Je kunt het wel meenemen, \\\\\\\\nmaar laten staan voor later is ook goed. Je kunt namelijk \\\\\\\\nmaar een beperkt aantal spullen meedragen. Je moet dus goed \\\\\\\\nopletten waar je dingen laat, zodat je ze later weer kunt \\\\\\\\nophalen als je ze nodig hebt. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEr is hier een deur, maar als je daar door loopt, kom je in \\\\\\\\neen kamer waar verder niets is te doen. Er is hier alleen \\\\\\\\neen lange tafel met etensresten. Ga de kamer uit, en loop de \\\\\\\\ntrap op. Je staat voor slaapkamer 2, maar de deur is niet \\\\\\\\nopen te krijgen. Als je naar het westen gaat, kom je bij \\\\\\\\nslaapkamer 1. Als je die ingaat, kun je naar een balkon. Als \\\\\\\\nje daar van af springt, ben je dood. Ga slaapkamer 1 weer \\\\\\\\nuit, en loop weer naar het oosten. Je bent dan weer bij \\\\\\\\nslaapkamer 2. Ga nu de nauwe gang zuidwaarts in. Je kunt \\\\\\\\nhier verschillende kanten op. Als je de wenteltrap omhoog \\\\\\\\ngaat, kom je in de kasteeltoren. Hier is een kist met een \\\\\\\\ngesloten luik. Nu kun je die nog niet openen. Ga door het \\\\\\\\nraam en je zult een waterbron in de verte zien. Vanaf nu kun \\\\\\\\nje bij die waterbron komen in het bos. Ga weer omlaag en dan \\\\\\\\nnog een keer omlaag. Je staat nu voor een geheimzinnige deur, \\\\\\\\nwaarop gebonkt wordt. Ook deze deur kun je nu nog niet \\\\\\\\nopenen. Als je weer omlaag gaat, kom je op de begraafplaats. \\\\\\\\nAls het goed is, is hier een lange ladder. Neem die mee. Je \\\\\\\\nkunt eventueel nog door het poortje gaan, om bij de graven \\\\\\\\nte kijken. Ga weer door het poortje en ga omhoog. Ga nogmaals \\\\\\\\nomhoog en zet dan de ladder neer, die zal tot het gat reiken. \\\\\\\\nKlim de ladder op en je bent in de spionageruimte. Ga naar \\\\\\\\nhet oosten. Je kunt nog verder naar het oosten, maar daar \\\\\\\\nloopt de gang dood. Ga terug en ga door het gat omlaag. Je \\\\\\\\nkomt in een ventilatieruimte, waar je verder niets kunt doen. \\\\\\\\nGa weer omhoog en twee keer naar het westen. Ga dan omhoog de \\\\\\\\nuitgehouwen trap op en kijk door het gat. Je zult Dracula \\\\\\\\nzien die in een kist stapt. Als je nog een keer kijkt zie je \\\\\\\\neen dichte kist staan. Klaarblijkelijk zit Dracula daar in, \\\\\\\\nmaar vergis je niet. Als je weer naar beneden gaat via de \\\\\\\\nladder zul je hem tegenkomen. Je kunt proberen hem te slaan, \\\\\\\\nschoppen of doden, maar dat haalt niets uit. Hij zal je \\\\\\\\naltijd doodbijten. Nee, de truc is dit: typ \"schijn dracula\", \\\\\\\\nen gooi dan de knoflook. Dracula zal met een plof verdwijnen, \\\\\\\\nmaar hij is nog niet dood!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNeem de ladder mee en ga nu het kasteel weer uit, - let op! \\\\\\\\nDe deur valt nu dicht en kan niet meer open!- en ga naar het \\\\\\\\ndorp. Je kunt nu naar de waterbron. Gooi de duivelaarsmunt \\\\\\\\nin de waterbron, en vul de fles met het giftige, blauwe \\\\\\\\nwater dat nu is ontstaan. Je kunt de munt ook weer meenemen \\\\\\\\nals je dat wilt. Als je behoefte hebt om nogmaals op de \\\\\\\\nzolder van de herberg te kijken, dan kan dat. Maar de waard \\\\\\\\nzal je er niet langs laten. Als je hem de munt geeft, wordt \\\\\\\\nhij weer wat rustiger en kun je op zolder kijken. Hier is \\\\\\\\nechter nog steeds niets te vinden. Ga weer naar je eigen \\\\\\\\nhuis en naar de slaapkamer. Als je nu gaat slapen, zul je \\\\\\\\nmidden in de nacht wakker worden door gebonk onder je bed. \\\\\\\\nSchijn met de lamp onder je bed en je ziet een open luik \\\\\\\\nzitten. Ga omlaag door het luik. Je zult een doosje en een \\\\\\\\nbijl aantreffen. Open het doosje en je vind een hamer. Pak \\\\\\\\nde bijl en ga weer omhoog. Ga naar het bos en zoek weer naar \\\\\\\\nde boomhut. Hak nu met de bijl een stuk hout uit de boom, \\\\\\\\nen raap dat op. Snij nu met het mes in het hout en het zal \\\\\\\\nde vorm van een kruis krijgen. Je kunt voor de lol met de \\\\\\\\nbijl ook huis gaan houden in de herberg. Als je de bijl \\\\\\\\ngooit zal de waard hem weer terug smijten enz.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGa weer naar je huis en zet de ladder neer onder het gat \\\\\\\\nboven je. Beklim de ladder en pak het touw dat daar ligt. \\\\\\\\nGa weer omlaag, neem de ladder mee en ga naar je slaapkamer. \\\\\\\\nKruip weer door het luik onder je bed. Pak de hamer en \\\\\\\\ngraaf met de schep naar het noorden tot je op iets hards \\\\\\\\nstoot. (De bijl heb je overigens niet meer nodig, evenals \\\\\\\\nhet mes, de lamp en de knoflook. Zorg dat je in ieder geval \\\\\\\\nde hamer en de wig hebt, het touw en de fles met giftig \\\\\\\\nwater.) Duw  de steen weg en ga door het ontstane gat. Je \\\\\\\\nbent nu weer in het kasteel en je stuit op de doodskist van \\\\\\\\nDracula. Open de kist en de klok zal twaalf uur slaan door \\\\\\\\nje pc speaker. Dracula opent de ogen en zal wegvluchten. \\\\\\\\nTyp nu telkens \"volg dracula\", totdat hij niet verder gaat \\\\\\\\nen hij voor je komt staan. Tijdens je achtervolging zul je \\\\\\\\nmerken dat je nu wel door het luik kunt gaan van de kist, \\\\\\\\ndie eerst dicht zat. Je komt dan in slaapkamer 2 waar je \\\\\\\\neerst niet in kon. Maar goed, Dracula staat op het punt je \\\\\\\\nweer aan te vallen. Als je de knoflook en de lamp nu zou \\\\\\\\ngebruiken haalt het niets meer uit. Nee, nu moet je het \\\\\\\\nhouten kruis tonen. Dracula zal angstig tegen de muur \\\\\\\\nopkruipen en de handen voor zijn ogen slaan. Sla dan de wig \\\\\\\\nmet de hamer door zijn hart en Dracula is dood!!!! Zijn \\\\\\\\nlijk zal tot stof vervallen en je kunt nog net het woord \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'incoronium\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' lezen. Vergeet ook niet om de gouden halsband \\\\\\\\nop te rapen die hier ergens ligt.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGa nu naar de kamer waar stond \"Dit is Sesam\". Typ nu de \\\\\\\\ntoverspreuk in die het lijk van Dracula achterliet en de \\\\\\\\ndeur zal opengaan. Je komt nu oog in oog te staan met een \\\\\\\\ngevaarlijke spin. Ook hier kun je proberen haar te doden maar \\\\\\\\ndat lukt niet. Je moet de fles met giftig water kapot gooien. \\\\\\\\nDe spin zal dan het water opdrinken en sterven. Als je \\\\\\\\nrondkijkt, zie je een vuur in deze kamer. Als je er doorheen \\\\\\\\nloopt, ga je dood. Je zult het harnas aan moeten trekken. \\\\\\\\n(Als je het niet bij je hebt, moet je het gaan halen) Je zult \\\\\\\\nmerken dat je je nu opeens wel kunt bewegen in het harnas. \\\\\\\\nLoop door het vuur heen en je komt in de geheime schatkamer. \\\\\\\\nHier staat een kist vol met gouden munten. Als je de kist \\\\\\\\noppakt zal het kasteel gaan schudden en beven. Het wordt tijd \\\\\\\\ndat je je uit de voeten gaat maken.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAls je weer terug bent gegaan door het vuur, moet je naar de \\\\\\\\nplek waar de doodskist van Dracula stond. Gooi alle voorwerpen \\\\\\\\ndie je bij je hebt weg, en pak de doodskist op. Ga nu naar \\\\\\\\nslaapkamer 1 en naar het balkon. Knoop daar het touw vast, ga \\\\\\\\nomlaag via het touw en zet de doodskist neer. Kruip nu in de \\\\\\\\ndoodskist en je zal met kist en al van de heuvel afglijden, zo \\\\\\\\nhet dorp in. Als je weer uit de kist bent gestapt heb je het \\\\\\\\nspel uitgespeeld. Je kunt nu gaan genieten van al je geld. \\\\\\\\nHoewel. Er lopen nog meer mannen rond in lange, zwarte \\\\\\\\njassen...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNB: Het is mogelijk bepaalde handelingen in een andere volgorde \\\\\\\\nte doen, en voorwerpen op andere plaatsen te laten etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeschreven door John Stigter aka Dj Dimwit.

To judge from its contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as \"The History of the Great Underground Empire\", \"The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads\", \"The Wisdom of the Implementers\", and other informative and inspiring works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground Empire, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure, and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon Master himself materializes beside you and says, \"Now that you have solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things. Long have I waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!\" He taps you lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells, and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped. For a moment there are two identical images staring at each other among the treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=========================================================\\\\\\\\nFAVORITE TREASURES:\\\\\\\\nHere are some of your own treasures to look at:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nexamine don woods\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+--v----v----v----v----v--+\\\\\\\\n|         _______         |\\\\\\\\n>  One   /       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\     G  <\\\\\\\\n| Lousy /         \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\    U  |\\\\\\\\n> Point |   ___   |    E  <\\\\\\\\n|       |  (___)  |       |\\\\\\\\n>           P  <\\\\\\\\n|       / /     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\    o  |\\\\\\\\n>      / /       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\   s  <\\\\\\\\n|     |-|---------|-|  t  |\\\\\\\\n>     | |  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ _ /  | |  a  <\\\\\\\\n|     | | --(_)-- | |  g  |\\\\\\\\n>     | |  /| |\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | |  e  <\\\\\\\\n|     |-|---|_|---|-|     |\\\\\\\\n>      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/ /      <\\\\\\\\n|       _/_______\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_       |\\\\\\\\n>      |  f.m.i.c. |      <\\\\\\\\n|      -------------      |\\\\\\\\n>                         <\\\\\\\\n|   Donald Woods, Editor  |\\\\\\\\n>     Spelunker Today     <\\\\\\\\n|                         |\\\\\\\\n+--^----^----^----^----^--+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n>examine flathead stamp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---V----V----V----V----V----V----V----V---\\\\\\\\n|                                        |\\\\\\\\n|          ||||||||||        LORD        |\\\\\\\\n>         !||||      |      DIMWIT       <\\\\\\\\n|         ||||    ---|     FLATHEAD      |\\\\\\\\n|         |||C     CC \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                  |\\\\\\\\n>          ||||       _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                 <\\\\\\\\n|           ||| (____|                   |\\\\\\\\n|            ||      |                   |\\\\\\\\n>             |______|       Our         <\\\\\\\\n|               /   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\     Excessive      |\\\\\\\\n|              /     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\      Leader       |\\\\\\\\n>             |       |                  <\\\\\\\\n|             |       |                  |\\\\\\\\n|                                        |\\\\\\\\n>    G.U.E.

Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west\\\\\\\\nWest: Prison cell\\\\\\\\n      There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them\\\\\\\\n      appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.\\\\\\\\n      You are trapped. But don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry, you have the return magic word.\\\\\\\\n      so... You are back to Great Hall\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,\\\\\\\\nand east where you can light it again.

Clara will give you her house keys and distract Dapper.\\\\\\\\nE to leave Sunrise Sushi.\\\\\\\\nGo North until you read \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98To the east is a small townhouse complex\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. This is Clara\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house.\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nYou can look around the place and wait until you hear an awful noise from the intercom.\\\\\\\\nPress blue button to let Clara in.\\\\\\\\nT Clara: 1 is a good option.\\\\\\\\nZ (Clara is off to have a shower)\\\\\\\\nZ\\\\\\\\nT Clara\\\\\\\\nBe a gentleman. When it comes to sleeping arrangements, volunteer to sleep on the beanbag. So, 2 is best.\\\\\\\\nYou get rewarded by Clara waking you up later. \\\\\\\\nKiss her. You can do so again, the dialogue continues. When it stops, make love to Clara.\\\\\\\\nWhen you both wake up, why not to talk her about the painting?\\\\\\\\nSoon enough, two thugs will arrive and give you 24 hours to pay back another debt, not related to Dapper at all. You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t attack them, you can only TALK TO LARGE THUG as he shoots his partner to make a point. How rude, Clara\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door and carpet are ruined.\\\\\\\\nNo matter what you say, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only there to warn you so you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be attacked. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll wait for Porn to arrive and Clara to get ready. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know which verb makes you help Porn in trying to put the wrecked door back on the hinges, sadly.\\\\\\\\nGoing North, North, East to Pizza Zoo is only for you to eat a slice, hear Clara and Porn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ideas for how to get started in making money and ask Porn what an upper-decker is if you really want to know. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a good friend, is Porn, but he has no taste.\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be stopping off at your place (Boggit Street, at the very top near the Copbot) and Porn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apartment (the apartment on Main Street). I tried going to Porn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place to pick up the honey jar before going to the pizza shop, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no use. Pick up your backpack and credit card, as that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where your earnings will be transferred.\\\\\\\\nIf you like you can go to the CopBot at the end of the road near Coffman, and E and N to Kim Street for the weapons store if you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t played before. You will soon know you need a weapon to enter the rest of New Haz and the price of the three guns available from the cheery people at the weapons store.\\\\\\\\nGo down Boggit Street, Rygarr Avenue and Main Street to Academy Videos. Your friend Tericho is there, fuming about being ripped off by a rude guy named Adrian Bates inside.\\\\\\\\nThis is a long slog with a random generation of bargain games. Save before you go in, you may get on a loop of the same wonderful game and this will make progressing impossible.\\\\\\\\nPUT ALL IN BACKPACK\\\\\\\\nTAKE GAMES to as much as you can hold.\\\\\\\\nX each game name will give Yar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s accurate review of it so you know which ones to GIVE TO CLERK so he can snigger himself to death.\\\\\\\\nThese are some of the bad ones that will make the uppity twerp eventually laugh himself into unconsciousness: Batman, Outpost, Night Trap, Reloaded, Tekwar, Tetris (relatively), Trespasser, Shadows of Cairn, Custer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Revenge, E.T., Dominion, Madden \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9997, Saied, Fork in the Tale, Sinister Six, World War II : On-Line, Crime Wave, Force Commander.\\\\\\\\nTo make things easier, put the good games in your backpack so you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re less likely to pick them up again from the bargain bin. They have no further use- selling is not an option as the pawn shop doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have staff, and you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to play them. Drop them if you like after Bates is sprawled on the ground.\\\\\\\\nTake Adrian Bates\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 card and give it to Porn get the register money transferred to your card. You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give Tericho the money he was owed, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s satisfied with your revenge.\\\\\\\\nNow, we have our money. Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go and get the electric pistol- the only weapon we can afford right now. Getting more deadly weapons is optional, but would probably make combat easier. Truth be told, only the electric pistol can be reloaded at the Ammobot, so no playing with bullets as you only get five. X PISTOL to get an idea if you need it reloaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMAKING MONEY IN NEW HAZ MADE EASY\\\\\\\\nGo to see Trotskie on Coffman Avenue. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s running a D&D game with your other friends that Porn will rudely interrupt, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell you that the morgue needs people to claim their corpses as there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too many. Talk to your other friends too if you like.\\\\\\\\nAt the morgue, there is a Creepy Guy in a porcupine suit. Claim your \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98brother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, and go west to check. When you come back out, Glavine will be trying to ruin things for you. You can tell him off, and then continue talking to the Creepy Guy to get your money. As tempting as it is to hit Glavine, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no point.\\\\\\\\nClara gets an idea to retrieve a film for the museum curator on Konrad Street. The theatre on Holden Street stole the film, so let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go there. No way to get in except:\\\\\\\\nATTACK WINDOW WITH PISTOL\\\\\\\\nS (make sure the cop doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you)\\\\\\\\nN \\\\\\\\nENTER WINDOW\\\\\\\\nUP \\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in the projection booth and have three film rolls: grey, black and silver. The silver one is the missing film, but you need to watch it to know. You can take the other ones and watch them too, by PUT (COLOUR) IN PROJECTOR and TURN PROJECTOR ON.\\\\\\\\n(I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve tried going into the pawn shop in a replay to see if you could sell the film, but no staff are available, so there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98evil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 option)\\\\\\\\nGo back to the museum and talk to the curator. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even need to officially get the mission first to get the reward.\\\\\\\\nKill Hitler. You can even get $75 for it! In an alley near Loome Street amongst the twisty passages, there is a bar to the south that you will find him in. I only needed to attack twice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJUST FOR FUN\\\\\\\\nEvery place normally has a joke attached to it, or a certain backstory if you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go into it. Go everywhere as Yar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s clever enough not to go into dangerous places.\\\\\\\\nThe tea room is Cheers without Alcohol.\\\\\\\\nDeath punches you in an alleyway near Holden. Attack Death once and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. You can still die in this game from other battles though, but Clara will find you even hotter.\\\\\\\\nThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bigby Burrito. Sometimes you will hear customers grumble in the never-moving queue, but you can hear some hints on what else can be done.\\\\\\\\nThe Hacker Hall of Shame is a museum with four exhibits.\\\\\\\\nThe Unitarian Hall plays a film after you go through a procedure.\\\\\\\\nYou can also play the Sega Saturn at Porn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place after the same procedure. Still got it!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOWBOY BEBOP\\\\\\\\nThe best freelance paycheque you can get is with four bounties. Dapper is listed, but not an option. Information on bounties is available at the Registrar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Office (X WANTED POSTER and T INFOBOT) and they can be collected at the Post Office (T CLERK). The missing poster shows that one Monica Simmons is very similar to our described Post Office Clerk, but this seems to be an aborted arc so you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to her about it or take the posters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSCOREZ\\\\\\\\nThis available bounty is unpleasant, but you can do so at any time and no risk to yourself.\\\\\\\\nAt any bus station, ENTER BUS.\\\\\\\\nIf you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember Scorez\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name from the Infobot, or got on the bus right away, Porn will see Scorez and point out how vile he is anyway. He needs to be stopped. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re unlikely to win a fight against Admiral Scorez, but you can keep the little girl he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to groom safe by talking to her.\\\\\\\\nTALK TO THE LITTLE GIRL. Do this twice. Telling her not to talk to strangers, and reminding her of your local hero status on the news works best, so option 2 is what you go with in both cases.\\\\\\\\nNow you have the little girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trust and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re her designated acquaintance to help her home. Scorez will angrily get off the bus and stand in front of it. His telephone conversation shows something terrible may happen to the bus, and the driver\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s furious.\\\\\\\\nTALK TO THE DRIVER. Do this twice.\\\\\\\\nThen you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll convince him to do the right thing: run over Scorez. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry about the little girl after this as she lives near Konrad Street and will get off shortly. I think there was an option to take her to her doorstep, but it was a deleted arc, sadly.\\\\\\\\nYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need to get on the bus again except for convenience. EXIT BUS at any stop you like. Go to the Post Office for your bounty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMCCORMICK\\\\\\\\nThis one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy to make the mistake of wanting him gone now and miss out on a few areas. No difference game-wise and you still get your bounty though. \\\\\\\\nGo to the Music Store to see your friend Vaughan. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to ATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL, move east, attack a few times before McCormick gives up and goes south. Vaughan is now safe, but make sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s okay. Go in, talk with him and get some money on your card and a hint to McCormick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next location. Go to the condemned building on Duffy Street, which is actually a front for cock-fighting. McCormick will go upstairs with some company.\\\\\\\\nIf you have some ree and your health is low, take it. If not, go to the dealer near the pawn shop on Grotto Street.\\\\\\\\nUP\\\\\\\\nATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL until he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. You can take his stuff, but surprisingly there is no need for the defibrillator. \\\\\\\\nIf you like you can T PROSTITUTE and escort her to a nightclub you conveniently can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t enter because you have no ID. Go to the Post Office to get your bounty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFAILED ROMERO\\\\\\\\nThis one takes place in the robotics shop on Konrad Street. ENTER STORE.\\\\\\\\nT WOMAN. Her name is Tera if you go for 1 first.\\\\\\\\nAGAIN until you snap and find out the reason for her curt attitude. Failed Romero, her creation, is returning.\\\\\\\\nPorn knows what to do. T PORN. You need to buy him some time.\\\\\\\\nT TERA but this fails to save her.\\\\\\\\nT ROMERO. Option 2.\\\\\\\\nT ROMERO. Option 2.\\\\\\\\nNo need to attack, he will be shut down.\\\\\\\\nEXIT STORE and return to the Post Office to collect your bounty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEANDRA\\\\\\\\nThis starts with a few small-cash jobs that will eventually give you the starting clue to collect her bounty. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to do all this in one go.\\\\\\\\nLightspeed Couriers\\\\\\\\nT CLERK. You need to get a handprint of the recipient on the scanner the clerk hands you to get paid and the package opened.\\\\\\\\nGo to the address in Holden. This is the battered low-income multiple housing complex on the east, between Holden and Loome.\\\\\\\\nThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing in this dirty living room except a keg which doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem much cleaner, given the way Porn reacts to the beer inside it. Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go into the kitchen, our tenant may be here.\\\\\\\\nENTER and EXIT are your verbs for the kitchen.\\\\\\\\nENTER KITCHEN\\\\\\\\nX BODY\\\\\\\\nWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not helpful for us. We just needed a handprint.\\\\\\\\nX LAPTOP (You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use it, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a CD drive)\\\\\\\\nEXIT KITCHEN\\\\\\\\nX KEG\\\\\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\\\\\nOPEN KEG\\\\\\\\nX BEER\\\\\\\\nNow, you probably already know what the pink bits are, but to retrieve it, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to LOOK INSIDE KEG and then TAKE HAND. PUT HAND ON SCANNER. Now the package is open. TAKE CD. You can ENTER KITCHEN and PUT CD IN LAPTOP. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nowhere to sell the information as I can tell. Now we can return to the couriers and get a small amount of cash for our work. Unfortunately, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sell the hand to the morgue after you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re done.\\\\\\\\nGetting Borick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cheque\\\\\\\\nGo to the tattoo parlour. Borick will be complaining to Jake about someone who owes him a cheque. So, TALK TO BORICK about it. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll give you a name and mention the guy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a college student, though he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give you a tattoo.\\\\\\\\nLook up the name on the Infobot. Do we know any students? Not very well, as he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dead. Since Yar prints out a pre-decomposition photo of him, we have the basis of our identity theft.\\\\\\\\nGo to the Living Mask store. Remember to take your credit card and have it in your hand when you ask the talented man to help you. Our guy will take a few turns to get the mask done, so you might as well do some of the other jobs and bounties before coming back. \\\\\\\\nWEAR MASK\\\\\\\\nGo to the Post Office. T CLERK to get the cheque.\\\\\\\\nBeing honest with your employer is the best policy, as it was with the film roll. Go back to the Tattoo Parlour. Give the cheque to Borick, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll give you a pager and tell your trustworthy self about a goal of his: tattooing the hacker Leandra Jones in revenge. If you find her, page him and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll arrive in a few turns- and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll still get your bounty. \\\\\\\\nGiving you Leandra\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s full name is a valuable tip, so go to the Infobot for her last-known address.\\\\\\\\nYou can finally enter the townhouse on the very west point of Loome Street. Knock on the door and the sobbing guy will let you open it.\\\\\\\\nThe sobbing guy is Mitchell, Leandra\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ex-boyfriend.\\\\\\\\nT MITCHELL. Ask \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where is she now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 to hasten the process. Clara will slap some sense into him. Leandra\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s moved to Pang Street, east of here. Remember that apartment we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get into? You can beat up Mitchell afterwards, but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no point.\\\\\\\\nIf you aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t full on health, buying some Ree would be smart before you go any further.\\\\\\\\nWhen you get to Pang Street, get your pistol out of your backpack. The door is to the north.\\\\\\\\nKNOCK ON DOOR\\\\\\\\nOh great, another thug answers.\\\\\\\\nENTER APARTMENT\\\\\\\\nUP\\\\\\\\nUP\\\\\\\\nYou have to get rid of the thug before you can enter Leandra\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apartment anyway. ATTACK THUG WITH PISTOL and AGAIN until he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone. If you need to escape to take some Ree, go DOWN.\\\\\\\\nENTER APARTMENT\\\\\\\\nAs soon as you can see Leandra, ACTIVATE PAGER.\\\\\\\\nWhatever you say won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter, but to keep Leandra in her apartment until Borick arrives, you may have to attack her a few times right after she rummages her drawer and removes another problem.\\\\\\\\nBorick will show up, knock her out for you if you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t done so already, have his revenge and give you some cash.\\\\\\\\nEXIT APARTMENT\\\\\\\\nDOWN \\\\\\\\nDOWN\\\\\\\\nEXIT APARTMENT\\\\\\\\nGo back to the Post Office to collect your bounty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPorn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Donation Drive\\\\\\\\nGo to the Medical Centre. The receptionist will take Porn to another room for his regular visit, so you might as well X MAGAZINE while you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re waiting and learn about neurosurgery. No more pussy-footing. If you can get your head fixed you can easily make the money you need and experience the joys of electronics. Porn will generously give you the $25 from his monthly donation and then you can TALK TO THE RECEPTIONIST. 1 will tell her all of your troubles and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get a quote for the surgery to help you if you keep talking to her. If you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve followed this walkthrough in the order of writing, this won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be a problem.\\\\\\\\nInternet Caf\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\\\\\\\\nHere you can put your skills to the test. One terminal is free.\\\\\\\\nUSE COMPUTER. You haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lost your touch.\\\\\\\\nSoon after this, if you go back to this area again after a few turns, Johnny Dapper will appear and either take $2331 if you have it or the CD you copied if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shoot him or talk your way out of it. Porn will then suggest you either sell your CD of code (or intercept Dapper selling it) at the pawn shop. So, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ready to end the conflict, head there.\\\\\\\\nReading time!\\\\\\\\nTALK TO NEVE \\\\\\\\nA guard will appear who seems like bad news, but is fulfilling a new contract from Porn. You now have a cable.\\\\\\\\nPLUG CABLE INTO TERMINAL lets you see where Neve is now, and tells you of an upcoming guard. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to wait a few turns but now you know. You can ATTACK GUARD WITH CABLE to knock him out, but ATTACK GUARD is the only thing you need.\\\\\\\\nHere, ENTER and EXIT are your verbs for all rooms. Outside of the cell, there is a darkened room with an energy pak, west has another storage room with your pistol, and a cafeteria with one guy who recognises you.\\\\\\\\nTALK TO BILLY. Billy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sympathetic and won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hurt you.  Talk to him about everything.\\\\\\\\nPUT PAK INTO PISTOL. As far as attacking anyone with the pistol goes, remember you need one charge remaining before you go into the front hall.\\\\\\\\n Go west to the stairwell. Upstairs first.\\\\\\\\nGo to the lab at the west end. ATTACK NEVE WITH PISTOL. TAKE ALL. You can use her keypass to enter storage for some ree and horror when you remove the sheet.\\\\\\\\nDownstairs:\\\\\\\\nYou can go into Neve\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s office by unlocking the door with her keypass, but this is more for poignancy than for helping you escape. At the east end of the hall, use Neve\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pass to unlock the door to the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\\\\\nATTACK PAD WITH PISTOL to survive. Then ATTACK DOCTOR WITH PISTOL until it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s over. If you have only one charge left, just ATTACK. TAKE ALL, as you need to unlock the reception door with the pass and free money will help with your trip. The ree\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nice too.\\\\\\\\nWhen you go into reception after unlocking the door, SHOOT CHANDELIER. \\\\\\\\nEXIT. \\\\\\\\nW. \\\\\\\\nUNLOCK GARAGE DOOR WITH PASS.\\\\\\\\nENTER GARAGE.\\\\\\\\nThis is it. This part of the garage houses the door to your escape from all of New Haz. \\\\\\\\nX LOG BOOK- the doctor drives the Porsche.\\\\\\\\nYour friends are now here. Porn will be warning you of the guards trying to shoot their way in, so get busy. T CLARA. Both will get the strongbox open, but 1 means she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go with you even though it hurts. It would hurt a lot more not to tell the truth and 1 saves you a turn.\\\\\\\\nTAKE WIRELESS (the wireless key fob is for the Porsche). \\\\\\\\nUNLOCK HIGHWAY DOOR WITH BANK CARD to pay off your fictional, final debt and open the door.\\\\\\\\nPRESS WIRELESS to open the Porsche doors. Make sure you have taken the wireless as sometimes you can press the button without doing so, and then waste a few turns not realising why you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t drive the car and having to get out to get the keys.\\\\\\\\nENTER PORSCHE\\\\\\\\nDRIVE PORSCHE into your first dawn ever seen, with your girlfriend by your side and your mate cheering you on (who hopefully escapes later).\\\\\\\\n\\']\"b\\'[\"Solution To Farmers Daughter (finally)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n                           Wednesday, 14th October, 1998.\\\\\\\\n                                     Version 1.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreamble\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        Farmer\\\\\\'s daughter is an old text adventure for the commodore 64 circa\\\\\\\\n1988.

This shows, sometimes badly.\\\\\\\\nTechnically, the program is rather restrictive. There are no command recall\\\\\\\\nfacilities, not even the ones used by the DOS command line. At least capitals\\\\\\\\nare accepted, but never significant. The most unpleasant lack, though, is that\\\\\\\\nyou cannot save your game. At least it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not very long.\\\\\\\\n  As far as vocabulary is concerned, it has what it needs and nothing more.\\\\\\\\nOnly the first three letters of a word are significant, except where they\\\\\\\\naren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t - see below. Some abbreviations are recognised, and some are required;\\\\\\\\nspecifically, \"east\" is only recognised as a full word in \"go east\", not on its\\\\\\\\nown. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to use \"e\". This one limitation is not very onerous, of\\\\\\\\ncourse. Also, you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use \"it\".\\\\\\\\n  Another limitation is that this program is very bad for guess-the-verb. At\\\\\\\\ntimes, it even needs guess-the-exact-command. Synonyms are not common. \"Get\"\\\\\\\\nand \"Take\" will both work, and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about it except where a special case has\\\\\\\\nbeen accounted for. But those pre-defined commands have their foibles, one of\\\\\\\\nwhich is is that they do not always recognise abbreviated words. Some work with\\\\\\\\na three-letter abbreviation but not with a four-letter one. Some demand the\\\\\\\\nentire noun but allow the verb to be abbreviated; some do not. Using the entire\\\\\\\\nwords in all commands would be best, which makes it all the more inconsistent\\\\\\\\nthat \"east\" is not recognised on its own. And, of course, where I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve used \"the\"\\\\\\\\nbelow to make the text read better, omit it.\\\\\\\\n  Those special cases have another problem: they are not accepted except in the\\\\\\\\nvery circumstances for which they have been anticipated. Everywhere else they\\\\\\\\nwill be treated as if you typed nonsense, or give a non-committal message such\\\\\\\\nas \"nothing happens\" where \"that is not here\" would be a more appropriate.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, \"look object\" and \"read object\" are not the same thing even where\\\\\\\\nthey should be - in at least one case, \"look object\" says \"nothing to be read\",\\\\\\\\nbut \"read object\" tells you what is written on it!\\\\\\\\n  Real bugs are, as far as I have found, rare. That is to say, bugs which\\\\\\\\naffect gameplay seem rare. You need to be careful not to lose your dog before\\\\\\\\nyou get him - that seems to be all. Cosmetic bugs are much more common. One or\\\\\\\\ntwo messages seem incomplete, but the most common bug is that room descriptions\\\\\\\\nremain static when they shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t - objects remain in view when you take them,\\\\\\\\nthat sort of thing. Misspelled words are also common.\\\\\\\\n  Finally, since this is a walkthrough, spoilers are rife below. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not taking\\\\\\\\nyou past every single clue and sight - in fact, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not taking you past any.\\\\\\\\nAll code numbers I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be giving you can be found in the game somewhere. As\\\\\\\\nmentioned above, the Look and Read commands are not always helpful, but they do\\\\\\\\noccasionally reveal something useful. Therefore, look at everything before you\\\\\\\\nresort to this walkthrough, and if you accidentally read the solution to a\\\\\\\\nproblem you hadn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t come across yet, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t blame me.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Now, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go and get that treasure.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  You start in Getfeldt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s garden. Go east, take the crowbar, and go west and\\\\\\\\nsouth. Use the crowbar. (Yes, \"use\". Tsk, tsk... naughty implementor.) Drop the\\\\\\\\ncrowbar. Open door, go east and north. Move the painting. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re asked for a\\\\\\\\ncombination, which is 121513. Yes, a hint this can be found elsewhere in the\\\\\\\\ngame. No, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not telling you where. Serves you right for reading walkthroughs.\\\\\\\\nTake and wear the amulet.\\\\\\\\n  Go s, s, e. Open the refrigerator (\"fridge\" is not recognised) and take the\\\\\\\\nsteak. Go east. Now (and you must enter this as one command, nor will you be\\\\\\\\nallowed to proceed until you do) \"give steak\". Get the treats, and give treat.\\\\\\\\nIf you now check your inventory, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find that you are carrying the dog!\\\\\\\\n  Pull the lever and go down. Take the gear and the balloon. Go east twice.\\\\\\\\nUnlock the door - the code is 6603243e. Go east twice more, then north and up.\\\\\\\\nStart the engine and set the navigation. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be asked for the coordinates,\\\\\\\\nwhich are 121.15.09:34.09.12 - and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve already come across these, although\\\\\\\\nI haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t told you explicitly where to find them. \\\\\\\\n  Go east twice. Wear your gear, then go down and north. First turn the wheel,\\\\\\\\nthen the handle. Go east. Close the door, and when asked which, enter /~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\I\\\\\\\\n(slash, tilde, backslash, single I: the \"one\" version of the visible door\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\n\"two\"). Now \"push green\". Do not \"push green pad\" - that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work. Turn\\\\\\\\nthe cross.\\\\\\\\n  Go east, look shelf, take batteries, go east, take flashlight. Go south. Put\\\\\\\\nbatteries in flashlight. Drop the flashlight, batteries (yes, you have to drop\\\\\\\\nthem individually even though you just put them in the flashlight), balloon,\\\\\\\\ngear and treats. Go west. Put amulet in star, get chest, go east. No, all your\\\\\\\\nstuff hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t disappeared. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still here, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just not shown in the room\\\\\\\\ndescription.\\\\\\\\n  Take the gear and balloon - leave the rest. Go back n, w, w. Take the net.\\\\\\\\nWear the gear. Close the door - enter /~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\II, that is, slash, tilde, backslash,\\\\\\\\ndouble I - push red and go west. Put chest in net. Attach net. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be asked\\\\\\\\n\"to what\" - enter \"ring\", as a single word. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t ask me why this command could\\\\\\\\nnot be handled in the same way as \"put object in object\", but if you try that,\\\\\\\\nyou get told to \"slow down\". Pull the tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Hooray - you have beaten Getfeldt. Although there are messages spread around\\\\\\\\nthe game which make it uncertain how much you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve actually \"beaten\" him and how\\\\\\\\nmuch of it was his idea all along. In any case, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re now rich, so no matter\\\\\\\\nwho was the mastermind, it counts as a victory for you!\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'(version 1.0 of this walkthrough -- 11/12/03)\\\\\\\\n(by Daphne Brinkerhoff -- cendare@hotmail.com)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWALKTHROUGH FOR GHOST TRAIN\\\\\\\\n                -----------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Ghost Train_, by Paul Johnson, is available at\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttp://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/ghost.z8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(you may need to watch for line breaks in the above URL)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis file is a little discursive, including some actions which are not\\\\\\\\nnecessary to complete the game. However, they should make the experience\\\\\\\\nmore enjoyable. The exact phrases you will need to type into the\\\\\\\\ninterpreter are in ALL CAPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis walkthrough is based on\\\\\\\\nRelease 4 / Serial number 070503 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nON THE FIRST TRAIN\\\\\\\\n------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically your goal is to wait around a few turns. READ NEWSPAPER, TALK\\\\\\\\nTO INGRID, KISS INGRID, and be sure to X INGRID. She\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wearing a\\\\\\\\nnecklace; X NECKLACE. You can take INVENTORY and X TICKET too. Whatever\\\\\\\\nyou do, after a few turns there will be an accident.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAFTER THE ACCIDENT\\\\\\\\n------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in \"blackness. A sleepy unconscious state.\" You want to WAKE.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLook at the wreckage! No, really, LOOK AT WRECKAGE. You can X BODIES, X\\\\\\\\nDEBRIS, SEARCH BODIES, and SEARCH DEBRIS too, but it won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get you\\\\\\\\nanything nifty. Instead go SOUTH. (You could go north, but it would only\\\\\\\\ntake you to an endless set of tracks, so why bother?) X LIGHT and X BOX\\\\\\\\nhere, then go WEST, UP, and WEST again to enter the signal box. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nsee a ghostly train go by beneath you, but you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to worry about\\\\\\\\nit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWell, you were looking for a phone, so X PHONE and it tells you how to\\\\\\\\nuse it. TURN HANDLE for some more atmosphere. Next, look at other things\\\\\\\\naround you. X NECKLACE (look familiar?), X COIN, X LEVER, X PANEL. You\\\\\\\\ncan GET the COIN and NECKLACE. You can PULL and PUSH the LEVER, but I\\\\\\\\ndon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think it does anything useful. Notice that the panel is loosely\\\\\\\\nattached--PULL PANEL, then LOOK to see what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve uncovered. GET KEY.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all here, so EAST, DOWN, and EAST to get back to the tracks. The\\\\\\\\nstrange figure you saw earlier has left a lamp. X LAMP and GET IT. Go on\\\\\\\\nto the SOUTH. You can X WALLS and X LICHEN for some more atmosphere, and\\\\\\\\nyou can even X WATER and DRINK WATER. Then go SOUTH again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the writing on the door? READ WRITING. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY and\\\\\\\\ngo WEST into...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo NORTH so you can interact with things.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX CLOCK, X POSTERS, READ SIGN. Notice that the train comes at 10:30 and\\\\\\\\nthe clock thinks it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 10:24 right now. Then go NORTH into the waiting\\\\\\\\nroom.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ghost will call your name, but you can ignore it for a moment. X\\\\\\\\nBOOKS, READ BOOKS, READ NEWSPAPER, X SOFA, SIT ON SOFA will all give you\\\\\\\\nmore atmospheric messages. Then you can deal with the ghost. X WINDOW\\\\\\\\nand wait a turn, then the ghost asks \"Fares Please\". Then X GHOST. He\\\\\\\\nwants you to buy a ticket, so GIVE COIN TO GHOST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, notice the clock is ticking again--at 10:30 the train will be out\\\\\\\\nat the track. But spare a second to X TICKET to see where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\ngoing... a cemetery... brrr. Then go SOUTH and wait until the train\\\\\\\\narrives. Once it does, go SOUTH again to enter it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nON THE SECOND TRAIN\\\\\\\\n-------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPay attention to the colors of the carriages here, and write them down\\\\\\\\nin order. It will come in handy later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn room #1 (the westernmost room) is a red door which is locked. In room\\\\\\\\n#6 is a locked door.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso in that room is a Ouija board. If you hang around a moment, the\\\\\\\\nspirits will spell out \"HELP US\" on the board. X BOARD--you can ask it\\\\\\\\nabout things just as though it were a real person. Sometime about now,\\\\\\\\nyou may get strange messages about mice running through the room, or you\\\\\\\\nmay hear footsteps on the roof of the train. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s okay. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just\\\\\\\\nrandom atmospheric stuff.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo ahead and ASK BOARD ABOUT whatever you can think of, including: ME,\\\\\\\\nTRAIN, GHOST, TICKET. But to continue, you must ASK BOARD ABOUT INGRID,\\\\\\\\nand the door to your east will open. Go EAST and be confronted by a dead\\\\\\\\nman rotting. Make sure you read his description carefully, especially\\\\\\\\nthe mention of his badge. You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually interact with him yet,\\\\\\\\nthough. Notice the key--X BLACK KEY and GET IT. *Now* you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve woken up\\\\\\\\nthe dead guy. GIVE TICKET TO GHOST and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll leave you alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn to room #1 (go WEST six times) and UNLOCK DOOR WITH BLACK KEY.\\\\\\\\nThen go WEST twice to enter the train\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cab. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see a bunch of\\\\\\\\ncontrols, which you may want to fiddle with yourself before continuing\\\\\\\\nwith this walkthrough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour goal is to get the train to stop. The brake wheel looks\\\\\\\\npromising--TURN BRAKE WHEEL. That slowed it, but didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t stop it. PULL\\\\\\\\nLEVER to finish the job. Then DOWN to get out of the train.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCEMETERY AND CHAPEL\\\\\\\\n-------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo NORTH to the cemetery proper. X STONES and it mentions a particular\\\\\\\\ninscription. READ INSCRIPTION--you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want it to be true, but it is.\\\\\\\\nIngrid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gone. Unless... NORTHWEST takes you to a fairy dance. X\\\\\\\\nDANCERS, and then go NORTH to the chapel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX CHAPEL and NORTH takes you inside. X INSCRIPTION. X BIBLE and try to\\\\\\\\nGET IT. You can X PEWS and X LECTERN too, if you want. Then go EAST to\\\\\\\\nthe bell room. An empty room, except for that rope. You can PULL ROPE to\\\\\\\\nring the bell, but it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do much for you. X ROPE hints at the\\\\\\\\nproper thing to do... You want to CLIMB ROPE.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(I like to PULL ROPE again when I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m at the top of it, right next to the\\\\\\\\nbell. But then, I read Dorothy Sayers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' _Nine Tailors_.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe language here is a little weird. GET PARCHMENT and then X PARCHMENT.\\\\\\\\nX BOOKS tells you to search for things by name... You saw the name of\\\\\\\\nthe church is St. Gorgon (although it was spelled differently), so\\\\\\\\nSEARCH GORGON and GET EXORCISM. READ EXORCISM for some colorful\\\\\\\\nlanguage, but nothing else of use. CLIMB ROPE to get back down (\"down\"\\\\\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work, for some reason). WEST and SOUTH to leave the chapel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, you want to go around back. So NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST. X GARGOYLE\\\\\\\\nand READ INSCRIPTION. Aha, a clue. Go back to the dancers by going\\\\\\\\nSOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, then SOUTH. Then ASK DANCERS ABOUT GARGOYLE. The\\\\\\\\ndancer will kiss you, so I like to KISS DANCERS in return. Then go back\\\\\\\\nto the chapel and do what the dancers said--three times around,\\\\\\\\ncounterclockwise. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll end up in back of the chapel having a chat with\\\\\\\\nSatan.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHe asks who dares to call him back; TELL SATAN ABOUT ME. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve only got\\\\\\\\none thing on your mind, so ASK SATAN ABOUT INGRID. Uh-oh, is there any\\\\\\\\nway to save her? ASK SATAN ABOUT HELL. (If this is clued, I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know\\\\\\\\nwhere.) Obviously you have to answer \"YES\". Satan gives you an hour (60\\\\\\\\nturns) to do what must be done.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou end up at a funeral service, before an open grave. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no reason\\\\\\\\nto know this, but you have to ENTER OPEN GRAVE. DOWN takes you to a pair\\\\\\\\nof eyes, asking about you. TELL EYES ABOUT ME and then go WEST. X HOUND\\\\\\\\nto get his name. Pluto (and you can try to go down if you want, but\\\\\\\\nhe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll stop you). Go back EAST and ASK EYES ABOUT PLUTO. Now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s safe to\\\\\\\\ngo WEST and DOWN. DOWN again, and EAST to... yet another train.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE THIRD TRAIN\\\\\\\\n---------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX SWITCH to see which way the train is headed now (northeast), then UP\\\\\\\\nto enter the train.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOPEN BOX to get a message from Ingrid telling you your goal, then go\\\\\\\\nNORTH to this train\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe controls are mostly the same as the other train, except that you\\\\\\\\nmust turn the switch to face northwest first, using the colored levers.\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where the colors of the second train come in handy... Pull the\\\\\\\\ncolored levers in the order that the carriages were colored in that\\\\\\\\ntrain (type PULL RED, PULL BLUE, etc.). I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually think it\\\\\\\\nchanges with each game--I think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s always RRBBGR (R = red, B = blue, G\\\\\\\\n= green).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you just have to get the train moving. Remember how the other one\\\\\\\\nwas stopped? Well, do those things in reverse. PUSH REGULATOR LEVER and\\\\\\\\nTURN BRAKE WHEEL.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you read the plaque, it will give you a hint how you can escape the\\\\\\\\ndemon: TURN DAMPER, twice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCongratulations, you win!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'Solution to \"Groove Billygoat\" by Efrain Finnell\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the \"quick and dirty\" walkthrough that skips a lot of detail.\\\\\\\\nThere is some randomness you may need to account for.\\\\\\\\nIt is suggested you use the in-game hints (type HINT) before resorting\\\\\\\\nto the walkthrough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst:\\\\\\\\nGO IN\\\\\\\\nGO OUT\\\\\\\\nWAIT (for about 15 turns or fiddle with your inventory)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Orphans will escape and Betsy will start singing you a song.

Wait\\\\\\\\nfor him to go in to the Badder Part of Town and follow him (GO IN).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe StepEasy will now be apparent. Say the password SHAMONE and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nget inside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(This is determined by asking one of the orphans about JAMON which is\\\\\\\\nwhat you thought the Thin Man said.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTAKE OFF COAT\\\\\\\\nGIVE COAT TO GIRL (You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get a coatcheck marker.)\\\\\\\\nNORTHWEST\\\\\\\\nWEST\\\\\\\\nMOONWALK NORTH\\\\\\\\nPUT MARKER IN BEAM\\\\\\\\nTAKE DIFFERENT MARKER\\\\\\\\nNORTH\\\\\\\\nEAST\\\\\\\\nSOUTHEAST\\\\\\\\nGIVE MARKER TO GIRL (You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get the Thin Man\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s left glove.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo get to the northeast quadrant where the stairs up are, you must\\\\\\\\ndance.

You can either\\\\\\\\nwait for the Thin Man to throw a coin in the jukebox, put the coin you\\\\\\\\nfound in the trash can in the jukebox if you didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t give it to the bum,\\\\\\\\nor HIT JUKEBOX Fonzie-style to start the music.

You get 20 points for each object, so your score level will\\\\\\\\ntell you whether you have got a correct item.\\\\\\\\nSome of the artifacts are useless, except for scoring purposes, but\\\\\\\\nothers are needed to solve puzzles in the game.\\\\\\\\nTo get the Vogon ship to fly, read the book of poetry in the Vogon\\\\\\\\nNavigation room (where the poetry is graffitti\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d on the wall).\\\\\\\\nTo get the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Heart of Gold\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' to fly, drop the rusty old engine in the\\\\\\\\ncontrol room and push the lever (As the sign says: Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t pull the\\\\\\\\nlever).\\\\\\\\nGet the babel fish before giving the Arkleseizure a drink.\\\\\\\\nUse the coin to buy the chocolate first - don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use it on the Nutrimat\\\\\\\\nuntil you have the chocolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- - - - - - \\\\\\\\n2/  HH-64 Walkthrough\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Note: if you prefer the solution to be compacted into fewer lines, just\\\\\\\\nhighlight the text and replace all the line breaks with commas.]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nGet bowl\\\\\\\\nDrop bowl\\\\\\\\nLook\\\\\\\\nGet keys\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nU\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nGet steak\\\\\\\\nGet gun\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nD\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nOn gun\\\\\\\\nU\\\\\\\\nShoot Vogon (or Shoot captain)\\\\\\\\n[The gun is only used to shoot Vogons.

As soon as I saw the first line (\"Hi there, guys, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m Bugsy,\\\\\\\\nyour lovable computer companion.\"), I knew it was the same game -\\\\\\\\nespecially since \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Bob Chappell\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Supersoft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' appear in reverse video\\\\\\\\non the screen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you play this game, you will see that it is exactly the same game as\\\\\\\\nHH-64.  The only differences are that the reference to Douglas Adams and\\\\\\\\nPan Books has been removed, and all the objects and places have been\\\\\\\\nsuperficially renamed.  However, it is obvious by the names that the\\\\\\\\nHitch Hikers Guide version came first:  all the Cosmic Capers names keep\\\\\\\\nthe same kind of format (for want of a better term): the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'bowl of\\\\\\\\npetunias\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' becomes a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'vase of pansies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of\\\\\\\\nTraal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' becomes the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', and so on.  And it\\\\\\\\nis unlikely that Cosmic Capers was first with the idea of bad alien\\\\\\\\npoetry!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, if you want to solve \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Cosmic Capers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', just follow the walkthrough\\\\\\\\nand use the appropriate nouns (eg, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'SHOOT VERRUCAN rather than SHOOT\\\\\\\\nVOGON).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- - - - - - \\\\\\\\n4/ Miscellaneous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI was stuck on this game for a very long time (somewhere between 13 - 14\\\\\\\\nyears, in fact, but this included several years without a C64).  I\\\\\\\\nfinally found the solution on a disk of adventure game solutions created\\\\\\\\nusing the Vizawrite 64 word processor.  I loaded up \"The Hitch Hikers\"\\\\\\\\nfile to test the disk, expecting it to be the solution for the Infocom\\\\\\\\ngame, and was bowled over when it turned out to be a walkthrough for the\\\\\\\\nSupersoft title!  Being in an 80 column format (on a 40 column screen),\\\\\\\\nI had to take two screen dumps and then stick them together in order to\\\\\\\\nprint the solution out.  When I got home, however, I found that the\\\\\\\\nwalkthrough missed a number of steps - a fairly common problem when\\\\\\\\npeople write solutions down as they play the game.  Having used the\\\\\\\\nsolution to get past my sticking point, I managed to finish the game\\\\\\\\nwith a bit of judicious mapping.  I must say that after having waited so\\\\\\\\nmany years, the ending was quite a disappointment!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a Spectrum version of this game (HH-64), which states it is (c)\\\\\\\\nEstuary Software Products.  It does not say who the programmer was, or\\\\\\\\nwhat year it was made.  There is also no reference to whether ESP and\\\\\\\\nSupersoft are the same software house, or one version was licensed from\\\\\\\\nthe other.  I have always wondered whether HH-64 was  truly a piece of\\\\\\\\ncommercial software, or if the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'by kind permission\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' line was just a bit\\\\\\\\nof fun added to a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'tribute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' game by some keen fan.  However, it is\\\\\\\\nstrange to find a non-commercial game popping up on two separate\\\\\\\\nplatforms (unless one was just a home-attempt on one platform at\\\\\\\\nreproducing the commercial version from another platform?).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA post was made on internet news in Nov-Dec 98 by a person who claimed\\\\\\\\nto have programmed an intro to the game.  They were looking for a copy\\\\\\\\nof the file as they couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find it anywhere on the internet.  Having\\\\\\\\nsearched both comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm, I have not been able\\\\\\\\nto find a copy of this post either to reproduce it here or obtain the\\\\\\\\nposters e-mail address in order to get more information from them.\\\\\\\\nPossibly the question was posted on rec.arts.int-fiction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nObviously HH-64 had to have been released before Infocom got the rights\\\\\\\\nto create a HHG game.  According to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Infocom Fact Sheet VIII:\\\\\\\\nChronology\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' by Paul David Doherty, the Infocom HHG was released in\\\\\\\\nOctober 1984.  I have a note that I bought my copy of this game in\\\\\\\\nAugust 1985 (compiled 21st December 1984, if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re interested).  My\\\\\\\\npreliminary map for HH-64 appears before this entry in my map book, and\\\\\\\\nit is dated \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'1st May\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.  Whether that is 1984 or 1985 I cannot tell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo information on HH-64 can be found on the Adventure Games List\\\\\\\\nmaintained by Hans Persson and kept on ftp.gmd.de at\\\\\\\\nif-archive/info/adventure-game-history.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n/Andrew.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\"[\\'General tips:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBest weapons:\\\\\\\\ncleaver (village, in store) strength 10\\\\\\\\nbattleaxe (eastern forest, grass roof hut) strength 18\\\\\\\\nfire whip (mystic cave, held by golem) strength 22\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost wearables has no effect, but the armor and shield (village, paladin)\\\\\\\\noccasionally heal you, and the cloak (elf) occasionally increases your damage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two NPCs who can help you in combat\\\\\\\\nWerewolf (in mansion)\\\\\\\\nTursk (in caverns)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEating the rations (village, tavern) will give you an extra 200 hp and refill\\\\\\\\nyour food count.

Sometimes, in-game events may lead to a special speech option or opportunity if one is in your party at the time, so I will note those throughout this walkthrough using the following symbols:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 Marlowe\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x96 Lich Battlemaster\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x86 Daechiron\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, some situations play out differently depending on your class. These will be denoted by the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nR Rogue\\\\\\\\nW Warrior\\\\\\\\nM Mage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, it is theoretically possible to completely fill the in-game BESTIARY with every enemy. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 will denote options that allow you to do this, if you have this as a goal and the enemy can otherwise be easily missed. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---Contents---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ni. Prologue\\\\\\\\nii. Lornely Forest\\\\\\\\niii. Eastern Hold \\\\\\\\niv. Southern Hold\\\\\\\\nv. Bestiary/Enemy Guide\\\\\\\\nvi. Item Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---Prologue: Gameplay Overview and Character Creation--\\\\\\\\nThe essentials of gameplay are also described in the in-game HELP SECTION. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCombat is turn-based. You can use spells or skills, which deplete your MP or SP respectively. When fully depleted, you can only use your basic attack, which is modified according to your equipped weapon. An enemy may have a single weakness and/or a single immunity. If the skill, spell, or weapon you use has a type that matches the enemy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s weakness, it will do double damage. However, if it matches the enemy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s immunity, it will do no damage. Once an enemy has been defeated, its information and description, including weaknesses and immunities, can be viewed from the BESTIARY in the MENU. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA companion may help you in combat each turn, though you have the option to tell them to hold back, meaning they will not make a move that turn. If told to attack, the companion will use a random one of their known moves on the enemy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROS: \\\\\\\\n-weaknesses and immunities do not apply to a companion\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s moves\\\\\\\\n-companions do not deplete their SP/MP\\\\\\\\n-the foe will never target a companion, meaning they cannot take damage in combat\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCONS:\\\\\\\\n-companions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' skillsets are fixed; you cannot change their skills/spells or equipment\\\\\\\\n-IF A COMPANION KILLS THE FOE, YOU WILL EARN NO XP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe last bullet is essentially a mechanism to prevent your companion from becoming a crutch for the entire game. While your companion can easily destroy earlier enemies, you will find that even with your companion attacking later-game enemies will kill you easily. To prevent this, the best strategy is to earn XP by finishing enemies yourself. Many foes, especially early-game enemies, can be tackled on your own. Use your companion to strategically weaken tougher foes, but be cautious to always save the last blow for yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can speak to companions at any time from the MENU. They will offer insight or commentary about your current location, and you can have deeper conversations with them that will change their relationships with you. Companions will also have unique dialogue for each location of the game. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the MENU, you can access your INVENTORY, where you can view descriptions of items, equip them, or use them. Each \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'chapter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' of the game contains a shop somewhere, and at these shops you can sell items you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need or want, or buy new stuff. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are three main \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'chapters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' of the game. As the game warns you, once you move on, you cannot return to a previous chapter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s area. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can recruit a single companion at a time. You can dismiss your companion at any time, but if dismissed, a companion will leave your game and cannot be found and recruited again. A companion can be spoken to at any time from your MENU. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the beginning of your game, you select your class and character. Classes have the following characteristics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMAGE: Mages have the lowest defense, but high SP and the ability to use a variety of skills. Mage strategy involves finding and equipping powerful spells, and using foes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' weaknesses and immunities to their advantage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nROGUE: Rogues have moderate defense and deal moderate damage. Due to their speed, rogues will always go first in combat. Rogues can only equip bows, so they generally want to find and equip stronger bows throughout the game. Rogues have access to moderate SP, so they can make up for the lesser damage they do (compared to Warriors) by a slightly greater use of skills.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWARRIOR: Warriors have the highest defense and deal the most damage. They can equip swords. Warriors have the lowest SP, so they rely the least on the use of skills. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe final step before gameplay is selecting your character\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gender. The player character in this game is less a player-defined avatar and more a character in their own right. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSelecting Male will allow you to play as ALDER, and Female will allow you to play as ASPEN. They are essentially canon alternate-universe versions of each other, and so which you choose has relatively little bearing on the overall plot; it will, however, change how certain NPCs interact with you to some degree. These differences will be noted throughout this walkthrough. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---I. Lornely Forest---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe story begins with ALDER/ASPEN traveling past Lannerspeak with ill timing, right before the murder of Lord Lanner. No matter which options you select here, you will be accused of the murder and chased into the forest on foot by the guards. Here is where the story essentially opens up. You begin by the dead tree you evaded the guards in. From here, heading to the scratching leads to a dead end. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHeading to the burbling will take you to the stream, while the smell of smoke will take you to Marlowe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s campfire. You can travel in any order, so the order I describe is not the only way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-If you head to the campfire, you will be immediately confronted by Marlowe. Either responding or silently complying will put him a little more at ease, while continuing to hide will lead him to give you one more chance to come forward into the light, after which he will instantly kill you and you will be returned to the save point. When he asks what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing, \"I could ask you the same\" will peacably end the confrontation but will slightly reduce his favor of you, while \"Running from a crime I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t commit\" will end will simply end the confrontation. Regardless of which you choose, you are free leave or return to the campsite at will after this. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSleeping by the fire will fully restore your HP and MP/SP. You can return to heal at it as many times as you need to. At the campsite, you also have the option to recruit Marlowe as your companion. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 If you want to try for the complete bestiary, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want Marlowe as your companion for later on. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-If you head to the stream: there is a chance that on the way there, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be attacked by a Spideer. These are the weakest enemies in the game and should give you no trouble, but you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have the chance to figure out combat for the first time. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCrossing the stream will take you in the direction of the cave, which is optional, while following the stream will take you in the direction of continuing the story. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the stream, you can select \"Something gleams by the water\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s edge\" to find the leatherbound journal, which contains the clues needed to get through the forest thicket across the stream. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-If you cross the stream: you will encounter the forest thicket. At each clearing, the trail splits into four options, each beside a tree with a symbol carved into it. Selecting the wrong trail at any point will magically return you to the start of the thicket. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe clues to the answer come from the historical excerpt in the journal; the correct answer of the trees essentially follows the key figures in the order they are mentioned. In the first clearing, the Snake represents Taline Kasabian; in the second, the dragon represents SERVAAS, and in the third and final clearing, the falcon represents the Lanners. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you emerge from the clearing, there is a good chance you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be attacked by a Restless Ghost. The Restless Ghost is relatively weak, but also has a fire weakness. Outside of the cave, clicking the \"There is something small and half-buried beside you\" will get you a hidden Potion, which can be used at any time from your INVENTORY to restore health. There are relatively few Potions in the game, however, so bear that in mind for your decision to use it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInside the cave, you can take the left or right fork. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 The right fork is a dead-end, but there is a 1 in 4 chance you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll encounter a Northern Venomcat; this is the only place in the game a Northern Venomcat can be found, so go in and kill it if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going for 100% completion of the BESTIARY; it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll also earn you a valuable Venomcat Pelt to sell later. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaking the left fork takes you deeper into the cave; there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a small chance you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll encounter a Spideer here. From here, going into the cavern will take you into the confrontation with Alcuin. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 If Marlowe is with you, he will warn you that you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t take Alcuin in a fair fight. This is meant to be a hint. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChoosing to fight will take you into a battle that is literally impossible to win, even with Marlow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s assistance. Choosing to flee will also get you killed if you are a mage or warrior. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nR Rogues can actually outrun Alcuin if you flee; you will be returned to the cave corridor outside of the cavern. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo defeat him, select \"the nearest pillar, cracked from years of decay\", and when Alcuin charges, you will trick him into smashing into it and collapsing it onto himself. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPressing forward will take you into the Lich Battlemaster\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lair. Note that once you enter the deepest room and begin speaking with the Lich Battlemaster, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have the option to end the conversation by leaving, however, as the game notes, you will be unable to return to that room to speak with her again. The conversation will end similarly no matter what, though answering with the more insulting \"Oh, come on...\" response will cause you to lose some favor with her. At the end, she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll force you to decide between killing her and taking her as your companion. Killing her will grant you no XP, but you will get her sword, the Dracobane, which can be wielded if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a Warrior or sold at a decent price later. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going for a complete bestiary, killing her here is the only way to get the Lich Battlemaster entry. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you either take her with you or kill her, you return to the cavernous room from before. Be sure to click on \"The dead demon Alcuin\" to get Alcuin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Horn, which you can later sell. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 While examining Alcuin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s corpse, Marlowe will comment that he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s glad he came with you. If you are playing as the male character Alder, he will attempt to flirt with you, and you have the option of flirting back; doing so will raise both his romantic relationship count and his favor of you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter this, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nothing left to do here but return to the stream. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Following the stream will take you outside of the traveler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s camp. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-From here, selecting \"A cluster of reeds...\" in the second paragraph will take you to a hidden area, Camber\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s shop. If you bring him four Poison Antler Shards (obtained by killing Spideer), he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll give you a useful weapon tailed to your class, each fairly powerful: Mages get the Phantom Spideer spell, rogues get the Spideer Hornbow, and Warriors get the sword Venompoint. Additionally, Camber will give you Vegetable Stew, which functionally serves as a Potion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBack outside, you can move forward, which will take you to the edge of the camp. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 There is a 1 in 4 chance here that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll encounter a Mud Lurker; as this is the only place where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re guaranteed to encounter one, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth re-entering until you fight it if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going for full completion. The Mud Lurker is tougher than other enemies you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve encountered so far, so be cautious; it has a Poison weakness that can be exploited if you got the poison weapon/spell from Camber. When defeated, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get either Mud Lurker Scales or a Mud Lurker Shell Fragment. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the edge of camp, you have the option to enter the camp--going right inside will get you an instant game over, as you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be recognized and captured. Instead, click on \"a large tree\" in the second paragraph, which will cause you to hide behind the tree, listening to the nearby caravan guard. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll overhear his frightened, superstitious mumblings; take advantage of them by selecting \"a large tree branch\" in the first paragraph: you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll use it prop up your cloak and scare the guard away. However, selecting \"the caravan nearest you\" will cause a game over, as the guard will spot you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x96 If the Lich Battlemaster is with you, you can alternatively simply ask her to go into the woods and spook the guard, which she will begrudgingly do. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s unguarded, you can sneak into the caravan. You can open all three chests at your leisure; the second has the Noble Clothes, which you should immediately equip from your Inventory, once you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve returned outside. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the clothes equipped, you can now enter the encampment--be sure to equip them first, as entering otherwise will still grant you a game over. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be greeted by the pair of friends, Lord Montoire and Lady Aldana. You have to play the conversation right, or else you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll make them suspicious and cause them to arrest you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the first part, answer Juniper rather than your character\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s real name. In the second, either response will work; cracking the joke will cause them to laugh, and if you are playing as the female character Aspen, Lady Aldana will flirt with you. If you selected the response about \"Redcorrian ale\", you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be asked another question; choose the answer that mentions Tripel. After that, the conversation will be over, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re free to travel in/out of and around the camp. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the camp, selecting the cat (in the second paragraph) will take you to his shop, where you can sell and buy items; it is recommended that you sell whatever loot you have acquired here and use the money to upgrade your weapon or spells. Returning to the camp, you can speak to the guards, the cook, or the serving boy; all will be dead ends except for the cook, which will lead you to meet Daechiron. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter speaking to Daechiron, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have the option of taking him on as your companion; if you turn him down, you will not encounter him again. Whatever you choose, you can then start your journey to Eastern Hold, or stay here and keep preparing. If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been to the shop yet and planned to or wanted to grind for XP and loot more first, or had anything else you wanted to do in this section, do those first, as you cannot return to this area after embarking to the next part of the game. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll probably want a potion or two for the next segment of the game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---II. Eastern Hold---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy this point, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have encountered all of the potential companions/taken one of them if you chose to. You can speak to them if you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already to learn more about their backstories. You can have a deeper conversation with each three times, unless your approval is low, in which case they will refuse to speak with you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x86 Eventually, with Daechiron, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll learn of his curse. This will start the side-quest to cure him. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to have spoken with him before you reach Eastridge. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 Similarly, if Marlowe reveals his past to you, you can later perform the side-quest to cure him. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to have spoken with him about this before you embark down the Eastern Road very far. Additionally, if your character is male, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have another opportunity to flirt with Marlowe again to increase his romance score. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll begin the chapter on the Eastern Road, heading ultimately to Eastridge. You have the choice of sticking to the Main Road, which has three sections and somewhat easier foes, and an optional boss at the end, or the Hunter Trail, which has three sections of somewhat more difficult foes, with the boss at the end being non-optional. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x96\\\\xb3 If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re after full completion, both paths have the same percentage of chance to encounter the new enemies Hivernal Owl, Highwayman, and Doppelganger, but you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to be sure to fight the Highwayman Leader boss, as he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a unique enemy you can only encounter here, and additionally, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll yield the item Westbay Mead. The Westbay Mead can be sold for a very high price or consumed for a unique scene. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 If you have spoken to Marlowe about his curse and want to cure him, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to take the Hunter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Trail. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis part may be tough, so don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t feel bad about needing to use a Potion at some point. The foes here can take a hit, so take advantage of your campanions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' strength by letting them weaken the enemy a bit before finishing them off for the XP. If you took the main road, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have the option of fighting the Highwayman Leader or sneaking past him; if you took the hunter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s trail, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to fight him. After defeating him or avoiding him, you can enter Tonnelle d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Ames. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve unlocked Marlowe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sidequest and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s with you, at this point you can follow him into the woods to a cabin. Inside, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll fight the demon Astoriel, and get his phylactery in your inventory upon his defeat. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need this later. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-In Tonnelle d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Ames, you can pet the dog, which gives your character nothing but the joy of petting a dog, approach the Satyr, who runs a shop, or enter the inn. As always, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s recommended that you sell unneeded loot and upgrade your weapons at the shop before moving on (you can also buy the Gossipy Pamphlet, which just gives provides more lore about the story). In the inn, you can speak to the harpies inside or pay 10 silver to rest and recover your health and MP/SP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-When you leave Tonnelle d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Ames, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get on the road again, this time to Eastridge. Here, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only one path, with four sections; you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll fight an enemy on each before reaching Eastridge, and the last is a miniboss, Great Bear. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce in Eastridge, you can check out the library, the Cantrelle Estate, or the Lightkeeper Fort. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nM If you enter the library and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re playing as a mage, you can explore the first floor for the very powerful spell Holy Griffon. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x86 If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve unlocked Daechiron\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s quest, you can enter the library and follow his guidance, where he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll lead you to a book that he will read. This is the necessary first step in the side-quest.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-If you try to approach the LightKeeper fort, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll only be turned away, so you can go to the Cantrelle Estate. Here, you can talk to a young stableboy for information, but you want him to keep his guard down so he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t alert the Cantrelles\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' guards. You generally want to avoid asking questions too directly here. Choosing the wrong option will lead to a game over. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the first part, ask him what he does. Then, select \"I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m in the market for a good messenger...\" and after that say you need the \"fastest, best messengers\". The stablekid will tell you about the secret entrance at the Lightkeeper Fort that he delivers messages to, and you can now return to the fort. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Note: only return to the Lightkeeper Fort at this point if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done everything you wanted to/bought what you needed from the shop, as the next sequence begins the end of this chapter, and you will be unable to return. Once you return to the Lightkeeper fort, you can follow the narrow passageway in back and sneak into the window. Inside, you can examine the plaque, spear, and plant if you want to, but do so first, as examining the desk papers will trigger the next part of the game, and Erimund will immediately return and chase you from the building. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to fight Erimund at the end; he has no weaknesses, but is immune to poison. After his defeat, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll Erimund\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Note in your inventory. Reading this note grants you the option of a secret dialogue choice that alters the first part of the final battle later. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you defeat Erimund, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll automatically move on to the next part of the game. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---III. Southern Hold---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the final chapter of the game, and is the shortest with regard to exploration. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou begin on the road through Southern hold, deep in the Eternal Gloaming. There are new enemies to fight here, and the road has four sections, each with a fight, but no miniboss at the end. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll emerge in the Elven city. From here, you can go to the August Palace, which will initiate the endgame. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore that, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll probably want to select the cat, who runs a shop. As before, you can sell loot and upgrade your weapons or spells, which is highly recommended before the final boss; her items are the most expensive in the game, but powerful. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x86 If Daechiron is with you, if his sidequest has been unlocked, AND if you completed the first part in the libarary, purchasing Cironor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Book from the cat will complete your portion of his sidequest.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re prepared, you can approach the August Palace, where your companion will comment that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all about to end. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 If Marlowe is your companion, this is the third and final opportunity to flirt with him. If you have done so all three times, his romance score will be at maximum for the final events. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Inside the palace, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find the big party. You can examine the skeletal dragon in the room, talk to the serving elf, talk to the blonde woman nearby, or examine the ossifrage--be advised that doing this last will engage the endgame. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Examining the ossifrage will cause Lady Cantrelle to take note of you; either option will cause the party to fall silent. From here, if you read Erimund\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Note, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have a special option that will cause Lizbeth to give up, and the ossifrage will kill her. If you choose this option, the ensuing fight will be a little easier, as it will be against the ossifrage alone. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n If you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have that option or choose the other, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll fight the ossifrage with Lizbeth helping it. The difference is only slight; if Lizbeth is aiding it, they will have the additional move \"Lizbeth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s knife\", which does the most damage of all its attacks. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n After defeating the ossifrage, it will reveal its true form as the demon Nerva, and will possess the dragon skeleton for the true final boss fight. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n In both ossifrage and skeletal dragon form, Nerva has no weaknesses, but he also has no immunities, so all of your strongest attacks are fair game, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll definitely want your companion\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s aid every turn. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Once you defeat him, as Nerva dies, he will make his final act an attempt to crush you with the dragon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s skull. This will end one of several ways. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x86 If you completed all parts of Daechiron\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sidequest, he will revert to his true form and effortlessly stop the skull with magic. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x98\\\\x96 If your companion is the Lich Battlemaster, she will jump in front of you to try to stop the skull, and will be crushed in the process. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\xe2\\\\x99\\\\x88 If Marlowe is your companion:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -If your romance count with Marlowe is at its maximum, he will deflect the skull and survive. If you have Astoriel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s phylactery, he will then break it and end his curse. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -Otherwise, he will be mortally wounded by the skull after taking the hit for you, and he will die there. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n -If your romance count is not at maximum and you have completed his sidequest, his dying request will be for you to break Astoriel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s phylactery, and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll die with the curse lifted. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n If you have no companion, you will be partly crushed by the skull, and will pass out on the floor. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll wake in a bed, with the elven king and your father present. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Otherwise, your father will approach you at the party. Your decision with regard to him marks your last decision in the game. After this, the story will conclude. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ---V. Bestiary/Enemy Guide---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow is an in-depth guide to the enemies that can be encountered in-game. The blurb, weakness, and immunity can be also found in the in-game bestiary once defeated, along with the number you have killed. In the \"known moves\" section, the damage power of each move is listed by its name in parentheses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Spideer \\\\\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\\\\\nHP: 10\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Venomed Antler (5), Stomp (3)\\\\\\\\nloot: Poison Antler Shard\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Lornely Forest and Eastern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: Eight legs, two antlers, no mercy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Restless Ghost\\\\\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\\\\\nHP: 15\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Rending Shriek (5), Dark Pulse (3), Shade\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Wrath (3)\\\\\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Forest\\\\\\\\nblurb: They wander empty forests, not knowing or remembering what they are, driven by unending pain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Northern Venomcat\\\\\\\\nweakness: spirit\\\\\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\\\\\nHP: 12\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Poison Fang (5), Crush of Fangs (3), Claw-tipped Swipe (3)\\\\\\\\nloot: Venomcat Pelt\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Cave\\\\\\\\nblurb: A predator of light build and dark blue, spotted fur. Its incisors carry venom, as the name suggests. Its closest relative, the Southdales Venomcat, was prized for its fur and hunted to extinction...but in the wilds of the Northern Hold, the venomcat roams free...and feared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Mud Lurker\\\\\\\\nweakness: poison\\\\\\\\nimmunity: fire\\\\\\\\nHP: 20\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Bite (7), Full-body Slam (10), Tail Strike (6)\\\\\\\\nloot: Mud Lurker Shell Fragment, Mud Lurker Scales\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Lornley Forest and Eastern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: A large reptile native to freshwater streams; an extant ancestor to turtles, which serve as its meals as often as riverfish. To see what makes it markedly more dangerous than a turtle, one need only look at its more saurian head, lined with needle-sharp teeth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Doppelg\\\\xc3\\\\xa4nger\\\\\\\\nweakness: ice\\\\\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\\\\\nHP: 25\\\\\\\\nknown moves: {incomprehensible attack} (10), {incomprehensible attack} (7), {incomprehensible attack} (6)\\\\\\\\nloot: Rusted Relic\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold and Southern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: Whatever these things truly are, they appear in dark places, such as moonless forests or unlit corners of buildings. Its physical appearance is exactly that of the person who encounters it, except with a permanent, placid smile, and they never utter a sound. When killed, they disappear, strangely leaving behind old battle relics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Hivernal Owl\\\\\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\\\\\nimmunity: ice\\\\\\\\nHP: 25\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Icewind (9), Talon Rake (5), Freezing Bite (6)\\\\\\\\nloot: White Feather\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: A large breed of owl native to the rainy fields and forests of the Tonnelle d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\xc3\\\\xa2mes, and sometimes encountered in surrounding areas. As much a natural predator as any owl, the Hivernal has evolved to use a primitive form of ice magic to slow or freeze its prey. It is the subject of much old poetry throughout Eastern Hold. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Highwayman\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 25\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Rally (12), Swift Strike (6), Reckless Blow (8)\\\\\\\\nloot: Silver Charm\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Eastern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: An Eastern Hold bandit prone to ambushing vulnerable travelers on dark roads. While the Southern Hold bandits tend to represent organized crime and are made of xenophobic humans, in Eastern Hold, a bandit gang is typically a small group of humans and satyrs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Highwayman Leader\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 35\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Brutal Swing (10), Swift Strike (7), Reckless Strike (7)\\\\\\\\nloot: Westbay Mead\\\\\\\\nencounter: fixed, Eastern Hold main road\\\\\\\\nblurb: A highwayman...but, like, the leader.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Sundog\\\\\\\\nweakness: electric\\\\\\\\nimmunity: fire\\\\\\\\nHP: 35\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Flamejet (12), Burning Bite (8), Claw Swipe (6)\\\\\\\\nloot: Sundog Tooth\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: A wild canine of striking orange coat, white chest, and black legs. Its firebreathing was long a mystery to mages, as it gives off no magical aura: elven researchers recently discovered the sundog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ability comes from gas released from a special organ, ignited in the sundog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s maw by a click of specialized flint-like back teeth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Renegade Bloodmage\\\\\\\\nweakness: ice\\\\\\\\nimmunity: spirit\\\\\\\\nHP: 35\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Mindbend (12), Summon Lesser Demon (9), Spirit Bolt (9)\\\\\\\\nloot: Bloodmage Phylactery\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: While some forms of magic are outlawed universally in all four holds of Eritan, laws will always have breakers. With these eldritch sadists around, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s easy to see why a fear of mages is not uncommon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Demon Astoriel\\\\\\\\nweakness: electric\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 40\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Arcane Terror (10), Forbidden Fire Rune (7), Arcstorm (7)\\\\\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\\\\\nencounter: fixed, Marlowe quest\\\\\\\\nblurb: A relatively minor demon, and one particularly fond of wandering amid mortals, disguised as one of them. While other demons tend to remain a bit more aloof, Astoriel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fascination with mortal drives led him to interact with them often, to better observe their behavior...and make things more insteresting as he saw fit. This tendency came back to bite him, as you killed him to free Marlowe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s soul.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Great Bear\\\\\\\\nweakness: fire\\\\\\\\nimmunity: ice\\\\\\\\nHP: 30\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Maul (12), Bellowing Charge (7), Massive Swipe (7)\\\\\\\\nloot: N/A\\\\\\\\nencounter: fixed, east road just before Eastridge-by-the-Sea\\\\\\\\nblurb: A very large and very territorial bear, with an immensely thick brown coat that helps to cushion it from blows. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Balaur\\\\\\\\nweakness: spirit\\\\\\\\nimmunity: electric\\\\\\\\nHP: 35 \\\\\\\\nknown moves: Electric Slam (10), Swift Fang (10), Winged Dive (10)\\\\\\\\nloot: Balaur Heart\\\\\\\\nencounter: random, Southern Hold\\\\\\\\nblurb: A horse-sized flying reptile. As the only extant relative of the feared and revered dragon, it shares dragons\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' affinity for magic (preferring electricity to the dragon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fire). Though they lack dragons\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' sentience, they have been shown to have some primitive intellect of their own and the beginnings of what could be considered culture. Curiously, they are social beings, unlike dragons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNOTE: the following don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have Bestiary entries, but are fought nonetheless. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Knight-Paladin Erimund\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: poison\\\\\\\\nHP: 50\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Shining Arrow (10), Holy Fire (7), Blinding Volley (7)\\\\\\\\nloot: Erimund\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Note\\\\\\\\nencounter: fixed, Eastern Hold boss\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-Demon Nerva\\\\\\\\nOssifrage form, with Lizbeth:\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 55\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Lizbeth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Knife (12), Crushing Beak (5), Bonebreaking Wings (5)\\\\\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOssifrage form, without Lizbeth:\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 50\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Razer Talons (5), Crushing Beak (7), Bonebreaking Wings (7)\\\\\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\xc3\\\\x81SVALDR form:\\\\\\\\nweakness: none\\\\\\\\nimmunity: none\\\\\\\\nHP: 75\\\\\\\\nknown moves: Fireball (15), Lashing Tail (9), Crushing Jaws (9)\\\\\\\\nencounter: final boss\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNOTE: (If encountered) Demon Alcuin and (if killed) Lich Battlemaster have Bestiary entries, but as they are not actually fought, they are not listed here. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---vi.

Go N, then enter the hut and take some straw. Examine the trash\\\\\\\\ncan and take the candle. Well, you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really need it. Exit the hut\\\\\\\\nthen go E.\\\\\\\\n Take a piece of steel from the dory, then go E again and take a vine.\\\\\\\\nGo W, W, S, and drop all but the vine. Go E, and you should be at the\\\\\\\\nedge of a cliff. Tie the vine to a rock then go Down. Enter the cave and\\\\\\\\nexamine and search all, then take a rock from the ground. Dig in ground.\\\\\\\\nTake the map, then E, Up, W. Look at the map, then N.\\\\\\\\n At this point, you might want to save the game. Go N, N, E, N, E, E, S,\\\\\\\\nS, E. Search the trunk and take the bottle, but don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t drink it. Go W, W,\\\\\\\\nN, W, W, S, W, S, S, S. Drop the map, then take the piece of steel and\\\\\\\\nthe shell. Listen to the shell.

Go S, W, then take the hat and look inside the hat.\\\\\\\\nRather then leave a tip, you can kiss the woman. Go W, N, E, then type,\\\\\\\\n\"CHANDRALT\" or whatever the password is in your game.

It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Rosalind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s birthday, but her\\\\\\\\nmother is distraught and either hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t remembered or isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t paying\\\\\\\\nattention to her. So, Rosalind decides to visit her grandmother who\\\\\\\\nlives in the forest. To prepare for the journey, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need all of\\\\\\\\ngrandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s supplies (everything that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s on the table: the wine, the\\\\\\\\nbread, and the jar of honey), plus our red cape:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take everything from the table\\\\\\\\n> open the chest\\\\\\\\n> take the cape\\\\\\\\n> wear the cape\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore we go, though, some insight to the story can be gained from\\\\\\\\ntrying to talk to Rosalind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mother:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s out the door and on to grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s house:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> out\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> southwest\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpon entering the woods, we meet a wolf (press any key to advance\\\\\\\\nthrough the cut scene). He leads us somewhat astray, but Rosalind is\\\\\\\\nbecoming a resourceful young woman, and we soon finds our way back to\\\\\\\\nthe path:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\\\\\n> (any compass direction)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis puts us at the covered bridge and the edge of the Black Forest. Now\\\\\\\\nthat we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve reached the forest, many options are possible. For the\\\\\\\\npursposes of this walkthrough, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll go first to grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s house (to\\\\\\\\nretreive her locket). It isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t far:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n> northwest\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSomething seems amiss here in grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s living room, and having a\\\\\\\\ngood look around may be in order. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re after the locket, which is up in\\\\\\\\nthe attic crawlspace, which we can access via the kitchen:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> west\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore going up the the attic, note the cellar door:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the cellar door\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(More on that later.) In the meantime, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s proceed to the attic:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> up\\\\\\\\n> examine the glint\\\\\\\\n> take the locket\\\\\\\\n> wear the locket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that we have grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s locket, other important parts of the game\\\\\\\\nwill become available. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one challenge though:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the locket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe locket won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t cooperate with this, at least not yet. A hint about\\\\\\\\nthis can be found by stepping out into the woods and trying again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> down\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> open the locket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo open the locket, we need to get out from under the canopy of the\\\\\\\\nforest (and into the center of the lake):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo properly get out from under the canopy, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to get into the\\\\\\\\ncenter of the lake, by boat:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> pull the chain\\\\\\\\n> enter the boat\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnder the unfiltered moonlight, we can:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the locket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis action activates the magical powers of the locket, prompting a\\\\\\\\nvariety of visions and remembrances throughout the rest of the game. To\\\\\\\\nget back in to shore, we:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> pull the chain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere were some parts of grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s house left unexplored, so let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nreturn there (to collect the walking stick and the monocle, among other\\\\\\\\nthings). On the way we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll make a detour so that we can have some light\\\\\\\\nin the basement. To make all this possible, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to re-purpose the\\\\\\\\njar of honey.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the jar\\\\\\\\n> wash the jar\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll make ourselves a lantern:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> west\\\\\\\\n> catch some fireflies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow back to grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s house for some snooping around her side yard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> west\\\\\\\\n> north (*this action will trigger a vision)\\\\\\\\n> west\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the side yard, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s woodpile and the hatchet she\\\\\\\\nuses to trim her firewood.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take the hatchet\\\\\\\\n> examine the woodpile\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSomeone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been digging through the woodpile. Perhaps you should as well:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> search the woodpile\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou find an unusual log, which bears a closer look:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> examine the log (* this action will trigger a vision)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe other major attraction in the side yard is the old well:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> examine the well\\\\\\\\n> examine the bucket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRecall that the cellar door was locked. This is out alternative route\\\\\\\\nunderground, where we find some important items, and return to the\\\\\\\\nkitchen:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> enter the bucket\\\\\\\\n> take the key\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n> take the glass fragment\\\\\\\\n> examine it (*)\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n> east [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNLOCKING]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s return to the living room (to collect the gloves and the\\\\\\\\npebbles):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n> examine the quilt\\\\\\\\n> take it\\\\\\\\n> look\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDisturbing the quilt uncovers the gloves, which will come in handy later\\\\\\\\n(the quilt itself is unnecessary).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> drop the quilt\\\\\\\\n> take the gloves\\\\\\\\n> examine them\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe other important item here is the grandfather clock:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> examine the clock\\\\\\\\n> open it\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo open the clock, recall a specific detail from the vision:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> concentrate on the locket (*)\\\\\\\\n> set the time to 2:35\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInside the clock, we find a boy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hunting jacket.

They form a path which we can follow\\\\\\\\n(to visit the burned ground and collect the candies):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> southeast (*)\\\\\\\\n> east\\\\\\\\n> northeast\\\\\\\\n> northwest\\\\\\\\n> northeast (*)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis creepy patch of burned ground has past significance (which is\\\\\\\\nrevealed explicitly if the old woman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s monocle has already been\\\\\\\\ndiscovered):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> look\\\\\\\\n> concentrate on the monocle (*)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the old woman wore the monocle, she moved as though was was\\\\\\\\navoiding \"invisible obstacles\". Wearing the monocle will grant us a\\\\\\\\nsimilar ability:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wear the monocle\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUh-oh. The orange candies inside the cage are mesmerizing. If we try a\\\\\\\\ncouple of different things while we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re transfixed, a few hints will be\\\\\\\\nrevealed about how to free us from the candy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s spell:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> blink\\\\\\\\n> eat the bread\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s try that again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wear monocle\\\\\\\\n> examine the cage\\\\\\\\n> take the candies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reach the candies, at least not with our arms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> push the candies with the walking stick\\\\\\\\n> take candies\\\\\\\\n> examine them (*)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe pieces are coming together, but there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one area that we haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nexplored completely yet. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll go there to collect the dagger, crush the\\\\\\\\ncandies, and learn the details of the curse (which will kick off the\\\\\\\\nendgame):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> remove the monocle\\\\\\\\n> southwest\\\\\\\\n> west\\\\\\\\n> north (*)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe cave entrance is blocked:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut the vision we saw upon arriving indicates that the walking stick\\\\\\\\nwill be helpful:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> swing the walking stick\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n> down\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are several things of note in the cavern. First the inscriptions,\\\\\\\\nwhich are un-readable without the aid of the monocle:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> examine the inscriptions\\\\\\\\n> wear the monocle\\\\\\\\n> examine the inscriptions\\\\\\\\n> remove the monocle\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we have taken the candies and read the inscriptions, things can\\\\\\\\nprogress rapidly towards the endgame. A few final visions will \"barge\\\\\\\\nin\" during the next few rounds. The first of these visions gives a hint\\\\\\\\nabout where to go next (the waterfall).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut first: note that the inscriptions mention a bit about \"sweet\\\\\\\\ntemptation\" and show an image of snow or powder sprinking down onto a\\\\\\\\nskull. To make some sweet powder, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll use the mortar and pestle here:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take the pestle\\\\\\\\n> put the candies into the mortar\\\\\\\\n> crush them with the pestle\\\\\\\\n> take the powder\\\\\\\\n> put the pestle into the mortar\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note the tin box:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the box\\\\\\\\n> take the dagger\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOuch! The silver allergy was also mentioned in the inscriptions, but\\\\\\\\ndon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worry. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re prepared:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wear the gloves\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough you might have to do some inventory management, depending on\\\\\\\\nwhat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in your hands at the time (the walking stick, for example, is\\\\\\\\ndirty and would ruin grandmother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gloves). Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wearing the\\\\\\\\ngloves, you can:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take the dagger\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s off the the waterfall (and the endgame):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> up\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> southwest\\\\\\\\n> southwest\\\\\\\\n> down (*)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you had visited the bottom of the waterfall before, it was a dead\\\\\\\\nend. However, by this point you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re more attuned to your surroundings.\\\\\\\\nNote: from here, there will be no turning back -- this would be a good\\\\\\\\ntime to save the game!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> north\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two graves in this clearing (one for Rosalind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s uncle Hansel\\\\\\\\nand one for her brother Rainer), along with the wolf (her father) with\\\\\\\\ngrandmother (who was swallowed whole) in his belly. According the the\\\\\\\\ninscriptions, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in search of the bones of the first cursed person in\\\\\\\\nthe family to die. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s uncle Hansel, and to access his bones:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> open the wooden grave\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom here, there are eight final outcomes possible. The endings have\\\\\\\\nvarying levels of \"success\" depending on whether you and your family\\\\\\\\nmembers survive the next few rounds and whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re able to lift the\\\\\\\\ncurse. There are several actions that can be undertaken in a variety of\\\\\\\\ncombinations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Attacking the wolf with the hatchet will free grandmother from the\\\\\\\\nwolf\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s belly without killing him.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Attacking the wolf with the silver dagger will kill him (and\\\\\\\\ngrandmother, too, if she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still trapped in his belly).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Sprinkling the powder onto Uncle Hansel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bones will lift the curse\\\\\\\\nand turn the wolf back into your father. (This action will kill\\\\\\\\ngrandmother if she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in the wolf\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s belly at the time.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Going south will be considered an attempt to run away. (You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be\\\\\\\\ngiven two opportunities to reconsider because this choice will always\\\\\\\\nend badly.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the eight combinations that will end the game:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #1 ---\\\\\\\\nThis is the best possible ending, in which Rosalind, grandmother, and\\\\\\\\nfather all survive and are free from the curse.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #2 ---\\\\\\\\nRosalind and grandmother survive and are free from the curse, but the\\\\\\\\nwolf (your father) dies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\\\\\n> attack the wolf with the silver dagger\\\\\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #3 ---\\\\\\\\nRosalind and father survive and are free from the curse, but grandmother\\\\\\\\ndies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #4 ---\\\\\\\\nRosalind survives and is free from the curse, but father and grandmother\\\\\\\\nboth die:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> attack wolf with the silver dagger\\\\\\\\n> sprinkle the powder onto the bones\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #5 ---\\\\\\\\nRosalind and grandmother survive but remain cursed. The wolf (your\\\\\\\\nfather) dies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> attack the wolf with the hatchet\\\\\\\\n> attack the wolf with the silver dagger\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n> south\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n--- Ending #6 ---\\\\\\\\nRosalind survives but remains cursed.

Secondary objects are killing off a warrior, werewolf, vampire and wolf... as well as sleeping with a sexy blonde maid for added measure of \"conquest\". (j/k) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are a few major bugs with Bob Sorem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s port... the murder weapon is not always what is described in the text of the game.  For example, on Mystery #1 - in-game the murder weapon was said to be the \"AXE\", but I had to bring the CLUB to the murder scene.   In the James Garnett ver 19.4, that is all fixed... but in his port I could not save the game at all - it didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t restore correctly even with SUSPEND/LOAD commands.  So I definitely preferred the SOREM version for playing with its nice save system... but you MUST be aware of that bug.  Solving the case really is as simple as walking into the correct location with both the murderer and the murder weapon.  (and then you can walk to the phone to \"Call Police\")\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nALSO... Magic works differently in the SOREM port then it does in the Garnett version.

Having done that and previously survived all hazards, confronted the murderer and turned him/her over to the police and still had time to take a shower and a restful sleep on the maids bed (I have been able to get all the available treasure quickly enough to need to sleep for a couple of hours before the game ends), you should score well over 900 points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\\\\\\\nSCORE RANKINGS & POINTS:\\\\\\\\nPITIFUL Sleuth (0-85)\\\\\\\\nPOOR Sleuth  (85-170)\\\\\\\\nUNLUCKY (171-254)\\\\\\\\nNOVICE  (255-340)\\\\\\\\nFAIR   (341-425)\\\\\\\\nAMATEUR (426-510)\\\\\\\\nGOOD  (511-595)\\\\\\\\nLUCKY (596-680)\\\\\\\\nSKILLFUL (681-765)\\\\\\\\nSUPERB (766-850)\\\\\\\\nMASTER (851-930)\\\\\\\\nSUPER (931+ )\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n===============================================\\\\\\\\nEXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH WITH POINT TOTALS:\\\\\\\\n===============================================\\\\\\\\nRemember:  \"score points\" (+2 -

I would agree that it was quite ambitious for its time, and also a pretty steep challenge.  Not only is the battery in the lamp greatly underpowered, but you have also have the ticking time bomb of the daylight hours, and the eventual end game to deal with.  I never made it to the end of the game with any light intact, other than a last ditch match to light my last candle to escape the cluthes of the burning down Mansion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few brief comments about ports...  even with the SUSPEND feature, I could not actually save a game properly on the James Garnett port.  Not sure if its just new versions of windows vs. old versions or what... but everytime I tried to restore I ended up back at the Main Gate without being able to move anywhere.  So I had to play Sorem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s port instead, which has a terrific save game feature with save slots.  One thing to watch out for (if anybody is reading this blog in search of tips like I was)...   MAGIC works quite differently in the two ports.  Sorem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s port you can divine all four magic words in the garden, while Garnett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s port seems to have two \"fixed\" words (they are the same everytime).  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne other possible major bug in the Sorem port is that sometimes the in-game description tells you the wrong murder weapon!  I was trying everything to accuse the Butler with the Axe (the game said so)... but I looked up the same mystery on the Garnett port and the murder weapon was the CLUB.  When I brought the club to the crime scene... the game proudly announced I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d solved the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few things I discovered in addition to the tips listed here that might help:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Gold Coins = I too never discovered them, but the source code alludes to digging?  If anybody wants to dig all over the game world, let me know what you find.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The Maid = Yes, she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s particular.  There are actually FIVE criteria that have to be met, and solving the crime isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t one of them.   This happens in the Maid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Room:\\\\\\\\n1. There are no other people around (just you and her)\\\\\\\\n2. The door is closed & locked\\\\\\\\n3. There is no light in the room\\\\\\\\n4. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re freshly showered.\\\\\\\\n5. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re carrying nothing!  (so don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget to \"Drop Clothes\" too...  that sounded funny)\\\\\\\\n  and one caveat about your timing in this, *ahem, endeavour...  if you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t OPEN CURTAIN and have light come in... you have no way to escape the room.  You are locked in, can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t pickup anything in the dark, and can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t turn on any lights!!   The seductress has ensnared you in her devious trap!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The Taxi = is actually not available after you solve the crime.  Solving the crime does allow you to call the police, but calling for a Taxi seems to occur only late in the game.  Certainly after the explosion, but probably sometime after a particular time on the clock it would work as well.  (Maybe 10 or 11?)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFascinating game overall.  Truly challenging... even trying to optimize the walkthrough to allow for points had me checking score at almost every step to figure out where the points were scored, and trying desperately to do as much as possible without that lantern on.  Dude, next time bring some duracells!  I eventually scored 979 pts, so I think 999 is maybe... possibly...  possible.  But you can only carry so much over the finish line.  In any case, I wrote up a solution/FAQ guide which I hope to posted over at the interactive fiction archives soon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThanks for your postings and the introduction to this game.  I had no knowledge of this growing up, jumped more into the likes of Zork & Adventureland.  \\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\"Walkthrough for Necrotic Drift\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, we\\\\\\'re in New Haz again, on a different outing. How different? It\\\\\\'s a\\\\\\\\nbit like comparing The World\\\\\\'s End to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in\\\\\\\\nthe Blood and Ice-cream Trilogy: Necrotic Drift\\\\\\'s setting and focus are\\\\\\\\nmore linear and narrow than Fallacy of Dawn, but with a darker, more\\\\\\\\nmature plot and characters. I may make another reference to these films\\\\\\\\nlater, but I\\\\\\'ll keep it to one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChapter One: Duffy\\\\\\\\nOur intro is to a nice guy named Duffy, his love of D&D and one of the\\\\\\\\nfew times he and his dad were best friends as well as family. Today\\\\\\\\nhowever, he\\\\\\'s rolling his Dodge stat against video rental fees by going\\\\\\\\nto Academy Videos in New Haz so he can have a movie night with his\\\\\\\\non/off girlfriend Audrey. Trying to prove a point about The Lord of the\\\\\\\\nRings can lead to danger, it seems.\\\\\\\\nYou don\\\\\\'t \\\\\\'need\\\\\\' to talk to Gibs or your room-mates in this number-based\\\\\\\\ndialogue system, but there\\\\\\'s a nice bit of flavor.\\\\\\\\nGibs is your best mate and chatting to him goes a little bit more into\\\\\\\\nyour problems with Audrey (any number), and why your room-mates should\\\\\\\\nnot be around if you want a movie night with her (if you picked 3).\\\\\\\\nTalking to him again after he mentions his plans for tonight offers some\\\\\\\\nforeshadowing.\\\\\\\\nTalking to both of your room-mates gives you an idea of why they\\\\\\\\nprobably shouldn\\\\\\'t be your room-mates.\\\\\\\\nX Clerk if you like- Adrian Bates hasn\\\\\\'t changed a bit, not even his\\\\\\\\nprofile photo. \\\\\\\\nX DVDs. You can also X the genres to get an idea of Duffy\\\\\\'s personal\\\\\\\\ntaste.\\\\\\\\nTake DVD- no need to specify as Duffy automatically takes The Lord of\\\\\\\\nthe Rings. \\\\\\\\nYou can also TAKE NAIL GUN when the clerk tells all of you to hurry up\\\\\\\\nfor sleazy reasons, as he places it on the counter. He doesn\\\\\\'t notice\\\\\\\\nyou nicking it, so it looks like he really wants that massage...\\\\\\\\nSoon enough it begins. Some creature lurks its way into the store. The\\\\\\\\nclerk thinks it\\\\\\'s a tramp and shows his caring attitude from the last\\\\\\\\ngame. Everyone else thinks it\\\\\\'s a bot, but bots other than Failed Romero\\\\\\\\nnormally don\\\\\\'t attack people- not even rude video store staff.\\\\\\\\nI normally ATTACK THING and save the clerk, but as long as you deal with\\\\\\\\nit before it starts on you. In fact, if you let it knock the clerk out,\\\\\\\\nGibs encourages you to go get the nail-gun- which you may not have\\\\\\\\nnoticed before because you weren\\\\\\'t reading closely enough (oops).\\\\\\\\nSo, no need to pay to hire LOtR. Let\\\\\\'s go home. E.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can X your car all you want, you can\\\\\\'t realise that the bot\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nclimbed into your car until you try to \\\\\\'enter car\\\\\\'. Cheeky bastard knows\\\\\\\\nto hide on the car floor.\\\\\\\\nAttack thing again until it drops.\\\\\\\\nEnter car.\\\\\\\\nDrive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChapter Two: Audrey\\\\\\\\nOnto your date with Audrey! In your living room, with two troublesome\\\\\\\\nhousemates...This is definitely the part that reminded me a little of\\\\\\\\nShaun of the Dead, so this is a problem that many people are having\\\\\\\\ntoday, especially since many people can\\\\\\'t move out. This chapter is\\\\\\\\nfairly dialogue-driven, and your choices matter more in the banter you\\\\\\\\nread next. You can skip to the next chapter in this walkthrough if you\\\\\\\\nlike.\\\\\\\\nThe Duffster shares the story of his one big win that lead to his car, a\\\\\\\\nless limited wardrobe and his relationship: a D&D tournament that was\\\\\\\\nwon through being a skilled and kind player...five years ago.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nT Pang. Unfortunately, no matter which number you pick he won\\\\\\'t bugger\\\\\\\\noff. When you hear the knock on the door, OPEN DOOR to let Audrey in.\\\\\\\\nYou can talk to your housemates as they argue over what DVD they\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\nwatching, but you can\\\\\\'t change how they behave.\\\\\\\\nYou can give your housemates a serve for ruining your date and being\\\\\\\\nrude to your girlfriend. T Pang, T Criswell in that order if you want to\\\\\\\\ndo both.\\\\\\\\nN to go to your room and face the music. \\\\\\\\nT Audrey.\\\\\\\\nRather than her talk being a generic bitch about your housemates and a\\\\\\\\nnasty screech blaming you for it, Audrey is concerned about you. She\\\\\\\\nbelieves you deserve and can make a happier life for yourself, and that\\\\\\\\nyou two are falling into a rut instead of enjoying life. Looks like\\\\\\\\nshe\\\\\\'s grown from once dumping Duffy for someone trying to buy his\\\\\\\\nfuneral plot early- then dumping him for failing. You don\\\\\\'t have to\\\\\\\\nagree, but repeat T Audrey and choose numbers to keep the conversation\\\\\\\\ngoing. \\\\\\\\nShe\\\\\\'s also moving to Texas and wants you there with her, but you\\\\\\'re not\\\\\\\\nkeen on it. When you tell her this, she\\\\\\'s a bit miffed and begins trying\\\\\\\\nto convince you.\\\\\\\\nYour only option is to say you have work. Not exactly a lie, but you\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nbe starting early. Audrey agrees to talk more about Texas later and you\\\\\\\\nleave on uneasy-but-happy terms. \\\\\\\\nS to get ready to leave.\\\\\\\\nYou have nothing to say to anyone now. Let\\\\\\'s go to work. OUT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChapter 3: Corporate Fret\\\\\\\\nTalk to Trott, read the postcard to learn a little about Delarion Yar\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nhappy ending.\\\\\\\\nTalk to Gibbs when he arrives, and do the same for Audrey when she shows\\\\\\\\nup.\\\\\\\\nAudrey wants to talk to you, but the request is more mundane: can you\\\\\\\\nhelp her friends working at the Bead Store with their register computer?\\\\\\\\nTry talking to the girls as they set up their ill-advised ritual. X\\\\\\\\nregister. A cable appears to be causing the problem for the PC. Ooh, a\\\\\\\\npretty crystal ball holder. Take Holder.\\\\\\\\nTake cable. \\\\\\\\nTo get back to it more quickly, STAND UP. Everyone is fine, Casey even\\\\\\\\nseems a bit too happy that the lights have blown. Sydney may need help.\\\\\\\\nX her...\\\\\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\'s not Sydney. The Not-Sydney has weird demon eyes, is floating\\\\\\\\nand has now summoned a...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSkeleton: Duffy knows that skeletons, if they are like role-playing\\\\\\\\nskeletons, are vulnerable to blunt force. Where\\\\\\'s a good bludgeon...the\\\\\\\\ncrystal ball holder. Attack with holder!\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, Duffy\\\\\\'s afterthoughts inspire the Not-Sydney demon to\\\\\\\\nplay with the funny little monsters and rules of D&D. At least they\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\nwell-known, right?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChapter Four: Necrotic Progression\\\\\\\\nAfter the crickets stop, Gibbs pulls everyone out of the store with\\\\\\\\nplans to escape the mall, which is now in lock-down. You, as Duffy, have\\\\\\\\nnow been entrusted with being the group tank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe only other person we care about in the mall is Trott (and even if we\\\\\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t care, he knows how to open the doors) so let\\\\\\'s go find him. You\\\\\\\\nmight as well drop that holder, as it\\\\\\'s broken.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith Trott being as smart as he is, he would have gone to security to\\\\\\\\nfind a way to lock out monsters or find weapons. We have to make sure\\\\\\\\nhe\\\\\\'s okay either way. Go east twice and then south to get back to your\\\\\\\\nstore. Pick up the stool if you want to use another blunt object. E to\\\\\\\\nback office, x handprint on the window. X shelves, then LOOK IN\\\\\\\\ncardboard box to get the Sierra Hobbies Gamer Glove. N to move on from\\\\\\\\ndumping ground to lounge. Open the door to get into the security room\\\\\\\\nantechamber. \\\\\\\\nTrott must not have heard us. The doors may be kept shut for a reason.\\\\\\\\nMaybe we haven\\\\\\'t checked everything yet...Damn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZombie: Gibs makes a good start on attacking the zombie but his lacrosse\\\\\\\\nstick is knocked away and you have to save him lest you get two zombies\\\\\\\\non your neck. TAKE STICK and do not let it go. You will need this more\\\\\\\\noften. \\\\\\\\nAttack zombie with stick!\\\\\\\\nTalk to Gibs to see if he is okay and to cheer him up with the story of\\\\\\\\nlosing your virginity...on 9/11.\\\\\\\\nTrott is actually quite well and will not turn into a zombie soon, one\\\\\\\\nof the few benefits of being a chubby nerd. He will open doors if you\\\\\\\\nask him nicely. He offers to open the Sports Store door now, but I\\\\\\\\nprefer the \\\\\\'later\\\\\\' option as the girls are just outside and have no\\\\\\\\nweapons. When he gives you the switched-on phone, just talk to Trott\\\\\\\\nwhen you\\\\\\'re back at the sporting goods store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, there may be a few potential improvised weapons in the sport\\\\\\\\nshop, even if it\\\\\\'s just a door knob in a sock. I like taking this moment\\\\\\\\nto talk to Casey, especially about boyfriends, caps and Audrey being\\\\\\\\nhappiest with you. However, get in that store when the screams start!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGhoul: X ghoul. Gibs is brave enough to draw attention away from Audrey,\\\\\\\\nbut becomes paralysed due to direct contact with it. If you haven\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nalready, get those socks from outside the shop. Wear socks (as mittens\\\\\\\\nso they protect your hands). Attack!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAudrey takes you to see if an exit can be found, leaving Casey to look\\\\\\\\nafter Gibs. What she finds instead is a suspected wraith at the perfume\\\\\\\\ncounter and pulls you into the jewelry store to hide.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis part was a bit tricky.\\\\\\\\nTalk to Audrey as the vision unfolds. Empty pleather purse, and take the\\\\\\\\nsilver comb that drops. Wraiths don\\\\\\'t like silver.\\\\\\\\nWhen you first notice Audrey\\\\\\'s shadow acting strangely, attack shadow\\\\\\\\nwith comb. Shadows also hate silver and we don\\\\\\'t want it hurting Audrey.\\\\\\\\nIt will crumble and Duffy will entertain the risky idea of getting the\\\\\\\\nwraith inside to lower the temperature so the safe will open and get rid\\\\\\\\nof the wraith.\\\\\\\\nYell to bring the wraith over. Now it\\\\\\'s a waiting game. Watch\\\\\\\\nAs soon as that sleazy bastard makes the safe lock open, open safe, take\\\\\\\\nsilver rings and then throw those rings at the wraith. It will now turn\\\\\\\\nto dust and it is safe to leave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe make-up kiosk is broken, but there is a bottle of perfume to be\\\\\\\\nsalvaged. Not a gift for Audrey though. Throw that bottle of perfume\\\\\\\\nover the railing to get rid of that horrible smell. \\\\\\\\nIN to enter elevator. Press \\\\\\'Down\\\\\\'. Press \\\\\\'Open Doors\\\\\\'. \\\\\\\\nWest.\\\\\\\\nGhast: This guy hates cleanliness more than a sharehouse slacker. Take\\\\\\\\nwater from the fountain. Throw water from the fountain at it. Even you\\\\\\\\nfeel sorry for the hopeless sap.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor fun, go north, the display case at the Sunglass Hut and grab those\\\\\\\\nshades.\\\\\\\\nLips in Poster Store: Be polite, there\\\\\\'s no need to tempt fate. Listen\\\\\\\\ncarefully to directions out and turn the flip rack to see the posters,\\\\\\\\nsome even relevant to your quest. Remember the candles, text and water.\\\\\\\\nSpectre: Be nice. We\\\\\\'ll need him later. Never tempt the non-immediately\\\\\\\\nhostile creatures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t help the poor dead girl crucified in the cheap paperback\\\\\\\\nbookstore, but the text by her will be helpful. Take text. If you read\\\\\\\\npink text with messed-up capitalization and accusations of being screwed\\\\\\\\nup, you are taking the right things to banish Not-Sydney.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRevenant in Candle Shop: Be nice. Tell him his murderer was the\\\\\\\\nNot-Sydney if you like. Talk to Audrey during the vision. Take menorah.\\\\\\\\nTake the urn from the crappy party favors store. Go back to the\\\\\\\\nfountain. Take water. Put water into urn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGet back to the west side where Gibs and Casey were digging up rubble\\\\\\\\nfor the way out until a vampire lady stole her. We can still save Casey\\\\\\\\nbut we need protection in the form of garlic and to handle that\\\\\\\\npoltergeist throwing stuff at us.\\\\\\\\nPoltergeist: Drop all items at health store. W. Take all. E. Drop all.\\\\\\\\nRepeat this until there is nothing there to play with. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the Health store, search shelf. Take ointment. You will most likely\\\\\\\\nneed this shortly. Move down, move further into the coffin room, then\\\\\\\\ninto the alcove and take the garlic from the trestle. Immediately, you\\\\\\\\nhave triggered the mummy, possibly Guardian of the Garlic? \\\\\\\\nMummy: This guy\\\\\\'s strong, fast and poisonous for being dead for so long,\\\\\\\\nso you can\\\\\\'t take too many hits and running away will only mean you get\\\\\\\\nhit in the back. It can be infuriatingly funny if you make a dash back\\\\\\\\nto the shop during the fight because Gibs will warn that the mummy\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nbehind you just as the last hit and poison is killing you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo...\\\\\\\\nBack to coffin room. South to go out. (Listen for the bang as the mummy\\\\\\\\nhits the bracket). North to go in again. Throw stick at bracket. The\\\\\\\\ntorch will fall and burn the mummy to a crisp. Take stick.\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re touched from the hits: Open jar. Take salve. \\\\\\'Put salve on me\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\nto cure mummy ichor.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSearch the coffin. You will find a blood bag amongst the dried blood.\\\\\\\\nAlways good to have some of the universal type lying around, so take it.\\\\\\\\nGet back to near the fountain. The spectre is friendly enough, despite\\\\\\\\nhis chilly exterior. He\\\\\\'s happy to hold onto the blood for you and keep\\\\\\\\nit in good nick.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nW.\\\\\\\\nVampire: We have our garlic now. Attack with stick to eventually stake\\\\\\\\nheart. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s go NW to get out of here. Not-Sydney is back now, but we have the\\\\\\\\ntools to banish the demon.\\\\\\\\nFollow Audrey\\\\\\'s cue to read the text.\\\\\\\\nAs far as drinking the water goes, we need a virgin. Who is a virgin?\\\\\\\\nWell, not our main characters and Trott\\\\\\'s too far away anyway. Ah, the\\\\\\\\nhead of the ghast you felt sorry for as you defeated it! No one would\\\\\\\\ntouch someone that awful.\\\\\\\\nPour water into the head.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou need to light a candle to finish the banishing ritual. X menorah.\\\\\\\\nNote white candle. Trott will appear and give you a lighter.\\\\\\\\nLight white candle with lighter.\\\\\\\\nNow the demon is defeated and cowed as you explain that your friends\\\\\\\\nthat allegedly slowed you down are the ones who helped you get there,\\\\\\\\nand that the tabletop games fundamentally teach you about working\\\\\\\\ntogether, using your strengths to assist others\\\\\\' weaknesses and\\\\\\\\nprotecting them so that they can repay you.\\\\\\\\nSydney is now safe. Casey is not out of the woods yet, but the main\\\\\\\\ndanger is gone. \\\\\\\\nGibs will be telling you of the time you have left to save Casey. The\\\\\\\\nvampire curse may be gone, but so is a lot of her blood. \\\\\\\\nN.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause you gave the blood bag to the spectre, he will now appear and\\\\\\\\ngive it back. Audrey, being a good medical student, can now start the\\\\\\\\ntransfusion to save her and you immediately know the video store is a\\\\\\\\ngood isolated, dark place for a makeshift surgery. With the help of your\\\\\\\\nfriends, your grit and a lot of D&D knowledge, you have saved a life and\\\\\\\\nmay have kicked smoking. However...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEpilogue\\\\\\\\nStory time. Four months later, Benji\\\\\\'s turned the arcade into something\\\\\\\\nmore like a junk store. With Dance Dance Revolution knock-offs and\\\\\\\\nvomiting dolls. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\\\\\\\nEveryone has pretended the incident never happened. Casey has severed\\\\\\\\nall contact from you. Audrey moved to Texas anyway, leaving you behind.\\\\\\\\nThis portion is conversation dependent, so talk a bit to Trott.

I apologize ahead of time for any unhandy hints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCody Sandifer (sandifer@crmse.sdsu.edu)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE SOLUTION:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, studies in museums have shown that people are more likely to\\\\\\\\nturn right than left, so the order of the solutions might be backwards.\\\\\\\\nNo, I am not kidding about the studies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe \"endgame\" puzzles are two or three pages down the line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find your way across the puddle in the laundromat...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI suppose that you already tried to jump the darn thing. It won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work,\\\\\\\\nbut it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fun to try anyway. I included mop as a verb only because a\\\\\\\\nplaytester suggested it -- there isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t a mop anywhere. Perhaps you could\\\\\\\\ncover the puddle with something? The something would have to be large in\\\\\\\\nan absorbent kind of way, making the puddle safe to walk upon. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s on\\\\\\\\nthe floor somewhere. In the pub. If you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find a container, you\\\\\\\\nshould do some serious searching -- especially in the tank area. You can\\\\\\\\nprobably figure out the next step yourself. What kind of machine hangs\\\\\\\\nout in a laundromat? The date on the receptacle is a clue, albeit a lame\\\\\\\\none. Put the dollar coin in the vertical slot. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the money!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the valuable rock in the rock museum...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCitizens of Chewton installed an alarm, but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re rather,\\\\\\\\nahhh......stupid. The key isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t difficult to find once you take this\\\\\\\\nfact into account. I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use invisiclues, so I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just type in the\\\\\\\\nanswer backwards: (.elbat eht rednu si yek ehT) Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bother holding the\\\\\\\\nclue up to a mirror -- you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just get confused. The letters are\\\\\\\\nforwards even though the words are backwards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the bikers to leave the bar...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou could act on your violent desires, but that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just get you\\\\\\\\npoetically smacked around. They seem to be intent on completing their\\\\\\\\nritual -- remember the perfect note? I bet you could find one. If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\nlooking for a tape recorder, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bother. I decided that there was way\\\\\\\\ntoo much random noise to allow players to tape everything audible. Plus,\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d probably get sick of hearing \"Why would you want to tape that?\" a\\\\\\\\nmillion times. Oh yeah -- the note is in a lofty place. Those choruses\\\\\\\\nreally know their stuff. You haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been to heaven, you say? Take a\\\\\\\\ngood look at the pebbles on the tank. Then throw something at them --\\\\\\\\nbut make sure you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t stolen the smock first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the mechanic to pay any attention to you...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven with the hints I programmed into the game? Really? Kick \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'em twice.\\\\\\\\nIf you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t, your thoughts will nag you 50 turns later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find anything to give the mechanic...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTake a good look at the objects in the pub. Specifically, the (elbat\\\\\\\\nloop). Is this backwards thing annoying you? I hate reading clues before\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m ready, so I figured that this is a fair compromise. If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\ndyslexic, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m probably destroying whatever letter sense you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve developed\\\\\\\\nthrough years of hard work. Sorry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the money from the juggler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hat...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis one is pretty tough, actually. To get the cash, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to\\\\\\\\ndistract the juggler. If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already thrown something at the\\\\\\\\njuggler, you should try it out. If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re still stuck, take a good look\\\\\\\\nat what she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s juggling. The balls are round. Sound familiar?\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, throw another round item at the juggler. If I haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nscrewed up, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only one other round item in the game. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the\\\\\\\\n(kcor elbaulav). If you *still* can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get it to work, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because the\\\\\\\\nrock (darn, I just ruined it) doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t look enough like the balls. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nspecial about the balls? You got it: (egnaro er\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'yeht). You can turn the\\\\\\\\nrock (egnaro) by painting it twice. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not sure that this would work in\\\\\\\\nreal life, which is why I added the bit about the paint \"doing funny\\\\\\\\nthings sometimes\" if you ask the salesman about the paint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t figure out what to do with the corn dogs...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhatever you do, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t eat them. I left the obnoxious hunger daemon out\\\\\\\\nof the game. If you chow down, the game will be unwinnable. So, what to\\\\\\\\ndo? As any good American will tell you, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nice to have money. ($8\\\\\\\\nworth, in this game) I provided a heavy-handed hint in the description\\\\\\\\nof the cart. Try selling them. If that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re\\\\\\\\nnot dressed appropriately. Would you buy a corn dog from a weirdo on the\\\\\\\\nstreet? Even one as good-looking as you are? A salesperson should at\\\\\\\\nleast *look* official. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need the smock in the uniform shop. The\\\\\\\\ncorn dogs should be in the cart before you try selling them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find a way to get the smock...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDid you read the description carefully when you tried to get the smock?\\\\\\\\n(You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll never get the tailor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s attention, so don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bother. Not even by\\\\\\\\ndancing.) There are a number of actions in the game that your conscience\\\\\\\\nwon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t allow you to do. This is one of them. Is there a way around your\\\\\\\\nconscience? Maybe if you (knurd tog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t figure out what to do with the whiskey...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry drinking the whiskey again. Be sure to read the reaction carefully.\\\\\\\\n(I really did try to hint at most of the solutions in the game.)\\\\\\\\n\"Straight\" implies that you might be able to drink the whiskey with\\\\\\\\nsomething else. A (ados) will do the trick, although you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need money\\\\\\\\nto buy one first. Once you get drunk, try acting slightly immoral. You\\\\\\\\nknow -- steal some stuff. At one point, I considered running a \"guilt\"\\\\\\\\ndaemon late in the game to make the player feel bad. I never got around\\\\\\\\nto it, though.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the goddam (or goddamn, according to my progressive\\\\\\\\nspellchecker) apple without the old man checking out your action...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try to take, kick, and throw stuff at the apple. You can try to\\\\\\\\nhassle the old man. None of it will work. The only way to get rid of the\\\\\\\\nold man is to satisfy his craving. Buy him a little boy! (Just kidding.\\\\\\\\nThe dirty old man isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t Michael Jackson.) You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to scrounge up 8\\\\\\\\nbucks first. Once you get the (nig), let him have it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve satisfied the mechanic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s requirement.  What do I do now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDid you tell him about the parade? He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in need of a good convincing. At\\\\\\\\nthis point, you should be painfully aware of your (redneg). Use it to\\\\\\\\nyour advantage. (It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s probably too late to warn you, but I disallowed\\\\\\\\n[kcuf] as an option. Aside from 40 goddams and 20 hells, I decided to\\\\\\\\nkeep the game relatively clean.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHOW PARADE GOT ITSELF MADE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore I start, I want to apologize if you find this overly\\\\\\\\nself-indulgent. Personally, I enjoy behind-the-scenes analyses of\\\\\\\\nmovies, books, and other kinds of arty things. I thought others might\\\\\\\\nfeel the same way, so I put my thoughts to paper. If anything else, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nbe glad to have this record for whenever I get motivated to write\\\\\\\\nanother game. Here goes!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter a long break, I got back into playing interactive fiction games\\\\\\\\nlate in 1996. Flames of Perdition was a whole mess of fun, but I was\\\\\\\\nimpressed that games such as Wedding and Uncle Zebulon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Will were\\\\\\\\nplayable, entertaining, and (most importantly of all) SHORT! I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nwant to spend an entire year on a game (or two, or three -- you know who\\\\\\\\nyou are). I figured that I could bust out a game in three weeks. And --\\\\\\\\nyou know what -- I *did* bust out a game in three weeks. Version 1,\\\\\\\\nanyway.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore I began programming, I read the manual, drew a map, and penciled\\\\\\\\nin objects and puzzles. (Not that the outline was in its the final form,\\\\\\\\nmind you. Looking over my notes, I originally included a golf course at\\\\\\\\nthe eastern end of the parade and a couple of additional puzzles: (1)\\\\\\\\nstealing money from an organ grinder monkey, and (2) escaping from the\\\\\\\\nvan (initially) by popping a balloon with the lighter. In case you were\\\\\\\\nwondering, I got sick of programming and canned the extra puzzles.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe introduction was the very first thing I wrote, which is probably why\\\\\\\\nit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s so damn long. One playtester complained about its length, but I\\\\\\\\ndecided to leave it as-is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUp next was the daily typing ritual. Over Christmas break, I programmed\\\\\\\\nfor three weeks straight -- sometimes, up to 10 hours/day. (I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m a\\\\\\\\ncollege student, which was how I found the time. I originally had four\\\\\\\\nor five college references in the game, although I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve since deleted most\\\\\\\\nof them. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s probably some truth to the advice about \"writing what\\\\\\\\nyou know\", but i-f games with collegiate themes bug the hell out of me.\\\\\\\\nKissing the Buddha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Feet is a prominent exception.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a TADS beginner, I spent most of the original 3 weeks figuring out\\\\\\\\nhow to implement the puzzles in TADS. I averaged about a puzzle a day.\\\\\\\\nAlthough most experienced programmers advise against it, my working room\\\\\\\\ndescriptions were short lists of objects and actors (you know, like the\\\\\\\\nold Scott Adams type of games). I wrote most of the room descriptions\\\\\\\\nthe day before I shipped out Version 1 to playtesters. Since Parade was\\\\\\\\na relatively small game, it worked out OK. I would advise against it for\\\\\\\\nlarger games.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some concerns I had early on:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Parade takes place in the real world (sorta), I had to restrict\\\\\\\\nthe player\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s movement with something other than cave-ins and giant\\\\\\\\nBalrogs. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how I thought of the train. Eventually, I walled the\\\\\\\\nplayer in with the parade itself. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe whole money thing was a real pain. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m just now learning how to\\\\\\\\nprogram indistinguishable objects, so an entire inventory of droppable\\\\\\\\nmoney (both coins *and* bills) was out of the question. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how I\\\\\\\\ncame up with an undroppable wad of cash that incremented only in whole\\\\\\\\ndollar amounts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDue the lack of female leads in i-f, I knew from the start that I wanted\\\\\\\\nthe player to be a woman. Also, I thought it would be tremendously funny\\\\\\\\nto provoke a gender re- evaluation halfway through the game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore initial playtesting:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHeaven and hell didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t exist. (If you didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find hell, you can get\\\\\\\\nthere by trying some of the \"fun stuff\" that I outlined.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bikers (arbitrarily, I now realize) left the pub after 4 visits.\\\\\\\\nThis mystified most playtesters, since there was no sign of their\\\\\\\\ndeparture other than a brief \"The table\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s free!\" comment when the player\\\\\\\\nre-entered the pub. The apple could be found by searching the pool table\\\\\\\\n-- it had fallen into one of the pockets. Also, in contrast to the rest\\\\\\\\nof the characters, the bikers had no personality to speak of. \"Rocks\"\\\\\\\\nwas how one playtester described them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t nudge the player with thoughts about getting the mechanic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nattention.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter initial playtesting:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI gave the bikers personalities and made it obvious when they left the\\\\\\\\npub. After exiting a second time, the bikers pushed the player aside and\\\\\\\\nwandered into the crowd. To find the apple, you still had to search the\\\\\\\\npool table.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI added a ton of inspectable objects, new verbs, and minor bug fixes.\\\\\\\\nSome major bug fixes, too. If you dropped the apple in the initial\\\\\\\\nversion, you could never pick it back up. \"But you already have the\\\\\\\\napple!\" Oops. Also, you could get the old man wasted with the gin\\\\\\\\nwithout ever trying to pick up the apple. Since the player has to be\\\\\\\\naware of his/her sex before confronting the apple-munching mechanic,\\\\\\\\nthis made the game impossible to win.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI still didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t include the nudging \"thoughts\" about getting the\\\\\\\\nmechanic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s attention. As a result, some players (still) had no idea why\\\\\\\\nthe hell getting the apple was so damn important. Since getting the\\\\\\\\napple is the motivation for the whole plot, I thought it best to pound\\\\\\\\nthe player with hints if s/he didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t smack the mechanic a few times. (In\\\\\\\\nretrospect, I now see the dangers in programming a highly linear game\\\\\\\\nwhere leaving a single puzzle unsolved can screw up everything.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI wrote a bunch more atmospheric texts. (e.g. \"The paint salesman rolls\\\\\\\\nhis eyes.\") Originally, there were 5-7 per noisy room. I ended up with\\\\\\\\n10-15 per room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSomewhere around final playtesting:   (some modifications just before, \\\\\\\\nsome just after)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI included plurals. (\"The clowns doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t appear appetizing\" really\\\\\\\\nstarted to annoy me.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI changed the bikers into a puzzle. Getting them to leave was no longer\\\\\\\\narbitrary. (At this point, the afterlife already existed -- but purely\\\\\\\\nfor fun. Only those players who threw something at the tank could find\\\\\\\\nit. Finally, I realized that I could tie heaven to the bikers by giving\\\\\\\\nthem musical tendencies.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI made the apple fall to the floor. At first, I left the apple on the\\\\\\\\ntable when the bikers left -- until someone pointed out that you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nneed to bend over to pick up an apple off the surface of a pool table.\\\\\\\\nSo, I made the apple fall off the table and wedge itself. No complaints\\\\\\\\nabout apples rolling on sawdust, please.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI modified the smock slightly. Many playtesters pointed out that wearing\\\\\\\\nthe (originally tight) smock was a valid solution to the wedged apple\\\\\\\\npuzzle. I got around this by (1) making the smock loose and (2)\\\\\\\\ngenerating an appropriate message when the player goes for the apple\\\\\\\\nwhile wearing the smock. Unfair? Maybe so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI added in a few other comedy bits (esp. the Giant Sack).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI downsized the Mound of Quartz room description. The original Mound of\\\\\\\\nQuartz room description included the information that now pops up when\\\\\\\\nyou inspect the upper class. It was overwhelming (still is, maybe),\\\\\\\\nwhich is why I backgrounded the unnecessary detail. Also, I moved the\\\\\\\\nATM machine from the Mound of Quartz to the Minimall Entrance to make\\\\\\\\nthe Quartz room description more manageable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLikewise, because I was unhappy with my writing, I erased or relocated\\\\\\\\nmost of the original Uniform Shop room description. The wind, ghost, and\\\\\\\\nominously looming objects are brand new. (Not even seen by the final\\\\\\\\nplaytesters, actually. I bet that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how typos creep in.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn one playtester\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s suggestion, I disallowed the use of \"all\" with\\\\\\\\nnearly every verb: all but \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'get\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'put\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'take\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'drop\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'. The\\\\\\\\nplaytester had used \"smell all\" as a way to get a quick list of every\\\\\\\\ninspectable object. He had even solved the perfect note puzzle this way.\\\\\\\\n(Note, however, that the use of \"examine all\" allowed early playtesters\\\\\\\\nto figure out which items I accidentally omitted from room descriptions.\\\\\\\\nIn Version 1, I had forgotten to include the bulletin board (Rock\\\\\\\\nMuseum) and desk (Garage).)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost playtesters still didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like the late revelation of the player\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nsex. (Which can come *really* late now that getting the bikers to leave\\\\\\\\nis a puzzle.) After wavering back and forth for a couple of weeks, I\\\\\\\\ndecided not to give in to peer pressure. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the suggestion of playtesters, I added in a few more things for the\\\\\\\\nplayer to do when drunk (jumping over the puddle and reading the porno\\\\\\\\nmag, in particular).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI included standard TADS instructions (with a few minor changes to\\\\\\\\ninteractions with characters) just because I could.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHell was created for my own amusement.  Since there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a heaven, why not?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChanges for v2.2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI corrected a major bug in the pub. Before the bug fix, TADS allowed\\\\\\\\nplayers to \"show\" every visible item. Thus, it was possible for the\\\\\\\\noffended biker to grind the bartender, the old man, and the pool table\\\\\\\\nbeneath his boot. Man, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one powerful boot. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI made it easier to get to hell. Rather than solve the puzzles in a\\\\\\\\nparticular order, the player can now get to hell by throwing an object\\\\\\\\nat the tank *after* stealing the smock. Jumping over the puddle while\\\\\\\\ndrunk now transports the player to limbo. You can also get to limbo by\\\\\\\\nriding the train. Thanks to Admiral Jota for the smock-stealing\\\\\\\\nsuggestion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe player can now become a hobo by climbing on the train. I did this\\\\\\\\nmainly as a programming exercise to see if I could get the train to\\\\\\\\nstart and stop like the elephant in Graham Nelson\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \"The Meteor, the\\\\\\\\nStone, and the Tall Glass of Sherbet.\" (Sorry if I remembered the title\\\\\\\\nincorrectly.) Thanks to Stephen Granade for the train-hopping\\\\\\\\nsuggestion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClosing comments:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe playtesting and revising of games takes a *lot* of time. Version 1\\\\\\\\n(130k) came out in January. The first public version of Parade (Version\\\\\\\\n2.1 @ 264k) came out in March 1997. Before the final release, I must\\\\\\\\nhave played my own game 30 damn times. At least.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, writing this game was a lot of fun! Give it a try! To this end,\\\\\\\\nhere are a few hints for those who want to give TADS a try. I highly\\\\\\\\nrecommend it. (To help persuade you, keep in mind that, before TADS, my\\\\\\\\nlast bout with programming was a beginning Pascal course in 1986.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTADS ADVICE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMERS:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you think it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll help, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d be glad to share code with anyone\\\\\\\\ninterested in programming. Otherwise, here are some helpful hints for\\\\\\\\nhopeful programmers:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The Synonym and -> shortcuts save a lot of typing. Use \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'em whenever\\\\\\\\npossible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Programming doVerbPrep(actor,iobj) stuff is a real pain (as in \"cover\\\\\\\\npuddle with sawdust\", where \"puddle\" is the important object for the\\\\\\\\nverb). Redirect the ioVerbPrep action to the doVerbPrep like it says in\\\\\\\\nthe Book of the Parser. Otherwise, the doVerbPrep never gets accessed.\\\\\\\\n(Can you say 2 wasted hours? I can.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Take care of important details as you stumble across them. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t wait\\\\\\\\nuntil later! For example, I programmed the responses to the improper use\\\\\\\\nof the paint machine (while the safety door was open, etc.) because I\\\\\\\\nknew that I would forget later on. Your playtesters will get cranky if\\\\\\\\nyou don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t anticipate these details. Speaking of which...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Use playtesters. They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re nuts, but they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re a big help. Like I said,\\\\\\\\nVersion 1 was only 130k.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Use the plurals.t module on ftp.gmd.de if you want to incorporate\\\\\\\\nplurals. (Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget bugs.t, too!) This module may become pronouns.t\\\\\\\\nin the future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. Be sure that you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t modify a class property (the container class\\\\\\\\nverDoLookin property, e.g.) more than once. Unfortunately, the compiler\\\\\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t warn you when this happens; it just keeps the latest\\\\\\\\nmodification.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. In a related topic, be sure to check ADV.T before you modify a class\\\\\\\\nproperty. You might wipe out something important. (By the way, both\\\\\\\\nADV.T and STD.T are worth a good look before you start.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. Unless you modify ADV.T, TADS allows players to \"put\" things that\\\\\\\\nthey aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t carrying. This can lead to serious bugs if you forget to\\\\\\\\nblock the \"put\" verb for inaccessible items (a wedged apple, for\\\\\\\\ninstance). If you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t believe me, put the bush from Unnkulian I in the\\\\\\\\nbucket. Or, put the gold bar, anchor, or bookmark from Unnkulian II on\\\\\\\\nthe went board. My solution was to forbid the player from \"putting\"\\\\\\\\nanything that he or she isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t carrying; Inform does the same thing. (I\\\\\\\\nshould know, since I stole Inform\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s default \"put\" response.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. If you replace the default ldesc (long description) of a surface or\\\\\\\\ncontainer object, any attempt to look in or search the container/surface\\\\\\\\nwill call up the response \"There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s nothing on/in the surface/container.\"\\\\\\\\nSilly, I know. Bugs.t repairs this oversight.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n10. If you want to trigger a daemon more than once, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget to\\\\\\\\nreset its counter to zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11. Watch James Cagney movies. Public Enemy, Strawberry Blonde, and\\\\\\\\nWhite Heat are good places to start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n12. If you replace one object with another (a live monkey with a dead\\\\\\\\none, for example), don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget to setit(new_object). This way, the\\\\\\\\npronoun \"it\" will refer to the new object.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n13. Create separate files (verbs.t, modifications.t, actors.t,\\\\\\\\npaint_shop.t, etc.) from the very beginning. This makes it *much* easier\\\\\\\\nto locate code for future revisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your own damn game. Do whatever the hell you want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n15. Read the manual and download lots of source code. If that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nwork, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be afraid to look like an idiot on rec.arts.i-f. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be\\\\\\\\nglad to keep you company.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'This is a walkthrough for Emily Short\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s _Pytho\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Mask_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX MINISTER\\\\\\\\nA - \"Have you seen the comet before?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"Who sails it?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"What does mythology say of the comet?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"Even a brief example would interest me, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m sure.\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"Are there other stories about the comet?\"\\\\\\\\nB - \"Are there any old stories about the Kings?\"\\\\\\\\nB - \"What happened between the Earth woman and the king?\"\\\\\\\\nC - \"Are there any old stories about the Moon?\"\\\\\\\\nTOPIC MOON\\\\\\\\nA - \"How long ago did you join the cabinet?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"Is there dissension in the cabinet?\"\\\\\\\\nTOPIC CABINET\\\\\\\\nA - \"Why did the Prince leave the cabinet?\"\\\\\\\\nB - \"What do you think of the Earth minister?\"\\\\\\\\nTOPIC CABINET\\\\\\\\nA - \"What do you think of the Court Physician?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"What do you think is happening to the king?\"\\\\\\\\nA - \"It was a pleasure speaking to you.\"\\\\\\\\nLOOK\\\\\\\\nI\\\\\\\\nX PURSE\\\\\\\\nOPEN PURSE\\\\\\\\nX GOLD\\\\\\\\nX SILVER\\\\\\\\nX CAPE\\\\\\\\nX CARD\\\\\\\\nX RING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*** Now we try the sun court ***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEAST\\\\\\\\nX KING\\\\\\\\nTALK TO KING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*** We can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go north yet, but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worth checking out the barrier ***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX FOOTMAN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*** Instead, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s head south to the games room***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nX TABLE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*** Avril will insult us ***\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA - Thank you for rescuing me there.\\\\\\\\nA - I am Soteria.

As well as all\\\\\\\\n  the typical Adventure commands (Take, Give, Examine, Look) you may\\\\\\\\n  well need some slightly less obvious instructions (especially those\\\\\\\\n  regarding the fairer sex...).  One other point to bear in mind,\\\\\\\\n  Gentlemen may Fence but they rarely simply Attack.  On with the show....\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few things not mentioned in this paragraph are two very important\\\\\\\\ncommands.  The first is common in TADS games, which is \"TALK TO X\"\\\\\\\\nwhere X is a character name.  With this command, you can figure out\\\\\\\\nthe game and complete it, but most likely not score above 50/100 points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second is a special command for this game, that being \"SPANK X\", where\\\\\\\\nX is again a character name.  With these two commands you should be able\\\\\\\\nto complete the game with a full score of 100 points...  However, if you\\\\\\\\nare stuck, a blatant walkthrough is listed below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that there is a bug in the game which allows you to amass a\\\\\\\\nscore well above 100.

The precise solutions may not apply to later or earlier versions, or releases in a different format.  Also note that this plot-driven tale relies on a precisely timed series of scenes or events to proceed.  There will be times (indicated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'wait\\\\\\\\\\\\\\') when a certain number of turns, rather than a specific action, will be required for the next event to occur.  While you can spend those turns however you like, I highly recommend taking every opportunity to examine and interact with anything and everything in sight.  The person who simply does what needs to be done to \"win\" won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get nearly as much out of this story as the person who explores every nook and cranny of the Room and its surrounding spaces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRoom 206 is light on puzzles, and death should never occur, but there are a few times you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be asked to perform action that might not be immediately apparent.  You might also hesitate when the way forward seems clear, but morally ambiguous.  This walkthrough should help with those moments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 1: The Chapel\\\\\\\\n>lawn\\\\\\\\n>limousine\\\\\\\\n>take bucket\\\\\\\\n>lawn\\\\\\\\n>path\\\\\\\\n>graveyard\\\\\\\\n>dump bucket\\\\\\\\n>take shoe\\\\\\\\n>path\\\\\\\\n>lawn\\\\\\\\n(note: try interacting with the cat in various ways)\\\\\\\\n>chapel\\\\\\\\n>follow ribbon\\\\\\\\n>take rose\\\\\\\\n>aisle\\\\\\\\n>x program\\\\\\\\n>lawn\\\\\\\\n>path\\\\\\\\n>gazebo\\\\\\\\n>take veil\\\\\\\\n>path\\\\\\\\n>graveyard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPart 2: The Room\\\\\\\\n>bathroom\\\\\\\\n>open cabinet\\\\\\\\n>take pills\\\\\\\\n>room\\\\\\\\n>kitchen\\\\\\\\n>open bar\\\\\\\\n>take liquor\\\\\\\\n>swallow pills with liquor\\\\\\\\n(note: this one\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a freebie, but if you drink any more liquor throughout the game, prepare to be keep drinking it every twenty turns or so)\\\\\\\\n>open fridge\\\\\\\\n>x fridge\\\\\\\\n>take burrito\\\\\\\\n>put burrito in microwave\\\\\\\\n>turn on microwave\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>take burrito\\\\\\\\n>eat burrito\\\\\\\\n>room\\\\\\\\n>answer phone\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>answer phone\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>open door\\\\\\\\n>open tray\\\\\\\\n>take box\\\\\\\\n>turn over tray\\\\\\\\n>x tray\\\\\\\\n>open pillow\\\\\\\\n>turn over tray\\\\\\\\n>put white box on tray\\\\\\\\n>close tray\\\\\\\\n>close door\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>z\\\\\\\\n>answer phone\\\\\\\\n>bathroom\\\\\\\\n>turn on shower\\\\\\\\n>x mirror\\\\\\\\n>room\\\\\\\\n>open door\\\\\\\\n>hallway\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPart 3: The Hotel\\\\\\\\n(note: when you see the maid, you can try performing various actions on her or even asking her about certain rudimentary things)\\\\\\\\n>elevator\\\\\\\\n>down\\\\\\\\n>out\\\\\\\\n>entrance\\\\\\\\n(note: for this part you have to wait until the policeman is looking away before you perform certain actions.

Although, as the\\\\\\\\ngame progresses, you will begin to face enemies that are actually item\\\\\\\\nusage puzzles, the core of the game (and what your score is ultimately\\\\\\\\nbased on) is a resource management puzzle; the general goal is to\\\\\\\\ntrade stamina for damage as efficiently as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBASIC ATTACKS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou have four basic attacks (ATTACK FISH will cue you with them):\\\\\\\\nPUNCH, KICK, SLAP, and BACKHAND.  If they connect, they generally\\\\\\\\ncharge you two stamina and inflict two damage.  KICKs are more likely\\\\\\\\nto be evaded by smaller fish, and evaded kicks in particular will\\\\\\\\ngenerally only cost you a single stamina point.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMBINATION ATTACKS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe cost of a basic attack can vary based on the last few moves you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve\\\\\\\\ndone; this will either deliver extra damage or cost you less stamina\\\\\\\\nto perform.  For example, against most enemies you can use the basic\\\\\\\\n\"one-two\": if you follow up a SLAP with a BACKHAND, the BACKHAND will\\\\\\\\ncost only 1 Stamina but inflict 3 damage.  Thus \"slap/backhand\" is a\\\\\\\\ncombo that costs 3 and inflicts 5.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe difference in combat effectiveness is significant; against the\\\\\\\\nfirst opponent (the rainbow trout, who has no counters other than\\\\\\\\nimmunity to kicks): with a sequence of nothing but slaps, you will\\\\\\\\nneed to attack five times and expend 10 endurance to defeat him. As\\\\\\\\nyou start with only five endurance, this works out to 10 turns of\\\\\\\\nbattle and five attacks. However, if you instead use one-two combos,\\\\\\\\nyou can inflict 10 damage in two iterations, and this means you only\\\\\\\\nneed to rest for a single turn, between the two combinations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRunning out of stamina partway through a combo will interrupt the\\\\\\\\ncombo and is always bad.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent fish have different combinations against which they are\\\\\\\\nvulnerable. Pay attention to the text you get, as combinations in\\\\\\\\nprogress usually have some special text that seem to indicate that a\\\\\\\\nmove was unusually effective. This is worthwhile even if it looks like\\\\\\\\nthere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been no extra damage or lesser stamina cost; sometimes\\\\\\\\ncompleting a combo will trigger a plot event or environmental effect\\\\\\\\nthat will deal loads of damage.  If it looks like a combination hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\npaid off, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s probable that you just haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t extended it far enough\\\\\\\\nyet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoves that do not finish a combination but are nevertheless part of\\\\\\\\nthem may actually not do damage; replies to these often will mention\\\\\\\\nsomething about the fish becoming exposed or moving into a new\\\\\\\\nposition that will suggest a followup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOPTIMIZING YOUR SCORE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe scoring itself is based on, effectively, damage per second (DPS)\\\\\\\\nand damage per attack (DPA); it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s computed based on how long it takes,\\\\\\\\nand how many attacks it took, to take down your foe. Because of the\\\\\\\\ncombat and stamina regeneration model, however, optimizing damage per\\\\\\\\nendurance (DPE) - the most damage for the least stamina cost - will\\\\\\\\nusually optimize both, and so this is the statistic to focus on\\\\\\\\nprimarily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome items will change the damage of your basic attacks; this may\\\\\\\\nchange the total efficiency calculus if you have endurance to\\\\\\\\nburn. There is also a point in the game where you can get a full\\\\\\\\nstamina recharge, which will be necessary to get a perfect score in\\\\\\\\nits fight.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is usually unnecessary to spend the between-fight times preparing\\\\\\\\nitems for the next fight, but it also rarely hurts. When working for a\\\\\\\\nperfect run, save immediately after the ends of fights, not at the\\\\\\\\nbeginnings of the next ones.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSPOILER SPACE BEFORE SPECIFIC HINTS FOR EACH FIGHT\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPER-FISH HINTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrout:        This is a practice fight. Get your combos going, and make\\\\\\\\n              every move count. If you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t perfect this guy, you may\\\\\\\\n              have trouble doing damage fast enough to the enemies\\\\\\\\n              that will actually fight back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBass:         Examining the situation and reacting appropriately will\\\\\\\\n              yield more damage faster than just attacking blindly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClownfish:    This enemy can be one-shotted. Think outside the box.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCatfish:      Just because a move has done no damage doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mean it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\n              not part of a combo.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTuna:         Long, repetitive combos can end with a sizable bang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSwordfish:    Make your combos last as long as they possibly can. Also,\\\\\\\\n              do not run out of stamina while performing them or you\\\\\\\\n              may trigger a game-breaking bug in version 1.1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPufferfish:   You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t touch it directly. Keep the pressure on and\\\\\\\\n              don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t let it close.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShark:        This is a puzzle battle, but keep your combos in mind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nElectric Eel: Protection is available. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to prepare in\\\\\\\\n              advance to overcome its defenses fast enough for a\\\\\\\\n              perfect score. Fortunately, you can rest as much as you\\\\\\\\n              want before he shows up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPiranha:      Mix it up! You cannot safely do any move more than twice. The\\\\\\\\n              crowd\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s chant gives you key to a flawless victory, but\\\\\\\\n              you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to make sure your stamina is at least half\\\\\\\\n              full before you make the first move.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnglerfish:   In defeating the piranha, you will have improved your\\\\\\\\n              basic attack damage. For once, combos are not the whole\\\\\\\\n              of the answer, even once the puzzles are solved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCoelacanth:   To complete this battle as rapidly as possible, you will\\\\\\\\n              need to have satisfied your winning combination\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\n              preconditions in advance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOPTIMUM COMBINATION VALUES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese are targets to shoot for for a maximum score. Some fights may\\\\\\\\nrequire you to prepare in advance during the inter-fight\\\\\\\\nsequences. Others may actually be beaten by careful use of preparation\\\\\\\\nor foreknowledge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrout: 5 turns, 4 attacks\\\\\\\\nBass: 8 turns, 3 attacks \\\\\\\\nClownfish: 1 turn, 0 attacks\\\\\\\\nCatfish: 9 turns, 6 attacks\\\\\\\\nTuna: 20 turns, 10 attacks\\\\\\\\nSwordfish: 22 turns, 11 attacks\\\\\\\\nPufferfish: 16 turns, 6 attacks\\\\\\\\nShark: 15 turns, 6 attacks\\\\\\\\nElectric Eel: 8 turns, 8 attacks\\\\\\\\nPiranha: 11 turns, 6 attacks\\\\\\\\nAnglerfish: 10 turns, 7 attacks\\\\\\\\nCoelacanth: 8 turns, 1 attack\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSPOILER SPACE BEFORE COMPLETE WALKTHROUGH\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFULL WALKTHROUGH\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the exception of the final combination attack, all combos are\\\\\\\\nlisted on a single walkthrough line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Rainbow trout]\\\\\\\\n>SLAP.

But we wrote the game too.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Hi, everybody, and welcome to the annotated walkthrough for Speculative Fiction! Whether you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re stuck in the game, or just curious to see if you missed anything, we hope this walkthrough will be a fun and educational experience! I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m Rory. I play W.D. in the game. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m Martin. I play the wizard. \\\\\\\\nRORY: The wizard doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t officially have a name, but we like to refer to him as Bill. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I prefer Frederick, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re never going to agree on this one. Anyway, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get started. You begin the game in Not a---\\\\\\\\nRORY: Wait. We should explain how this works, first. This walkthrough is divided into a number of parts. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Part 1, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to determine who we are, why we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re here, and what our goals are. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Part 2, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll do a general exploration of the game map, and pick up any freely-available objects. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Part 3, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll solve the easier puzzles. These are pretty straightforward. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to bring a few objects to the right location and combine them. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Part 4, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll solve the harder puzzles. These puzzles have multiple stages, require timing, or both. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Part 5, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll solve the endgame. Now, the endgame _is_ timed, but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also pretty simple, so this bit shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t take too long. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we have time, in Part 6 we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll talk about interesting actions you may want to try, some of which will be hazardous to Bill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health, or to W.D.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s. I should mention that this walkthrough will strive to be pretty thorough - we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll mention actions a player might take even if they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not strictly necessary - examining objects and such. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: But then you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d miss out on all the behind-the-scenes gossip. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 1: WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We begin the game in Not a Dungeon. Your first goal is to figure out what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going on. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x me\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ok, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s kind of a strange description. You get told that your body is unconscious, but you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re giving commands to someone or something. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s see what else is in the room. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x vase\\\\\\\\n> take vase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need this vase eventually, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to take it now. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I really hate that vase. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I know, but we need it for full points. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Bleh. What else is in this room? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x tapestry\\\\\\\\n> x inscription\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: This is just flavor, but it lets you know a little bit about the backstory. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s check out the body. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x body\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the same description as \"x me\". So who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s driving this thing? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> look in mirror\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And there I am! Aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t I awesome? \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: As a side note, \"x you\" also describes W.D. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s examine Frederick the wizard some more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x robe\\\\\\\\n> look in pockets\\\\\\\\n> take wand\\\\\\\\n> x wand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Yay! Magic items! \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wake wizard  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now you have some more idea what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going on. Your mind is inside W.D., giving him directions. \\\\\\\\nThe vase and the wand are the only objects you can get in the room, so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time to escape. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x door\\\\\\\\n> open door\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: W.D. can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get through the door, because he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bird. On the other hand, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bird. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x window\\\\\\\\n> fly out window\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And with a big WOOOSH, W.D. is free. \"d\" doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work to get out of the room initially, but once you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve escaped for the first time, you can use \"u\" and \"d\" to go between Not a Dungeon and Castle Gate. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I have to say, this was probably the hardest scene in the game for me to film. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d think lying there would be easy, but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s really hard to be still! At least Fred\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only supposed to be unconscious, so I could still breathe. \\\\\\\\nRORY: There was that one session where you kept laughing. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You examined the tapestry thirty times in a row! Maybe Frederick was having a funny dream. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Well, his brain is in W.D.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bag, so I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t see how - \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: *cough* Anyway, we eventually got the scene filmed. At this point, W.D. is in Castle Gate and ready to explore the game world proper. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Unfortunately, W.D. cannot break down the doors of the castle, so the relevant thing to see here is the tree. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x tree\\\\\\\\n> climb tree\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This brings us to the top of the tree. You can see a fair amount of the map from here. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x stall\\\\\\\\n> x castle\\\\\\\\n> x magic\\\\\\\\n> x farm\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: This area\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s here to give you a feel for the map. Note that when you examine the magic shop, W.D. says, \"We should go there to ask for advice.\"\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one other thing here. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget the note. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Right, right. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take note\\\\\\\\n> read note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: So one of those pesky tree-climbing humans has left a treasure hunt for his girlfriend. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be following it later. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Fun fact: the models of the other game locations which you can see here? Ken in costuming made them. He makes dollhouses as a hobby. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s working on a replica of the whole game world now. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Wow. I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know that. Cool. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, I learned a lot of neat things about the crew while waiting to film my scenes. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I kind of regret not being able to hang out with people more, but I was on camera basically the whole time. Anyway, we should probably take a break from the shop talk. People are trying to win this thing. So! Mel will give us advice, so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where we should head.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at the south part of Big Street. Mel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s is off of the center section. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a beggar here - \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x beggar\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: But we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to skip the beggar for now. At this point, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not entirely clear what we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re up to. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll come back once we have a reason to bug this guy. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: This is Big Street, Center. It is the greatest location in the game, because it contains Sandie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Hot Meats. Tragically, we need to skip it for now and go to Mel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The room description of the magic shop starts to explain what we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re doing: \"We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re here to ask Mel for a Midas potion.\" \\\\\\\\nRORY: Now, the very first action you take in the magic shop is going to be intercepted by a cut-scene, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just look at the room again. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> l \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your plot dump. Now, that was a lot of text, so let me summarize:\\\\\\\\n   1.) Bill the wizard has been embezzling and just got caught. \\\\\\\\n   2.) The treasurer has to go find the king to get Bill executed.\\\\\\\\n   3.) Bill needs to fill the treasury back up before that happens. \\\\\\\\n   4.) If we get Mel lots and lots and lots of money, he will sell us the ingredients to make a potion that turns all the fake treasure in the treasury to gold.    \\\\\\\\n   5.) Profit.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the first time I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve seen one of those lists where the item before \"Profit\" isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t \"???\". \\\\\\\\nRORY: Well, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, \"Get Mel lots and lots of money\", which might as well be \"???\"\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I guess it wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be a game if it were obvious. So, there are a lot of things going on in this location. First, Mel speaks Raven. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the one NPC you can have real conversations with. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ask mel about money\\\\\\\\n> ask mel about wizard\\\\\\\\n> ask mel about wand\\\\\\\\n> ask mel about potion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Some of these are hints, and some are just flavor. If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already tried waving the wand, you should do that. About half of the responses in \"ask mel about money\" actually correspond to things you can do in game. He also has opinions on many of the other NPCs. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Including a backhanded compliment about poor Frederick. Sniff sniff. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Also, this is where we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll come back to in order to cash in completed puzzles. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also where we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll make the Midas potion. That will be later, though. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: There are also several items in the shop. The cockroaches are there to look cool. The trinkets we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll deal with later. We can take the balloon now. Then we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll head off to the southeast corner of the shop. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Yeah - now that we know the plot, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to do a rapid-fire run through of the map, taking objects and looking for puzzle pointers. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 2: RUN AROUND THE MAP AND TAKE STUFF\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take balloon\\\\\\\\n> se\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The alchemy bench is full of items which aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t nailed down. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll take all of them. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x dye\\\\\\\\n> take dye\\\\\\\\n> x clear\\\\\\\\n> take clear\\\\\\\\n> x book\\\\\\\\n> read book\\\\\\\\n> read page\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: There are three bottles of blue dye, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to solve the puzzles in an order such that we only need one. You can come back here if you use up or destroy a bottle. (Or you can just take all three at once.) Also, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the whole spellbook; just the relevant page. \\\\\\\\nRORY: The solvent actually works, if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wondering. The prop for the spellbook is now blank due to an accident with the \"clear fluid\". \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Rory carefully neglects to mention who caused the accident. \\\\\\\\nRORY: HEY GUYS I SPILLED THE SOLVENT ON THE BOOK. ::cough:: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> nw\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re back at Big Street, South. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s check out the beggar in more detail. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x beggar\\\\\\\\n> x cup\\\\\\\\n> look in cup\\\\\\\\n> x strange\\\\\\\\n> take strange\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Okay, so the beggar can hear us, but not see us. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s got some kind of rare coin, but we can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get it from him yet. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> x stall\\\\\\\\n> x sandie\\\\\\\\n> x pans\\\\\\\\n> excitement pan\\\\\\\\n> ask sandie about meat\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Sandie can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t speak Raven, but she does know who we are. There are a couple of NPCs who know that W.D. is a special raven and will treat him a little bit more like a person. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take salt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s salt and pepper here. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m cheating a bit in that I know we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need the salt and won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the pepper. But hey, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re reading a walkthrough--- for the delicious cheating. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s infinite salt here, but you can only take one packet at a time. If you use it up, you can come back to Sandie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s to get another packet. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I need to interrupt for a minute and put a plug in for Alessandra, here. She plays Sandie, and she was an absolute _delight_ to work with. She\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s professional, she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s funny ... if you are trying to write a female character in your game and you need someone, I really recommend her work. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I have to second that. We tried to get her in here to help with the walkthrough, but she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s got a gig as an evil sorceress in a dungeon crawl right now. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The salt is the only thing we really need here for now, so it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s off towards Moneyville.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: This area is _mostly_ a hub. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one thing to check out:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x cord\\\\\\\\n> pull cord\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Well, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s exciting! We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be back to deal with the cord in more detail later. Conveniently, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been moved to the Bank Lobby. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x forms\\\\\\\\n> x poster\\\\\\\\n> x man\\\\\\\\n> take poster\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: All humans look kind of alike to W.D. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Which is speciesism. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Anyway, we can take the poster. It describes Two-Handed Bart, horrible bank robber. \\\\\\\\nRORY: \"Horrible\" because he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s bad at it. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: What? No, no, the fact that he robs banks is horrible ... er, moving on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> x teller\\\\\\\\n> ask teller about loan\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The teller doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t speak Raven. If we want to communicate with her, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need another way. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x chandelier\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the cord we saw outside the bank earlier.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x cord\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see the cord in the guard tower too. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the bank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s alarm system. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> break cord\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: But we can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do anything about it from here. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This is the Stock Market. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an auction going on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x auctioneer\\\\\\\\n> x coffer\\\\\\\\n> x merchants\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: There are also a lot of animals. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x animals\\\\\\\\n> animals, hi\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Some of the animals are pretty nervous.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: If you stick around for a few turns, you can watch the auctions going on. For now, there aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t any objects we can take. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> sw \\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Mindo Street lets us get into the guard tower, and also has a cool statue. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I hear the statue is actually modeled after the father of one of the writers, as a sort of cameo. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Really? I heard it was the set designer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ex. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Huh. Well, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s someone. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x statue\\\\\\\\n> x plaque\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Cute. Time for the guard tower. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> x bell\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the last part of the alarm system. If you try to ring the bell from in here, you just annoy the guard. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x guard\\\\\\\\n> x mustache\\\\\\\\n> take mustache\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Sound sleeper. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s artistic license. I tried that thing on. It _hurts_. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x wastebasket\\\\\\\\n> take vellum\\\\\\\\n> read vellum\\\\\\\\n> x signature\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Apparently Bill the Wizard was up to something other than just embezzling pre-game. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This letter relates to a mysterious device which we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see in a few turns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x tunic\\\\\\\\n> take key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m now going to show you the evidence cabinet and then walk you through two ways of not opening it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x cabinet\\\\\\\\n> x crack\\\\\\\\n> look in crack\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t examine the scrap and the device without opening the cabinet, which you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do yet. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x lock\\\\\\\\n> break lock\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Failure 1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> unlock lock with key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Failure 2. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give key to guard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Say it with me, folks: \"We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be back to deal with this later.\" We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re giving the key back to the guard now because he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the only person who can open the cabinet. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> up\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at the barracks. We can finally take some more objects. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x blanket\\\\\\\\n> take blanket\\\\\\\\n> take bit\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Mmm, a smelly blanket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x guard\\\\\\\\n> x forms\\\\\\\\n> x stamp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The signature is, in fact, the treasurer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x guard\\\\\\\\n> x tunic\\\\\\\\n> take pouch\\\\\\\\n> open pouch\\\\\\\\n> take florin\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: They really don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t hire the guards for their alertness, do they? \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The guy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been stamping paperwork for sixteen hours. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I guess. As we learned with the guard downstairs, tunics contain exciting objects. This guard has ... A SINGLE FLORIN!!! Our first real money!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t try to turn the florin in to Mel, though. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to turn one florin into many before we have anything worthwhile. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Off to the last few game locations. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> d\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ah, the sea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take rod\\\\\\\\n> x rod\\\\\\\\n> wave rod\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The fishing wand generates a variety of forms of bait. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> eat \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to eat the bait to get rid of it for now. Our props deparment failed to get us duplicates of some relevant items - there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only one \"salt\" and one \"faery coin\" and one \"bait\", so you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be able to get another one until you dispose of the first one. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, in an ironic twist, it turned out a certain someone was stealing from the props budget...\\\\\\\\nRORY: Legally, we can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t mention her name, but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Also it rhymes with \"Mendolyn\". \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x scarecrow\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The end of that description is not a typo. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x hat\\\\\\\\n> take hat\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: For convenience, you can refer to it as a hat. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: So what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s up with the circle and the barrel? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> read sign\\\\\\\\n> x circle\\\\\\\\n> x barrel\\\\\\\\n> take fish\\\\\\\\n> enter circle\\\\\\\\n> take fish\\\\\\\\n> eat fish\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: I would like to point out that I am claustrophobic and this was not fun to film. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m going to go get some air. Martin, you deal with this bit. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ok. So W.D. is trapped in a magical cage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x cage\\\\\\\\n> open cage\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: It doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t open on its own. (We filmed a scene where if you waited for twenty turns, a fisherman would come and throw you into the ocean. That got cut for being too gruesome.) Violence turns out to be the solution to this one. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: W.D. can break out in 1 to 3 turns, so you may have to try multiple times. Now we have a treacherous source of fish. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> exit circle\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> sw \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, Rory - we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at the Farmland. You can come back. Rory? Hrm. From the farmland, we can go into the cottage or over to the barn. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also a hedgehog. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x hedgehog\\\\\\\\n> hedgehog, hi\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The hedgehog and W.D. can understand each other, but communication is still difficult. The notable thing here is that the hedgehog is hungry. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve played the Introcomp release, you probably remember the cottage. In the full game, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a second room further to the south. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s check out the fireplace. We can ignore the farming tools. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x fireplace\\\\\\\\n> x chimney\\\\\\\\n> take brick\\\\\\\\n> take parchment\\\\\\\\n> x parchment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: If you remember all the way back to \"ask mel about money\", he does happen to mention insurance fraud. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x scarf\\\\\\\\n> take scarf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Fashion!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> x basket\\\\\\\\n> x lever\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: W.D. has a serious egg problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take egg\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Really serious. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n> take egg\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: _Really_ serious. There are an infinite number of eggs and W.D. has infinite stomach capacity. Hm. Is Rory back? No? Rory got _really_ sick doing this scene. Rory does not have infinite stomach capacity. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This brings us to the barn, which is the final location in the main map. Here we have a beautiful, brand-new building, which we now know was just insured for some amount of money, hopefully a large amount. Our path is clear. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m back! I brought coffee. I got you a latte. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Thanks, Rory. Also, good timing. I was just about to start solving puzzles. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Awesome. Time to burn down the barn? \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Time to burn down the barn. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 3: TIME TO BURN DOWN THE BARN, AND OTHER SIMPLE PUZZLES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve jumped straight to Part 3, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at the Barn. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x hay\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: This hay is very dry. It would be a shame if something happened to it. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now, we don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t directly have a fire source, but if you examine our vast pile of objects, we do have an explosion source. \\\\\\\\nRORY: (If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already waved the magic wand to get a faery coin, you should do that now.) \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wave wand\\\\\\\\n> take coin\\\\\\\\n> x coin\\\\\\\\n> x salt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Faery coins explode if you put salt on them. We have salt. Now, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not a very big explosion; don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go thinking you can blow off the castle doors. But this hay is quite dry ... \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put faery on hay\\\\\\\\n> put salt on faery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And now we _leave_. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re feeling suicidal, you can stand there and watch W.D. burn to death, but we like winning. \\\\\\\\nRORY: And in case you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re worrying that I have a poor charred stunt double somewhere, _that_ scene was CGI. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: In your playthrough, we encourage you to stop at Farmland and watch the barn burn down, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to get a move on. \\\\\\\\nRORY: This next bit is different from Introcomp. In the initial release, there was an insurance salesman at the stock market who you could turn the policy into. Now you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to turn it in at the bank. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> give parchment to teller\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Yay money!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m going to walk you through giving the check to Mel now. This will teach you about buying ingredients. After this, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just hold them till the end. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> give check to mel\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve gotten the right to buy one ingredient. For full points, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to buy all seven. You can win the game starting with the four-ingredient potion. \\\\\\\\nRORY: If you are playing the game on your own and not just following the walkthrough, we recommend not buying any ingredients until you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve given up on puzzles. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Right. The five-ingredient potion needs a different set from the four-ingredient potion. So you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to buy three ingredients and then realize they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re only useful if you manage to finish all seven puzzles. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> buy ingredient\\\\\\\\n> midas potion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re actually saying \"Midas potion\" here because that backs you out of the buying dialog. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve successfully gotten the check out of our inventory; we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll buy all seven ingredients at once later. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll do Puzzle 2: The Riddle Trail.\\\\\\\\nRORY: This is the puzzle connected to the red note. Each note clues a location in the game. You go there and get the next note. Repeat. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> read red note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re told to go to the left elbow of Blue Fever\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s brother. If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll recall, Blue Fever is mentioned on the plaque underneath the statue on Mindo Street. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n \\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> x left elbow\\\\\\\\n> take violet note\\\\\\\\n> read violet note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: We saw forms in the bank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> search forms for x1-fsb\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The treasure hunt involves a couple of uses of \"search X for Y\".\\\\\\\\nRORY: This is about two hundred commands too late, but if you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tried \"ABOUT\" by now, it points you to\"ABOUT VERBS\", which lists some verbs you might not otherwise think to try. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take green note\\\\\\\\n> read green note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: There is only one place in town that contains pans of meat. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice the note doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t specify which kind of meat is the favorite, but there are only three options. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Also, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the pork pan, to save you two commands. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> look under pork pan\\\\\\\\n> take yellow note\\\\\\\\n> read yellow note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: I am sorry to say that the only purpose the Exploding Cockroaches serve in this game is to point you back to Mel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s via this note. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, this was a missed opportunity. One of the script editors said there were plans for a big bug race, but, you know, budget issues...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> search trinkets for cedar\\\\\\\\n> take cedar\\\\\\\\n> open cedar\\\\\\\\n> take ring\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re bad people. \\\\\\\\nRORY: It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in a pile of things in a store. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s to say someone completely innocent didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t buy it by accident? Also, yeah, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re bad people. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give ring to mel \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Might as well get rid of the ring, since we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re right here. \\\\\\\\nRORY: We actually talked about this at the cast party and we decided that Mel is totally on to you and just doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t care. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Well, Mel is _actually_ good at magic. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to happen to him? Maybe he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to turn a couple of guards into toads or something. \\\\\\\\nRORY: All right. Time for the last two simple puzzles. Conveniently, they both involve the same location. Off to rob the bank. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s funnier if we do it in the other order. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hm. Good point. Okay, Puzzle 3: Two-Handed Bart.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re back in the bank lobby. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x poster\\\\\\\\n> x man\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: W.D. thinks the guy looks a little like Two-Handed Bart. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s _not_ Two-Handed Bart, but that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s irrelevant. \\\\\\\\nRORY: The poster describes Bart. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s got shiny hair, a handlebar mustache, and a green scarf. Our man has a hat on, a wispy mustache, and no scarf. So we need to fix that. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x scarf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hm. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s yellow. Wrong color. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x dye\\\\\\\\n> dye scarf\\\\\\\\n> give scarf to man\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Okay. One down. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s got the wrong kind of mustache, but we can fix this. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x mustache\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: ... W.D. may interrupt you here. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x mustache\\\\\\\\n> wind mustache\\\\\\\\n> wind mustache\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: You may have to wind it more or fewer times to get it into the right shape. You want the handlebar mustache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give mustache to man\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re nearly done, but we have to get rid of the hat. Disambiguation here - you can refer to his hat as \"fedora\" and skip the \"do you \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nmean the unhat or the hat or the fedora or the ordinary man\" ridiculousness that you get sometimes. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take fedora\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: He won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t let us take the hat. This is okay, though, because we have the essence of anti-hat. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put unhat on man\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Okay, now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re good. We just have to summon the guard ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> pull cord\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we need to collect the reward. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w \\\\\\\\n> w \\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> show poster to guard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: More treasure for us! And now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the right place to start robbing the bank. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x evidence \\\\\\\\n> look in crack\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can see there are now more things in the evidence cabinet. Who knows where Two-Handed Bart has gone? \\\\\\\\nRORY: All right. We need to blow open this cabinet. Where have we seen explosions before? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> get salt\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Darn you, Mendolyn! All right, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve gotten more salt from Sandie. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wave wand\\\\\\\\n> get faery\\\\\\\\n> put faery in crack\\\\\\\\n> put salt in crack\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now in some sense this is Failure #3, because the door stays on, but it alerts the guard, which is good enough. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Come on, man, wake up. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> z \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now we have one turn to grab things. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> get scrap from cabinet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can duplicate these steps and try to grab the device, but we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not going to do that here, because it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually work. The device is too bulky and the guard will notice you. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s another way to get the device, which we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll talk about in the next section. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I dropped that thing on my claws at least twice. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, it was an authentically heavy prop. No cardboard boulders for us. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Oy. Anyway, what the heck does this scrap even say? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x scrap\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, some bozo tried to rob the bank! \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hey, look! A note! We don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to speak People if we have a _note_!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, Rory, do you like crime? \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hell yeah, I like me some crime. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s robbinate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now, as you may recall from the previous puzzle, _there is an alarm system_. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> break cord\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: But I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m awesome, so whatever. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> e \\\\\\\\n> show scrap to teller\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And now W.D. is the King of Moneyville. Good job. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 4: THE HARD PUZZLES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Technically, you can win the game now; four puzzles is the minimum necessary. You can skip down to Part 5 if you want that. But now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time for the good stuff. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Puzzle 5: Robbing the Blind involves several parts and requires doing a timed event correctly. \\\\\\\\nRORY: So we have this blind beggar in Big Street, South. He can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t see you but he can hear you. So you need to make a really loud distraction so that you can steal the coin without him noticing. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now, there is a place in the game that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very loud. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the one place in the game where \"listen\" does something special. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> w \\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> listen\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: As W.D. says, the stock market is a zoo. Somewhat ... literally, I guess. These animals would be _really loud_ if we could get them to the beggar. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We have a bunch of barely controlled animals, and we need to get them from Point A to Point Not A. We need to startle them, and then nature will take its course. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Its chaotic, chaotic course. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Right. Everybody loves a stampede. So we need a loud noise to startle the animals. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hey, wait, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to send them on the wrong track. You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t use the coin-and-salt trick here. The coin isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually loud. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just bright. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ah, yes. You want less \"explode\" and more \"pop\". \\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going for the balloon, if that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not clear. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: But you also shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t try to pop the balloon yourself. Standing in front of a stampede when it starts isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t very safe. (Feel free to try it and then \"undo\", if you like.) \\\\\\\\nRORY: Now, you need someone _else_ to pop the balloon for you. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Someone who might pop the balloon accidentally. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Right. Someone kind of ... pointy.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! \\\\\\\\nRORY: ... \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> ask hedgehog about stampede\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, asking the hedgehog about a stampede won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really work. You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually get a word in edgewise with the hedghog. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I think you mean _hedgewise_, amirite amirite? \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Did you get an Irish coffee, by any chance? \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hey, it was funny!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Reader, I know this is text, but I promise you I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m glaring at Rory. Anyhoo, no matter what you try to say to the hedgehog, he just \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nobsessively asks for food and tells you how pointy he is. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> hedgehog, go east\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t give him orders. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> show balloon to hedgehog\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: But he _does_ like toys. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to give him the balloon right away, because he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be completely engrossed once he gets it. So let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go drop the balloon where we need it, and then come back. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> nw\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> ne\\\\\\\\n> drop balloon\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: All right. The hedgehog won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do anything we want. I guess we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re forced to _listen_ to him. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s feed him. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> wave rod\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: You may recall that the fishing rod creates insects. Hedgehogs are insectivores, if you didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know. You can also give him fish, but the fish are a pain to get. As soon as you wave the fishing rod, the hedghog will snarf the bait. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> nw\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll follow you. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to keep feeding him every few turns to keep him following you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> wave rod\\\\\\\\n> ne\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve dragged the hedgehog to the stock market. He will start playing with the balloon. Now you need to book it to Big Street, South. The hedgehog will pop the balloon in a random but low number of turns. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: From here, wait until the stampede actually hits this location...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You may need more or fewer than three turns.\\\\\\\\nRORY: Then grab the coin!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> get strange\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Yoink!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: If you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to try to time your waiting, you can also just type \"get strange\" repeatedly and when it works, it works. \\\\\\\\nRORY: The kid who plays the hedgehog was eight, in case you were wondering. So the screechy singing is authentic. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: He was a good kid. He was just really boisterous. \\\\\\\\nRORY: And we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d like to point out that no actual animals were harmed in this. Just fake ones. We hear that our hedgehog actor went back to school and has been excitedly telling everyone that he got flattened by a cow in his first acting job.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time for Puzzle 6: The Mysterious Device.\\\\\\\\nRORY: If this phrase means anything to you, this is Speculative Fiction\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s version of the Babelfish puzzle. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The puzzle has a lot of steps and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s easy to break things at any step, so be prepared to restart it a lot.\\\\\\\\nRORY: You shouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to undo or restore save games. But you might find it easier to \"undo\" than to run back to grab items again. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: First, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s grab the device. We know from an earlier puzzle that you can drop a faery coin and some salt into the crack in the evidence cabinet, and that will cause a guard to open the cabinet for a turn. But the device is big and bulky, and the guard will stop you from taking it. \\\\\\\\nRORY: So we need to get the device \"legitimately.\" We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been carrying around this vellum page which is some kind of requisition form for the device. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> show vellum to guard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The guard isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t impressed. And he tears up our form. That jerk! Frederick tried this trick a lot, though, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just get another one. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> look in wastebasket\\\\\\\\n> take vellum\\\\\\\\n> read vellum\\\\\\\\n> x signature\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The major problem here is the signature. Even W.D. knows it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bad forgery. Even the idiot downstairs knows it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bad forgery. We gotta do better than this. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s start over.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x clear\\\\\\\\n> pour clear on signature\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we have an unsigned sheet of paper, and a very sleepy civil servant with a stamp. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> u\\\\\\\\n> put vellum on stack\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> take vellum\\\\\\\\n> read vellum\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s better. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an official stamp! Who can disagree with an official stamp?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> d\\\\\\\\n> give vellum to guard\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: I feel like many problems in this world were caused by the city guards not caring. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Nononoo. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re looking at it wrong. Many problems are _solved_ by the city guards not caring. Besides, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that one guard from the ransom job. He knows it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not really Two-Handed Bart. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Maybe Bill and him will team up in the sequel or something. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Speculative Fiction 2: This Time It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Personal.\\\\\\\\nRORY: Yeah, so we have this device. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x device\\\\\\\\n> x tray\\\\\\\\n> push green button\\\\\\\\n> push blue button\\\\\\\\n> push red button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Oooh, oooh, maybe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an instruction manual...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take pamphlet\\\\\\\\n> read pamphlet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Er, well ... kind of. So the device needs:\\\\\\\\n   1.) Some wool\\\\\\\\n   2.) A bottle of blue dye, in the bottle\\\\\\\\n   3.) An unbroken egg\\\\\\\\nYou put objects in the tray and press the blue button to load them. Then you press the green button to get money. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Well, we have wool. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put wool on tray\\\\\\\\n> push blue button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And we have blue dye. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put blue dye on tray\\\\\\\\n> push blue button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now we just need an egg! This puzzle is easy!\\\\\\\\nRORY AND MARTIN: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, as you may recall, W.D. is basically a black hole when it comes to eggs. So we have to somehow get an egg into this machine without W.D. being able to eat it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go back to the egg dispenser. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We already know he immediately eats the egg. Maybe we can put the egg into a container? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put vase in basket\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, the egg breaks, which isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t useful. However, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll notice W.D. can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get the egg while it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s inside the vase, which is useful. \\\\\\\\nRORY: The machine won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t accept a broken egg, so let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get rid of it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> break vase\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> take vase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: The vase is magic. It reappears five turns after it disappears, so you can \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Maaaaaybe we can cushion it? \\\\\\\\nRORY: What do we have that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s soft? We just used up the blanket bit. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And the whole blanket wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t fit anyway. Hey, you know what was soft? That scarf we gave to Two-Handed Bart. \\\\\\\\nRORY: But Two-Handed Bart got disappeared! \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: But his stuff ended up in the evidence locker. \\\\\\\\nRORY: So ... back to the salt mines?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> take salt\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> wave wand\\\\\\\\n> take faery\\\\\\\\n> put faery in crack\\\\\\\\n> put salt in crack\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n> get scarf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Phew. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m tired just reading that. \\\\\\\\nRORY: But we have the scarf!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put scarf in vase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Note that the scarf is still sticking out a little. So if you are doing this puzzle before the ransom puzzle, you can get it back out. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The vase is notable in that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \"very narrow\". W.D. can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get his head in there. \\\\\\\\nRORY: And once there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an egg in there, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be too blinded by its holy egginess to think of tipping the vase over. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re forgetting your own lines, Rory. W.D. tries to tip over the vase but the egg gets stuck. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Grrr. I resent the implication that birds are this stupid.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hey, I spend the whole game lying on a stone floor. \\\\\\\\nRORY: What about the endgame? \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, okay, two minutes of glory. ANYWAY...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Back in the Pantry.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put vase in basket\\\\\\\\n> pull lever\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now we have a vase with an egg in it, and W.D. can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get at the egg. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: But there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be a problem at the other end. We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to take the egg out of the vase and then W.D. will eat it. \\\\\\\\nRORY: So we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to keep him from getting at the egg a different way. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: To get the egg initially, we had to put it into a container. To get rid of the egg, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to put W.D. in a ... container.\\\\\\\\nRORY: Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go back to the device. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take vase\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> nw\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n> take device\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The device is too heavy for W.D. to carry. But he can push it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> drop device\\\\\\\\n> push device s\\\\\\\\n> push device w\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This has got to make an extremely strange sight for any passerby. \"Hm, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bird pushing a metal box and frantically trying to stick its head in a vase.\" \\\\\\\\nRORY: I really hope I get cast in a dramatic role someday. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take scarf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to remove the scarf from the vase or else the device will reject the egg. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> put vase on tray\\\\\\\\n> get device\\\\\\\\n> enter circle\\\\\\\\n> drop device\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll also need to remove the vase from the egg. W.D. is ::grumble:: apparently too \"bird-brained\" to think of this one himself. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Note the timing here. You have to take the fish the turn before you free the egg, or else W.D. will have time to eat it. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> take fish\\\\\\\\n> break vase\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Sproing! Now W.D. can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reach the egg, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'cause he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in the cage. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> push blue button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Of course, W.D. also can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t reach the button that will get rid of the egg...\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ha ha, but Frederick the wizard, tool-using mammal, will save the day!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> push blue button with wand\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now the egg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s gone and you can get W.D. out of the cage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n> break cage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: At some point, the vase will reform itself. Surprise. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s magic. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> push green button\\\\\\\\n> take counterfeit\\\\\\\\n> exit circle\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Regardless of what the machine says, Mel will accept this money. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: In theory we could go get another egg and another bottle of dye, but the blanket represents the only wool in the entire kingdom, so we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done here. \\\\\\\\nRORY: We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re ready for the last of the pre-endgame puzzles. Puzzle 7: Playing the Stock Market.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: This is a two-stage puzzle. In the first stage, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to crack the mystery of the merchants and successfully buy a stock. In the second stage, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to artificially inflate the price of the stock you just bought. \\\\\\\\nRORY: It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s now finally time to deal with the merchants. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n> ne\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The merchants are immune to stampedes, by the way. A wizard did it. \\\\\\\\nRORY: But not you. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re incompetent. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Mel probably did it. \\\\\\\\nRORY: If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t already examined the merchants...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x merchants\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: ... will cause W.D. to assign them names. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to be able to disambiguate them. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Here we have eight merchants, and an auctioneer selling stock in various animals. If you wait for enough turns, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see that different stocks sell for different amounts of money. Every bid doubles the price of a stock. Bidding starts at one florin. You have one florin. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Each merchant cares about a different attribute. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to figure out what each merchant likes and dislikes, and then pick a stock which no merchant wants. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be able to buy that stock for a single florin. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The auctioneer randomly selects animals, but will never select the animal that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the puzzle solution. You can, however, suggest stocks to him with \"search coffer for \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\". \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> search coffer for dog\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: You may have to enter this command a couple of times; the auctioneer only takes suggestions right as one auction is ending. \"dog\" isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t the answer, by the way; it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just an example.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can bid via \"buy certificate with florin\", but any other merchant can outbid you. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> buy certificate with florin\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: If you examine the individual merchants, you can get a vague hint as to what they like. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x rupertina\\\\\\\\n> x sunshine\\\\\\\\n> x fnyrx\\\\\\\\n> x elspeth\\\\\\\\n> x percival\\\\\\\\n> x demonspoon\\\\\\\\n> x rombert\\\\\\\\n> x hortensia\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Also as another hint, two of the merchants care about the attributes of the animals themselves. The other six care about attributes of the _names_ of the animals. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: So this is mostly a word puzzle. \\\\\\\\nRORY: For the record, we didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know about any of this ourselves. The writers gave us a list.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: There are some _hilarious_ outtakes of the merchants trying to remember their lines. \\\\\\\\nRORY: \"One!\" \"Four!\" \"Six! No, wait, three! Wait, do I even like cows?\" \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The crew laughed for a good five minutes. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s up, home fries? \\\\\\\\nRORY: Alessandra?! You came! \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I thought you were filming!\\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: We had to wrap early. Fatal bug - turned out you could \"take\" the dragon. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ooooh. Classic blunder. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Hey, now that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re hee, want to read the merchant list? \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: Uh, sure. Lessee...\\\\\\\\n   One only likes land animals (including amphibians)\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals with legs\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals who don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any doubled letters in their names\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals with five or fewer letters in their names\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals with nine or greater letters in their names\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals with an even number of letters in their names\\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals whose names cannot be beheaded to form a new word. \"So crow is bad because if you take off the c you get row, but dog is good because if you take off the d you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get a word.\" \\\\\\\\n   One only likes animals whose names cannot have their third letter changed to form a new word. \"So dog is bad because you can change the g and get dot, but snake is good because snike or snoke or whatever aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t words.\" \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   ... What? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Thanks, Alessandra. \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: Was this from the stock puzzle? I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really see it because I spent the whole time in Big Street, Center. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah. I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really see it either. I just heard about it later. \\\\\\\\nRORY: We should give them the actual answer. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Right. Alessandra? \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: Okay, wait, I lost my place ... Ah. You know from the two lengths that you want an animal whose name is between six and eight letters. From the even merchant, you know you want a seven letter name. From the land animal and leg animal merchants, you know you want a sea creature. You also know it must have a doubled letter, that it must form a new word if you change the third letter, and that the last six letters must spell a word. The answer is herring. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Okay, knowing all that, you still have to enter the right commands: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> search coffer for herring\\\\\\\\n> give florin to auctioneer\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: I think we may have said this before, but you can only suggest a stock right as one auction is ending, so you might have to time the \\\\\\\\n\"search coffer for herring\" command right. Nothing bad happens if you try it at the wrong time; it just doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Ta-da! Now you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done part one of the puzzle. \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: That was part ONE?\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Well, in some sense that was part 2. Part 1 was getting the florin, although that isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t too hard. \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: Clearly I missed a lot by staying in the meats stall. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve bought your share of Consolidated Herring Securities, the merchants go off to have coffee and the auctioneer sets up a stock ticker. Now you get to play with another mysterious device. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Right. The stock certificate you have now isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t worth anything. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to hack the ticker to convince the auctioneer that it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nvaluable, and then sell it back to him. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n> x ticker\\\\\\\\n> push red button\\\\\\\\n> push yellow button\\\\\\\\n> z \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Pushing the red button spits out some mysterious text, and pushing the yellow button causes the stock ticker to start displaying stock \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nvalues. If you wait a few turns, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see it rotates through the same five stocks. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x panel\\\\\\\\n> open panel  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Inside the device you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find six colored wires and six places you can plug those wires in. \\\\\\\\nALESSANDRA: I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m getting a headache. Goodnight, guys. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Aw. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Any time, Alessandra. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Again, aw. All right. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s finish this puzzle. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> disconnect black wossname\\\\\\\\n> z\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: You can see the stock ticker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s display has changed. If you push the red button again: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> push red button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: You can see that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s changed too. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: The wires somehow connect the incoming stock data to the external display. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Where the \"incoming stock data\" is coming in through magic or something. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> disconnect brown wossname\\\\\\\\n> connect black wossname to brown receptacle\\\\\\\\n> connect brown wossname to black receptacle\\\\\\\\n> push red button\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can see the ordering of the alphabet has changed. So now the input data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been warped and the ticker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s displaying a different set of stocks. \\\\\\\\nRORY: According to the notes which the writers gave us, the device is using a six bit input - each of the letters and numbers corresponds to a six-bit number. By swapping the wires around, you change what letters and numbers the device displays. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can keep changing wires and checking the red button until you get the alphabet in an order you like. But here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the answer: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> disconnect black wossname\\\\\\\\n> disconnect brown wossname\\\\\\\\n> disconnect red wossname\\\\\\\\n> disconnect orange wossname\\\\\\\\n> disconnect yellow wossname\\\\\\\\n> connect orange wossname to yellow receptacle\\\\\\\\n> connect yellow wossname to orange receptacle\\\\\\\\n> connect black wossname to red receptacle\\\\\\\\n> connect brown wossname to black receptacle\\\\\\\\n> connect red wossname to brown receptacle\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can leave the green wossname - er, wire - in place. \\\\\\\\nRORY: At this point the ticker will tell you that CHS (Consolidated Herring Securities) is up 37, um, units. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give certificate to auctioneer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And ... that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the seven main-game puzzles. \\\\\\\\nRORY: LET\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S TAKE THIS TRAIN TO THE ENDGAME.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 5: THE ENDGAME\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Okay, so there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s one and a half endgames. First we have to give all the ingredients to Mel and go make the potion. This part is not timed. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> sw\\\\\\\\n> s\\\\\\\\n> e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Back to Mel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give sovereign to mel\\\\\\\\n> give sack to mel\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Once you give Mel four treasures, which will be now if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re following the walkthrough, Mel will unlock a secret trapdoor in the floor. This will let you go down to the \"sekkrit laboratory\" and make the potion. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Mel unlocks the trapdoor at four treasures because that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the minimum you need to make a potion which won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get you killed. So you can stop at four or keep going for more points. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We, of course, want more points. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> give banknote to mel \\\\\\\\n> give reward money to mel\\\\\\\\n> give strange coin to mel\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Make sure to check the recipes before you start buying things. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> buy all ingredients\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: If you haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t solved all seven potions, you can do \"buy \\\\\\', \\\\\\'\" with a specific name. The page you got from the alchemy bench will give you the list of options. Or \"buy ingredient\" will _also_ give you the list of options. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll save our game and go downstairs. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m specifically suggesting saving now because you can get different endings depending on which potion you make. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> save\\\\\\\\n> whatever pick a save name\\\\\\\\n> d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: And now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the secret laboratory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x sign\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Did we mention to save your game? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x pot\\\\\\\\n> x liquid\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Here we have the potion-o-matic. Now. Do NOT add anything to the pot that is not part of one of the potion recipes.

NOT ANOTHER CUT SCENE!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: And now we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re at the \"real\" endgame. This part is timed. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll only need three turns to finish, though.\\\\\\\\nRORY: Now, if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have a valid potion, you are going to die. I hope you saved when we told you to. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: We start at the bottom of the tower. The treasurer will take a few turns to get the lift started. W.D. can just fly up. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> u\\\\\\\\n> n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: Everything in the vault is a mess. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> x logs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: These are the logs which Frederick the wizard put here so that the Perfectly Foolproof Illusion could have some objects to work on. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Now, you have two options. One, you could: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> pour potion on logs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: ... and watch that ending. Or, you could \"z\" until W.D. says \"Uh oh. They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re here.\" Then...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> pour potion on treasurer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Obviously, the latter option only works if you have the full Midas potion. \\\\\\\\nRORY: You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get a winning ending with \"pour potion on logs\" for any potion that required at least four ingredients. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPART 6: CRAZY ACTIONS YOU SHOULD DO SO SOMEONE SEES ALL OF THIS TEXT DEAR GOD WE INTENDED FOR THIS GAME TO BE SHORT\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Once you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve won, you should check \"AMUSING\" for some random fun things you can do in the game. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRORY: My personal recommendation is that you put the costuming parts on \"Two-Handed Bart\" one at a time and pull the cord after each one. You can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually make that puzzle unwinnable, so the guards get more and more ridiculous as you summon them over and over. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: I also like trying to go back to the barn after you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve burned it down. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Try having W.D. drink the potion as soon as you make it. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Oh, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a good one. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll run through all the puzzles you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve solved, complaining about each one. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Try popping the balloon in the stock market if you want to watch me die. ::sniff:: You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not that cruel, right? Also, if you wait while the hedgehog plays with the balloon, you can see him try to befriend it.\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Oh, oh! Goofy endings. I think the five-ingredient potion is pretty exciting. \\\\\\\\nRORY: SO MANY EXTRAS. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Yeah, that was exciting to film. Also, if you do have the full Midas potion, you could try pouring it on the other people in the room. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I find the \"pour potion on guard\" ending pretty funny for W.D. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: You can also get killed by going to the endgame and just waiting until the treasurer has you executed. That ending kills Frederick but not W.D. Or you can do \"pour potion on wizard\" if you hate us. \\\\\\\\nRORY: I guess in some sense that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the ending we deserve for all the havoc we wreak, but come on man, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s funny!\\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Hm, random things to try. Oh, if you break the alarm cord and then wait around, a workman comes and repairs it. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s actually a cameo by our Executive Producer. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Oh, and W.D.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s girlfriend does not actually appear in the game, if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re wondering. \\\\\\\\nMARTIN: Well, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve finished my coffee (thanks again, Rory!) and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve finished the game, so I think that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time to call it a day. \\\\\\\\nRORY: Yeah! Thanks again for playing! We hope to see you in another game!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\']\\'b\\'[\\\\\\'Supernova Walkthrough  (Apogee Software)\\\\\\\\nBy Ramon Bartschat (bartschat@goldnet.sk)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI will only describe the shortest way. \\\\\\\\nAnd I will omit many details. There are many more rooms and objects you should explore on your own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn between the described steps you will have to eat, drink and sleep.\\\\\\\\n-Sleeping can be done in your hotel room bed or spaceship bed.\\\\\\\\n-You can drink your beer and then refill the mug at a water tap at either your room or your spaceships bathroom. You can also drink directly from the water tap.\\\\\\\\n-You can only eat the food from the old storehouse; careful it is for a limited amount of times.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSTART\\\\\\\\n- Buy a beer, sit at the middle table, wait for the aliens to sit down and then \"listen carefully\" to all they have to say, write down the coordinates they mention.\\\\\\\\n(Notice that the holster in your room is of no use in the game, also the rusty key is only needed to open your hotel room, nothing else)\\\\\\\\n- Go outside to the old storehouse and get the satchel with food (you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the satchel, just the food)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(SPECIAL CHEAT\\\\\\\\n- Go W on the Dusty Road until you \"notice something unusual\" then type ENTER or IN\\\\\\\\nThis will take you directly to the ice planet with all the items you need and you will not be hungry, thirsty or sleepy)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWITHOUT CHEAT\\\\\\\\n- Go to your spaceship\\\\\\\\n- Go to the cockpit, place the cushion on the seat and sit down.\\\\\\\\n- To make it past security you have to provide the same \"identity code name\" you defined at beginning the game\\\\\\\\n- Fly to the coordinates you overheard from the aliens in the bar (R2/20-8-23 D2/VEGA)\\\\\\\\n- Initiate the countdown and rush for your cryo tube\\\\\\\\n- Keep trying to land (pushing the button) until you do so.\\\\\\\\n- Get out of your spaceship and head for the pyramid. Careful to \"jump stream\" to avoid the acid stream.\\\\\\\\n- When you get stung by the animal return to your spaceships laboratory and get serum number 6 (Poisons/Venoms). Put the empty mug in the niche for the serum. The serum dispenser will work only 2 times but you will not need it any more, only this one time.\\\\\\\\n- Get the cushion you will need it in the pyramid\\\\\\\\n- Return now all the way to the pyramid.\\\\\\\\n- Open the mouth of the dog, take the jewel and open the pyramid door with it.\\\\\\\\n- Get down to the skeleton room; get the grey disk (you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the skull)\\\\\\\\n- Go to the mini-pyramid room; touch the pyramid to open the secret passage. \\\\\\\\n- Enter the secret room and get the dusty ball, clean the ball, throw the ball at the wall to extract the shiny key (Should the secret door close then \"turn podium\" to open it again or just leave the room before it closes)\\\\\\\\n- Go to the mirror room. In the mirror room go NW-S-SE-E-NE-W-SE and then DOWN. (You might have to try several times until you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bump into a wall any more)\\\\\\\\n- Drop all you have except the cushion and the shiny key (You will need to carry a heavy rod later)\\\\\\\\n- Head for the other mini-pyramid room\\\\\\\\n- Put the cushion on the floor, put the shiny key in the keyhole, catch the crystal (wait a little for a secret room to open)\\\\\\\\n- Get back to the round room and take the rod\\\\\\\\n- CRAWL NORTH, JUMP GAP, PUT ROD IN RECESS\\\\\\\\n- Go and take all the items you left before. \\\\\\\\n- Go back through the mirror room NW-E-SE-S-NW-SE and UP  (again you might have to try several times to go in a certain direction until you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bump into a wall)\\\\\\\\n- Go back to where the big climbable tree is. A new way heading SW will be available now.\\\\\\\\n- Follow the SW track and enter the Antenna Building  (From now on, when you find things to read, read them backwards - SDRAWKCAB)\\\\\\\\n- Go to the transport booth and push the button\\\\\\\\n- Go find the robot in the Reactor Control room, \"open panel\" and get the plastic card\\\\\\\\n- Open the closed door with the plastic card, enter and get the suit\\\\\\\\n- Go to the transport boot and push the purple button to get the goggles, push the cyan button to go to the ice planet. Use the tan button to get back to the planet with your spaceship (to refill water or to sleep for example)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nON THE ICE PLANET (in reality a giant planet size spaceship)\\\\\\\\n- Enter the building and put the grey disk in the slot\\\\\\\\n- DROP ALL! If not you will loose all when the robot comes. You will find the grey disk here again, you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need it.\\\\\\\\n- Wait for the robot to zap you and then get all your possessions again.\\\\\\\\n- Wear the suit and go out to the circular corridor\\\\\\\\n- Go to the Transmission room and turn off the alarm (this is not a necessary step though)\\\\\\\\n- Go to the Maintenance room, find and get the gloves (you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need the \"device\" found there)\\\\\\\\n- Go to the closed door -the one with the picture of a cryogenic tube- and open it with the plastic card\\\\\\\\n- Enter to the Emergency Override room and Hit the cryo tube with the mug to free the scientist\\\\\\\\n- Either wait for the scientist here or follow him (you will end up in the same room again anyhow; following him gives you a clue where to check which crystal is damaged)\\\\\\\\n- Give him the clear crystal\\\\\\\\n- Wait to hear all his instructions\\\\\\\\n- Head for the elevator and go to the level the scientist mentioned you (480)\\\\\\\\n- Now is the time to wear the goggles (to cross the catwalk) and the gloves (to touch the crystals)\\\\\\\\n- Exit the elevator and head for the Reactor Regulator room where the panel with the crystals is \\\\\\\\n- The robot in Security Tunnel Number 3 will shoot you, you cannot avoid it.\\\\\\\\n- Open the panel and get the blue crystal\\\\\\\\n- Place your clear crystal in the socket\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat is about it.\\\\\\\\nRemember, there are many more rooms and objects you should investigate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n18.05.2000 by Ramon Bartschat

Before resorting\\\\\\\\nto the walkthrough, you may want to get as far in the game as\\\\\\\\npossible, using those hints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis file is a little discursive, including some actions which are\\\\\\\\nnot necessary to complete the game.  However, they should make the\\\\\\\\nexperience more enjoyable.  The exact phrases you will need to type\\\\\\\\ninto the interpreter are in ALL CAPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis walkthrough is based on Release 2 / Serial number 020130 / Inform\\\\\\\\nv6.15 Library 6/2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE CABIN\\\\\\\\n---------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re on vacation in Germany, with your wife and daughters.  And (to\\\\\\\\nquote the game) \"as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you\\\\\\\\nfind that your family is gone...\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou begin in the bedroom.  If you examine all the furniture (X BED, LOOK\\\\\\\\nUNDER BED, LOOK AT TABLE, etc.), you will find out more about what kind\\\\\\\\nof people you and your family are.  But the only thing you really need to\\\\\\\\ndo here is OPEN CLOSET, and then SEARCH CLOTHES (GET CLOTHES will also\\\\\\\\nwork).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(On the second turn you will hear something passing overhead.  Remember\\\\\\\\nthis!)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSW will take you to the living room.  Again, looking at all the things\\\\\\\\nmentioned in the room description will add to your knowledge of your family\\\\\\\\n(X RUG, X FIREPLACE, X SOFA, LOOK UNDER SOFA).  (If you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve played Zork, try\\\\\\\\ntyping MOVE RUG.)  Play around with things, and make sure to X TABLE.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nsee a tiny piece of paper.  X PAPER (READ PAPER would also work).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAha, so that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s where they are.  And you now have a tentative mission: drive\\\\\\\\nto town to go shopping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can go NW to the kitchen if you like; X TILES is kind of intriguing, and\\\\\\\\nyou could GET GAME and PLAY GAME for a while.  But it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really get you\\\\\\\\nanywhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(Hmmm... where do these people go to the bathroom?  I guess it isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nimportant.  :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the living room, S takes you outside--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cold, so you should WEAR\\\\\\\\nSWEATER.  You could walk S to the road and try walking S again--okay, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nneed the car.  Go back N to the driveway.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be gone for a while; better CLOSE FRONT DOOR.  ENTER CAR, CLOSE CAR\\\\\\\\nDOOR, and TURN ON THE CAR.  Ick, the stereo!  (Try LISTEN TO STEREO for a\\\\\\\\ngood time... not.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDRIVE SOUTH (or just S would work) twice and --\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUh-oh.  (So *that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s* what passed overhead on the second turn of the game.)\\\\\\\\nHere it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to notice: the sphere is beta radiant (dangerous to\\\\\\\\nexpose yourself to it for long periods of time); it will kill everyone\\\\\\\\nin the vicinity (including you and your unwitting family); you have to\\\\\\\\ngo get the sphere from the center and bring it back here to the aliens.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour car is off now, so TURN ON ENGINE, and you can see that a smaller\\\\\\\\nroad leads WEST, so follow it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOUT gets you out of the car (automatically turning off the engine).  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCABLE CAR TERMINAL AREA\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may want to explore a bit: NORTH then DOWN takes you to an iron\\\\\\\\ndoor, which you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t open (at least not yet... but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s good to know\\\\\\\\nthat it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s there).  UP then SOUTH takes you back to the parking lot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(SOUTHWEST takes you to a garage, but you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to go here.  It\\\\\\\\njust gives you another option for the next puzzle.  From the garage,\\\\\\\\nEAST goes back to the parking area.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom there NORTHWEST and WEST gets to the actual Cable Car Terminal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see a trunk; OPEN it, GET all the contents (the bag and wrench).\\\\\\\\nThen CLOSE TRUNK.  (I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know if it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s necessary, but listen:\\\\\\\\nsomeone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s hanging around and whistling, and you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want them to know\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re here.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou want to get across the wire.  There are three ways (at least) to do\\\\\\\\nit.  I did it the hard way, so here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s that one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour goal is to get the guy who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s whistling to ferry you over.  To do\\\\\\\\nthat, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to hide on the roof of the car.  But once he comes into\\\\\\\\nthe room, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to already be hidden.  So prepare the car:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nENTER CAR. UP. OPEN HATCH. DOWN. EXIT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you can lure the guy out:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKNOCK ON DOOR. ENTER CAR. U. U.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWAIT twice and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see the service man come out of his door.  He\\\\\\\\nlooks around for you and can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find you (I wonder why?).  He decides\\\\\\\\nto leave anyway.  WAIT three more times and you will be at...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHE CENTER\\\\\\\\n----------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nor more specifically at the Upper Cable Car Terminal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you try to get on the floor, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no way to avoid being seen.\\\\\\\\nInstead STAND ON WIRE and WAIT five times for the man to leave with\\\\\\\\nthe car.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be afraid: type DOWN and you will land safely every time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPursuing your goal to pick up everything that isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t nailed down (a\\\\\\\\nusual strategy for adventure games), you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to OPEN CHEST, GET\\\\\\\\neverything from it (chain and cutters), and CLOSE CHEST.  Again, it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nprobably not necessary to close it, but I worry that someone will\\\\\\\\ndiscover your theft if you leave it open.  Anyway, that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s everything\\\\\\\\nto do in this room, so go NORTH and face the receptionist.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen she asks if you speak english, type WOMAN, YES to answer her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen she asks for your name.  Fortunately she\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s willing to wait a while.\\\\\\\\nTo figure out who you are (or who you want to pretend to be), try\\\\\\\\nexamining everything in sight.  Specifically, X BOX (or X DESK gives\\\\\\\\nyou the same description).  Hey, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a tag in there, maybe it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s for\\\\\\\\nyou.  X TAG.  Then tell the woman what she wants to hear:  WOMAN, HANS\\\\\\\\nLEIBACH.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou will get that name tag (which you should wear throughout the center),\\\\\\\\nand the head of the center, Williams, shows up, and says to come see him.\\\\\\\\nBut you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to do that yet; there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a puzzle in his office you\\\\\\\\ncan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t solve yet, until you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve explored a little.  While you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re here,\\\\\\\\nX LIST to tell you everyone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s names, and ASK HENKEL (the receptionist)\\\\\\\\nabout all of them.  She gives you especially useful information about John\\\\\\\\nand Stefan (namely, that Stefan is gone and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re replacing him, and that\\\\\\\\nJohn drinks).  Try ASK HENKEL ABOUT SPHERE to find out exactly which room\\\\\\\\nthe thing is in.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore entering the center itself, you may want to begin making a map.\\\\\\\\nThis walkthrough will tell you how to get from place to place, but exploring\\\\\\\\non your own can be fun too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo NORTH into the center.  To get the objects you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need for the puzzle\\\\\\\\nin Williams\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' office, go WEST three times (into the kitchen).  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need\\\\\\\\npretty much everything here.  GET KETTLE.  Then you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to hunt around\\\\\\\\nin the drawers and fridge.  OPEN UPPER DRAWER. GET GLASS.  OPEN LOWER\\\\\\\\nDRAWER.  GET KNIFE AND BOTTLE.  OPEN FRIDGE.  GET MEAT.  (X STOVE and\\\\\\\\nX WALLPAPER will get amusing messages, though it isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really necessary.\\\\\\\\nOther messages include X MICROWAVE and USE MICROWAVE (a reference to\\\\\\\\nLurking Horror in that one).)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(SOUTH and X CHAIRS gets you another amusing message.  I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find\\\\\\\\nanything else to do in the dining room.  NORTH gets you back to the kitchen.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re in the neighborhood, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s get some more items that will\\\\\\\\ncome in handy.  Go EAST twice from the kitchen, then SOUTH into the bathroom.\\\\\\\\nGET SOAP.  See that fusevault?  Although it is \"high up on the eastern wall\",\\\\\\\\nyou can OPEN it.  Then GET CANDLE AND LIGHTER.  CLOSE FUSEVAULT (you may have\\\\\\\\nnoticed by now that I have a \"thing\" about closing doors).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING STEFAN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\\\\\n---------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince this is a walkthrough, we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to do things in a slightly\\\\\\\\ndifferent order than if you were just playing straight through.  You\\\\\\\\nalready know (because you talked with Henkel) that Stefan is gone, so\\\\\\\\nhis office is empty.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a useful item in there.  To get there,\\\\\\\\nhead NORTH from the bathroom, EAST three times and then NORTH two more\\\\\\\\ntimes.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be outside his office.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry going EAST--the door is locked.  X DOOR.  You can see the bolt in\\\\\\\\nthe chink...  If there were just some way to lift the bolt.  Well, there\\\\\\\\nis.  PUT KNIFE IN CHINK.  OPEN DOOR and GO EAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst things first: X everything you can see.  X CHAIR doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t give you\\\\\\\\nmuch that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s interesting.  X COMPUTER won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t help; if you try to login, it\\\\\\\\ntells you to talk with Ms. Henkel about it; and if you ASK HENKEL ABOUT\\\\\\\\nLOGIN at some point, she tells you she hasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t had time to set yours up.\\\\\\\\nBut it *is* possible to log into the computer, if you know some passwords\\\\\\\\nfrom other games.  Meanwhile, X DESK and X BASKET.  Aha, something\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s there.\\\\\\\\nGET PAPER and READ IT.  You may want to write down the code that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s there.\\\\\\\\nIt changes every game, so be sure to keep track of your saved games.  Soon\\\\\\\\nwe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll find out what the code is used for.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRight now, in fact.  Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go check out Schwartz.  If you asked Henkel\\\\\\\\nabout him, you didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t find out much; in fact, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the head of security\\\\\\\\nfor the center.  To get to his office, go WEST once, SOUTH twice, WEST\\\\\\\\nonce, and SOUTH into the office.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a security officer, Schwartz is remarkably unparanoid.  Just\\\\\\\\nX everything in his office with him sitting there, and he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even\\\\\\\\ncare.  Especially X DESK and X LIST.  Then, you can even GET LIST right\\\\\\\\nfrom under his nose.  The list tells you that there are four codes, and\\\\\\\\nthat everyone in the center has one.  Except you.  ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT\\\\\\\\nCODE.  He just tells you to talk to Henkel, and we already know where\\\\\\\\n*that* got us.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT SPHERE, although he isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t very helpful.  But you can\\\\\\\\nsee where it is: X VIDEO MONITOR.  Naturally, the one place you want to\\\\\\\\nbe is the one place he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s watching every second of the day.  X RECORDER\\\\\\\\nand try to play with the buttons--nope, not while he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s here.  At least\\\\\\\\nhe prevents you from doing *something* in his office.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING JOHN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\\\\\n-------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done enough here.  Finally we can go talk to Dr. Williams.  Go\\\\\\\\nNORTH once and EAST twice to his office.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you WAIT a turn, he tells you that he wants to propose a toast, but\\\\\\\\nhas no glass for you to drink out of.  GIVE GLASS TO WILLIAMS.  (You\\\\\\\\ndon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t actually need to wait a turn; if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t, you really confuse\\\\\\\\nthe heck out of Williams--he probably thinks you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re psychic or something.)  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen Williams starts looking around in his desk.  WAIT twice, and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nleave to get your forms.  Now you must spring into action--your goal is\\\\\\\\nto get *all* of his whisky.  Fortunately you brought a bunch of\\\\\\\\ncontainers with you.  Furthermore, you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want him to know that\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve stolen the whisky, so you have to fool him somehow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be specific, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to leave the brown bottle full of tea when\\\\\\\\nyou walk out of here.  So GET KETTLE.  GET BROWN BOTTLE.  GET GREEN\\\\\\\\nBOTTLE. (so you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have any awkward moments where the parser tells\\\\\\\\nyou \"You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re not holding that\")  POUR WHISKY INTO GREEN BOTTLE.  POUR\\\\\\\\nTEA INTO BROWN BOTTLE.  PUT BROWN BOTTLE ON DESK.  Finally, PUT ALL\\\\\\\\nIN BAG (so Williams won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t realize what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done).  Then you just\\\\\\\\nhave to WAIT (four times) and Williams will return, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll sign the\\\\\\\\npaper, and then you can GET GLASS and go WEST to leave.  (I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not sure\\\\\\\\nyou need the glass for anything, but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just good practice to pick up\\\\\\\\nanything you can.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may as well READ DOCUMENT too; it tells you three things.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) Schwartz is the security guy (but you knew that anyway)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) The castle area is off-limits (not that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll pay any attention\\\\\\\\n   to that, will you?) and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3) You need all four codes to get into the security lab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWell, all that whisky has to come in useful somehow, so let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go get\\\\\\\\nJohn to talk to us.  The people wander around randomly, so you have\\\\\\\\nto go find John wherever he is.  I usually wait for him in the library\\\\\\\\nor in his office.  Once you and he are in the same room, GIVE GREEN BOTTLE\\\\\\\\nTO JOHN.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHe drags you to his office and gets very drunk.  Now is your chance:\\\\\\\\nASK JOHN ABOUT CODE.  Again, remember the number--write it down\\\\\\\\nsomewhere, since it changes every game.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING WILLIAMS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' CODE (with some unrelated activity)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo now what?  Well, since this is a walkthrough, I know that you need\\\\\\\\nsomething in the basement.  To get there, leave John\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s office by going\\\\\\\\nWEST, go NORTH twice, WEST twice, SOUTH twice, and WEST once again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou want to go through the door to the south, but you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t because it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nlocked.  Go ahead, X DOOR--notice the \"door closer\"?  X CLOSER.  Try OPEN\\\\\\\\nDOOR (no good).  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll just have to wait for someone else to go through.\\\\\\\\nIn particular wait for a message like \"Petra puts a key in the lock...\\\\\\\\nand walks south\" (when I play, it always seems to be Petra), then X DOOR\\\\\\\\nagain (notice the description of the bolt... any ideas?).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you block the bolt, the door can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t lock.  So PUT SOAP IN BOLT.  Some\\\\\\\\nof it is sticking out--that won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work, Petra will notice.  CUT SOAP.\\\\\\\\nNow wait for Petra to leave.  Then go SOUTH and GET PADLOCK.  You can\\\\\\\\nX EQUIPMENT, but it isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t important.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re going to head outside.  To get there, go NORTH out of the\\\\\\\\nstorage room, then EAST, NORTH twice, EAST, and NORTH twice again.\\\\\\\\nYou will be in the yard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKeep going: NORTH, WEST, NORTH into the toolshed.  Only two things to\\\\\\\\nlook at here: X BENCH (although it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s rather pointless) and X SCOOTER\\\\\\\\n(notice the hook).  You need the scooter, and you need it someplace\\\\\\\\nelse.  TURN ON SCOOTER and ENTER IT.  Then go SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH,\\\\\\\\nSOUTHEAST, SOUTHEAST and GET OFF SCOOTER and TURN IT OFF.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nneed to go inside the poultry house mentioned here by going NORTHWEST\\\\\\\\nand EAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere the interesting object is the grating.  X GRATING, then go ahead\\\\\\\\nand try OPEN GRATING.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need some leverage here.  Specifically,\\\\\\\\nTIE CHAIN TO GRATING--this wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have worked without the padlock.\\\\\\\\nThen GET CHAIN and PUT CHAIN IN WINDOW (you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even have to open\\\\\\\\nthe window--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s broken).  Back to the scooter by going WEST and SOUTHEAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis tripped me up a bunch of times: you have to ATTACH CHAIN TO HOOK.\\\\\\\\n(Do not just type \"put chain on hook\", because that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work,\\\\\\\\nalthough it sounded to me as though it did.  Anyway, use the \"attach\"\\\\\\\\nsyntax, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be fine.)  Then PUSH SCOOTER.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go see what you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve wrought: NORTHWEST and EAST to get inside\\\\\\\\nthe poultry house, then DOWN into the hole and SOUTH.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX DOOR (it should look familiar from way back at the beginning of\\\\\\\\nthe game) and X HANDLE.  You can try TURN HANDLE, but it won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do\\\\\\\\nyou any good.  You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have what you need, yet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s our next task.  NORTH, UP, WEST, and NORTHWEST takes you to\\\\\\\\nthe center of the yard.  Continue NORTH, EAST, NORTHEAST, and\\\\\\\\nNORTH... we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re getting close to the castle that you were warned\\\\\\\\nagainst!  READ SIGN to remind you of that very thing.  Well, tough.\\\\\\\\nGo on to the NORTH.  (X CASTLE if you want.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou have two choices.  To begin with, go NORTHWEST.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a\\\\\\\\nuseful item: a ladder.  GET LADDER.  Now go back to the SOUTHEAST\\\\\\\\nand try the other passage to the NORTHEAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIgnore the western door for now and go NORTH to the bottom of the\\\\\\\\nstaircase.  (X STAIRCASE if you like.)  Go on UP to the top of the\\\\\\\\nstaircase and follow the exit SOUTHWEST (X HOLES for a little\\\\\\\\natmosphere), then WEST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis room is a bit complicated.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to X everything in\\\\\\\\nsight again.  X SHELVES and X CUPBOARD.  Hmm... you can see all the\\\\\\\\nshelves except one.  Guess what you need to do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPUT LADDER AGAINST SHELVES.  CLIMB LADDER.  Hey--X IRON KETTLE\\\\\\\\n(you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to keep calling it \"iron kettle\" to distinguish it\\\\\\\\nfrom the clay kettle, unless you drop the clay kettle somewhere).\\\\\\\\nGET that KETTLE.  Then you can go DOWN off the ladder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time to deal with the cupboard.  Play around a bit before\\\\\\\\nyou read the next part--in particular, play around until you die\\\\\\\\na few times!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOPEN CUPBOARD.  Hey, X those UNIFORMS.  (Try to GET UNIFORMS for\\\\\\\\nan amusing message.)  Well, even though the uniforms are in there,\\\\\\\\nthere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s still room for you, so ENTER CUPBOARD.  Now X CUPBOARD\\\\\\\\nagain.  The message is a bit different inside here.  Keep on\\\\\\\\nexamining stuff.  X WALL tells you about a crack, and X CRACK tells\\\\\\\\nyou about a metal plate.  X DOOR also tells you a little about the\\\\\\\\nplate.  You can open the rear wall, but I wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do that yet.\\\\\\\\n(Okay, you can try it, but save your game first.)  So how could you\\\\\\\\ndo that safely?  All that stuff about the plates means that only\\\\\\\\none door can be open at a time: either the door you came through,\\\\\\\\nor the rear wall.  So first you must CLOSE DOOR, then you can\\\\\\\\nOPEN REAR WALL.  Go on out to the NORTH.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUh-oh, a bomb!  First things first: X BOMB.  Looks like the bomb\\\\\\\\nwon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go off on its own, so you have time to go ahead and X CORD,\\\\\\\\nX WIRE, and X STRAP too.  Fortunately, way back near the\\\\\\\\nbeginning of the game, you picked up some wire cutters.  So CUT\\\\\\\\nRED WIRE WITH CUTTERS, and then CUT CORD WITH CUTTERS.  Yes, the\\\\\\\\norder is important.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s done, X CUPBOARD once again.  It looks different\\\\\\\\nfrom this angle--X PROTRUSION for a little more info, and then\\\\\\\\nX BAR for still more detail.  Might as well try to GET BAR.  It\\\\\\\\ndoesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work, but you can GET BAR again and it *does* work this\\\\\\\\ntime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all you need on this side of the cupboard, so SOUTH goes\\\\\\\\nback inside, OPEN DOOR (since you disabled the bomb, you can do\\\\\\\\nthis without fear), SOUTH to get out of the cupboard, and don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nforget to GET LADDER before you leave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemember that doorway to the west that we ignored?  Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go back\\\\\\\\nthere.  EAST, NORTHEAST, DOWN, then SOUTH.  Now we can go through\\\\\\\\nthat doorway to the WEST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInteresting.  X HOLE, LOOK IN HOLE, and try going DOWN.  No good.\\\\\\\\nFortunately, you brought a helpful item.  PUT LADDER IN HOLE.  Try\\\\\\\\ngoing DOWN now--*still* no good.  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s true you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need the kettle\\\\\\\\nlater, but you can leave it here for now: DROP IRON KETTLE.  Then try\\\\\\\\nDOWN (the third time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the charm).  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s pretty clear the only way to go from here: WEST, and then NORTH.\\\\\\\\nYou can X FIREPLACE and X CHIMNEY, and then go on EAST.  Here you could\\\\\\\\nX WOOD, X SHAFT, and X BASKET.  Something about this shaft reminds me\\\\\\\\nof other games I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve played--you can bet you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll be using it before\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re through.  For the moment, GET WOOD and go back WEST.  PUT THE\\\\\\\\nWOOD IN THE FIREPLACE.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe game told you earlier that something was blocking the chimney.\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go find out what it is.  If you try to ENTER THE FIREPLACE,\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re told that you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do it with the metal bar, so DROP BAR\\\\\\\\nand then ENTER FIREPLACE.  If you LOOK, you will see bird\\\\\\\\ndroppings... Go on UP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAha, the source of the droppings.  X NEST and X KEY.  Go ahead and\\\\\\\\nGET KEY.  That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all you have to do here, so go DOWN and OUT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may have noticed a mention in passing about the soot, while you\\\\\\\\nwere climbing.  X ME to see the effects of the soot.  This wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nseem like a problem, but if you go back to the center this way, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll\\\\\\\\nknow where you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been, and remember: the castle is forbidden, so\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll get in trouble.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got to remove the soot first.  (For\\\\\\\\nan amusing message, save the game and go back the way you are.)\\\\\\\\nThere are apparently at least two different ways to clean yourself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat we have to do is melt some snow, and use that to wash off the\\\\\\\\nsoot.  What to use for a container?  The iron kettle would be nice...\\\\\\\\nWe could melt it over the fire...  But we can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bring it down the\\\\\\\\nladder normally.  There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s another way to get it down, though.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s go get the kettle.  Go SOUTH, EAST, and UP to where you\\\\\\\\nleft it, and GET IRON KETTLE.  Now to get it downstairs.  Go EAST,\\\\\\\\nSOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, and NORTH.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t been in here before.  You can X FIREPLACE and X SHAFT.\\\\\\\\nI bet you know where the other end of that shaft it.  TURN WHEEL.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOops, you need some snow in the kettle before you get it downstairs.\\\\\\\\nGo SOUTH; the snow has been blowing around a lot, or else there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a\\\\\\\\nhole in the ceiling, because there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s some snow here.  So FILL IRON\\\\\\\\nKETTLE WITH SNOW.  Then go back NORTH.  PUT IRON KETTLE IN BASKET.\\\\\\\\nYou can see you aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t the first one to think of this.  TURN WHEEL\\\\\\\\nto send it back downstairs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s follow it.  Go SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, WEST, DOWN,\\\\\\\\nWEST, NORTH, and finally EAST.  Whew!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo turn the snow into water, GET IRON KETTLE and take it to the\\\\\\\\nWEST.  PUT IRON KETTLE ON WOOD and make a fire: LIGHT WOOD WITH\\\\\\\\nLIGHTER.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to wait about ten turns until the wood is\\\\\\\\nconsumed by the fire and you get the message \"The kettle is not as\\\\\\\\nhot anymore\".  Then the water will be bearable.  GET IRON KETTLE\\\\\\\\nonce more and WASH ME.  (You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to specify \"with water\" or\\\\\\\\nanything like that.)  X ME to verify that the soot is gone.  And\\\\\\\\nyou may as well GET BAR--you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll need it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done downstairs, and in fact we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re done with the castle.  Go\\\\\\\\nSOUTH, EAST, and UP.  (Notice that you can bring the iron kettle up\\\\\\\\nthis way, just not down.  Hmm...)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo on ahead out of the castle area: EAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, SOUTH,\\\\\\\\nWEST, and WEST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s time to enter the long building by going SOUTHWEST.\\\\\\\\nThere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only one door you can get to at this point.  Go SOUTH and\\\\\\\\nSOUTHWEST into the Hall, and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll hear a voice from the WEST.  Go\\\\\\\\nthere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProbably it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no surprise who you find here--who else would say\\\\\\\\n\"Polly wanna cracker\"?  Go ahead and X PARROT, X PACKET, X BRANCH, and\\\\\\\\nX WINDOW.  Wait around a few turns if you want, to hear the parrot say\\\\\\\\namusing things.  I found references to Zork, Pink Floyd\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s The Wall,\\\\\\\\nHitchhiker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, and some things I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nunderstand.  When you get bored with that, GET PACKET.  Finally, you\\\\\\\\ncan see that this parrot repeats everything it hears, so try to ASK\\\\\\\\nPARROT ABOUT CODE.  Yep, it works.  Remember the number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING PETRA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'S CODE\\\\\\\\n--------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne more to go.  And it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s also in this building, although you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get\\\\\\\\nthere from here.  From the parrot\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room, go EAST three times, then NORTH,\\\\\\\\nWEST, and SOUTHWEST.  You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve gone all the way around the building.  X SOFA,\\\\\\\\nX DOOR, and finally X WINDOW.  Uh-oh, that doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t look promising, but you\\\\\\\\nhave to try.  Go ahead and OPEN WINDOW, and go EAST to get inside.  The dog\\\\\\\\nmight not like you, but he didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t stop you from entering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, you have something that might distract him, that you picked up way\\\\\\\\nback in the kitchen early on.  X MEAT.  We want to get the dog outside,\\\\\\\\nso THROW MEAT THROUGH WINDOW.  The dog is *almost* outside, but he just\\\\\\\\nneeds a little help... PUSH DOG and he will be outside.  Quickly, go EAST\\\\\\\\nbefore he gets back in--you only have one turn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this room you can X CLOSET and OPEN IT.  X COVERALLS, GET THEM, and\\\\\\\\nWEAR THEM.  Now you can face the dog with a little protection.  Go back\\\\\\\\nWEST and X DOG.  That necklace looks interesting.  X NECKLACE.  X BOX.\\\\\\\\nOPEN BOX and GET NOTE.  READ THE NOTE and remember the number--it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the\\\\\\\\nlast code!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGETTING INTO THE SECURITY LAB\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime to go input the codes.  We have to get one more item first, though.\\\\\\\\nGo WEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, and SOUTH to end up in front of a storage shed.\\\\\\\\nYou may as well DROP IRON KETTLE--you won\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need it again, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s from\\\\\\\\nthe castle, so it would get you in trouble to take it inside.  Then\\\\\\\\nUNLOCK SHED DOOR WITH KEY (the key you went to such pains to get in\\\\\\\\nthe castle) and OPEN SHED DOOR.  Go NORTHEAST to enter the shed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nX JUNK a few times for some amusing messages (including another\\\\\\\\nHitchhiker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Guide reference).  Then X SACK.  See how it protects\\\\\\\\nagainst biological waste?  Wonder if it would do any good against\\\\\\\\nradiation... like beta radiation... like the kind that the sphere gives\\\\\\\\noff.  Better GET SACK.  Then we can head inside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo SOUTH three times, then EAST and SOUTH again.  X SMOKE DETECTOR\\\\\\\\n(although it doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tell you much).  Our goal is to lure Schwartz out\\\\\\\\nof his office so we can fiddle with his security camera.  Save the game\\\\\\\\nhere, because the timing seems to matter in this section.  GET CIGARETTE\\\\\\\\nAND LIGHTER, then LIGHT CIGARETTE and DROP IT.  Whoa, you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want to be\\\\\\\\ncaught hanging around here.  Hightail it SOUTH, SOUTH again, WEST, and\\\\\\\\nSOUTH.  Schwartz will run into you on the way, going to turn off the\\\\\\\\nalarm, and he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll also scold you about smoking, but fortunately he doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\ndo anything more serious to you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s your chance--PRESS REWIND and then PRESS PLAY.  His cameras will\\\\\\\\nonly show old footage, rather than showing him you entering the door.\\\\\\\\n(If your score doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t go up by four points, the timing was wrong and\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll have to try again.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t think there was any great rush, but there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s no need to dawdle\\\\\\\\naround either.  Go NORTH and EAST.  Then go NORTH three times, WEST twice,\\\\\\\\nand SOUTH twice.  Finally, go EAST and you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll see the keypad.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you can type in all the codes you got: the one from the dog, the one\\\\\\\\nfrom Stefan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s office, the one from the parrot, and the one John told you.\\\\\\\\nYou can type them in any order.  Just TYPE XXX ON KEYPAD, with no quote\\\\\\\\nmarks.  After all four have been correctly entered, the door will open.\\\\\\\\nGo EAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWINNING THE GAME\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t a lot of time to waste, and besides you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need anything\\\\\\\\nelse in the room.  So just GET SPHERE and PUT IT IN SACK (to protect\\\\\\\\nyourself from radiation poisoning).  Now you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got to get out of here,\\\\\\\\nso go WEST twice, NORTH twice, EAST once, and NORTH twice again to get\\\\\\\\nto the Yard outside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSOUTHEAST, EAST, DOWN, and SOUTH brings you to that familiar-looking door.\\\\\\\\nOnly, now you can open it.  That bar you have will fit over the handle.\\\\\\\\nI tried some weird phrasing here, but OPEN DOOR WITH BAR is all you need.\\\\\\\\nGo on out to the SOUTH.  (X SCOOTER and TURN ON SCOOTER for some amusing\\\\\\\\nmessages.)  By now you should recognize your surroundings--go UP twice and\\\\\\\\nyou\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re way back at the parking lot.  It should be pretty simple from here...\\\\\\\\nThe aliens wanted you to bring the sphere back to the place where they\\\\\\\\nstopped your car.  So ENTER CAR, TURN ON ENGINE and go EAST.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCongratulations, you won!  If you followed this walkthrough, you should\\\\\\\\nhave 96 points.

A step-by-step\\\\\\\\nwalkthrough is provided at the end, but using it except as a last resort\\\\\\\\nwill spoil your fun.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, to become regent you\\\\\\'ll need to eliminate five rivals: War Minister\\\\\\\\nKlaus Wehrkeit, Christ Minister Pierre Bonfleche, Interior Minister Variola\\\\\\\\nModo, Coffers Minister Argento Rico, and Prince Louis. Don\\\\\\'t worry about\\\\\\\\nAmbassador to China Marco Pulisci (you can call China and find out he\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nalready dead).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWEHRKEIT\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWehrkeit is fighting the Venetians but soon learns of the king\\\\\\'s death and\\\\\\\\nretreats to Piedmont. If you do nothing, he will arrive around 3 o\\\\\\'clock\\\\\\\\nand kill you. When you ask Miss Sierra about Venice, she will give you a\\\\\\\\npiece of information that the Venetians might be interested in and which\\\\\\\\nmay threaten Wehrkeit\\\\\\'s position. You need to contact Venice via the\\\\\\\\ntelephone in the throne room. For some money, Miss Sierra will also give\\\\\\\\nyou the necessary telephone codes. But you have to ask her in time, because\\\\\\\\nat some point Rico will bribe Sierra to give you a false access code which\\\\\\\\ntriggers a booby trap.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWehrkeit will still arrive and may still kill you if you run into him and\\\\\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t react quickly. But he\\\\\\'s badly injured, and you can either kill him or\\\\\\\\njust keep away from him and wait till you get the news of his death.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBONFLECHE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBonfleche is tutoring Prince Charles until he gets the news of the king\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\ndeath. Soon afterward he leaves for Avignon and organizes an invasion of\\\\\\\\nPiedmont by Avignese forces. He must be killed while he\\\\\\'s still in the\\\\\\\\npalace. If you use the spying equipment in your quarters to monitor\\\\\\\\nBonfleche\\\\\\'s quarters, you can witness some extremely unseemly conduct on\\\\\\\\nhis part at 2 o\\\\\\'clock. Record it with your master key and show it to Miss\\\\\\\\nSierra. She\\\\\\'ll take care of him.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMODO\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModo is doing experiments with green slime in an underground lab. To get to\\\\\\\\nhim, you need the vials from his quarters. You don\\\\\\'t want to go in there,\\\\\\\\nbut with a hostile tone you can order the guard in. Then tell him to get\\\\\\\\nthe vials. You also the need the gas mask from the royal quarters. Now go\\\\\\\\nto the fountain in the courtyard. Put the yellow liquid and then the pink\\\\\\\\nliquid in the funnel. Push the loose tile, use the gas mask, and go\\\\\\\\ndown. You\\\\\\'ll find Modo there. Kill him before he kills you. Don\\\\\\'t forget to\\\\\\\\npull the cord to prevent the spread of the green haze.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRICO\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRico is in his quarters most of the time. If you talk to Princess Charlotte\\\\\\\\nin the palace asylum, she will tell you about the unseemly things he\\\\\\'s done\\\\\\\\nto her. Unfasten her straitjacket and she will follow you. Go to Rico and\\\\\\\\ngive her the dagger from your quarters. (She would dispatch of Louis and\\\\\\\\nBonfleche in the same way, but once she has killed one, she will be taken\\\\\\\\naway. Since you have other ways to eliminate Louis and Bonfleche, it\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nadvisable to have her kill Rico.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOUIS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLouis sits in the courtyard all the time. There are two balconies above the\\\\\\\\ncourtyard. Prince Charles is playing with a heavy toy car in the royal\\\\\\\\nquarters. But before you can do the obvious, you have to get the car from\\\\\\\\nthe prince. You have to give him something else so that he lets you take\\\\\\\\nthe car. Among Rico\\\\\\'s junk is a nice toy robot. Get it while Rico is out of\\\\\\\\nhis room.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe timing is most critical in this game.

Oddly enough \\\\\\\\nthe idea for the Wade War series came to me as a teenager, working \\\\\\\\nin a pizza parlor during the mid to late 80\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.  Today, filed deep \\\\\\\\nin my filing cabinet under \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCreative Works\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I have twelve-year-old \\\\\\\\nscraps of paper and napkins upon which are scribbled most of the \\\\\\\\ntext for the currently non-existent Book One, which takes place \\\\\\\\nalmost entirely within the pizza parlor from which it was conceived.\\\\\\\\nIf I remember correctly, there once existed a portion of BASIC \\\\\\\\nsource code for Wade War I  (WWI) written to run under TRS-DOS \\\\\\\\non my TRS-80 model 1.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn my twenties, as I began to write games with the intention of \\\\\\\\ndistribution, I began to reassess the quality of my games.  Slowly,\\\\\\\\nit began to sink in that WWI was not of the caliber that I truly \\\\\\\\nwanted to be known for.  The game simply contained too many \\\\\\\\ninside jokes.  Events and characters within the game were familiar only \\\\\\\\nto a small group of people, most of whom did not even own a computer.  \\\\\\\\nVery few would fully be able to appreciate the tale of my war against \\\\\\\\nWade.  Something geared for a broader audience, a sequel, began to \\\\\\\\nform in my mind.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, I have always been one to bite off more than I could \\\\\\\\nchew.  True to my nature, I designed the second game to be monstrous \\\\\\\\nin size.  It was to be something that had never been seen before.  \\\\\\\\nSurprisingly enough, if I were to complete it today, I suspect that this \\\\\\\\nwould still be the case.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  Regardless, the story \\\\\\\\nnever saw a line of code before the third book in the Wade Wars came \\\\\\\\nupon me.  For reasons I do not fully understand, book three came to me \\\\\\\\nalmost in its entirety.  Like some strange epiphany it came in a flash.  \\\\\\\\nI envisioned in a moment, the entire story.  I saw the references to \\\\\\\\nthe previous books, the storyline, the puzzles, the ending and a basis \\\\\\\\nfor a fourth book.  It came to me so completely and took a form that \\\\\\\\nstood so well by itself that it preempted work upon any previous \\\\\\\\neffort.  WadeWar3 was my singular focus for some time.  It existed \\\\\\\\nonce, but no longer, on the TRS-80 model 1, as well as the \\\\\\\\nCommodore 64.  In 1993, I released the PC/DOS version to SDN, the \\\\\\\\nShareware Distribution Network, under the company name \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFish \\\\\\\\nSoftware\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d.  After a time, my interest waned.   Registration mailboxes \\\\\\\\nwere closed, source code was lost, and the game, or so I believed, was \\\\\\\\nforgotten.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlmost a decade later, in the summer of 2000 I stumbled upon it again \\\\\\\\non GMD (search engines facilitate things like that).  With a little \\\\\\\\nresearch, I discovered Inform, Frotz, and rediscovered Zork again.  The\\\\\\\\nold flame for the now dead Infocom games burned within once more.  With \\\\\\\\na little effort to learn Inform, a bit of code to extract the text from \\\\\\\\nthe original WWIII game and a few weeks in front of my terminal and I \\\\\\\\nhad produced a young, new version of the Wade Wars, book 3. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAre books 1 and 2 to come?  Maybe.  WWII has been in development for \\\\\\\\nquite some time now, but it is no where near completion as of yet.  Still, for \\\\\\\\nthose who are interested in seeing where I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going, there is a work in progress \\\\\\\\nthat can be found in the downloads section of OnyxRing.com.  Additionally,\\\\\\\\nthere are a few ties to the Wade Wars that can be found in other works that I \\\\\\\\nhave done, such as my entry in the Mark Musante\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Toaster Mini Comp \\\\\\\\n(\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot Toast?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d).  Still, the Wade Wars is around fifteen years old (if counting \\\\\\\\nfrom its conception)  There are oh so many other ideas which I may just spend\\\\\\\\nthe time to write.  Which brings us to this document.  Although the information \\\\\\\\ncontained herein should work fine for the DOS version as well, it is written with \\\\\\\\nthe z-code version of the game in mind.  I see no reason why there \\\\\\\\nwould be any difference, but just in case there is, this document \\\\\\\\ncovers z-code version of the game.  Any questions, suggestions, or just\\\\\\\\nplain correspondence should be sent to me at:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\tJim@OnyxRing.com.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd with that done, on with the walkthrough:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe point of WadeWar3 is fairly straightforward.  You are the nephew \\\\\\\\nof Simon Seamore, a somewhat eccentric scientist and inventor.  Uncle \\\\\\\\nSeamore, it seems, has disappeared, as he had before, and you feel \\\\\\\\ncompelled to locate him.  You begin in his apartment:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) Prologue \\\\\\\\n(In the Living Room of Uncle Seamore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apartment)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nRead book\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nPush red button\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotes:\\\\\\\\nA surprising number of players have written about confusion in the \\\\\\\\napartment.  For this reason, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve modified the journal description to try \\\\\\\\nand communicate the nature of the huge machine a little more clearly.  \\\\\\\\nI hope this helps players.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOf course if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re reading this, then you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re already looking for answers,\\\\\\\\nso I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just spell it out here:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis game, indeed the whole Wade War series, deals with alternate \\\\\\\\nrealities.  For this story, neighboring realities are \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ctied together\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d at \\\\\\\\ncertain locations.  Machines such as your uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invention, when used \\\\\\\\nfrom these places, push the user (in this case, you) halfway between \\\\\\\\nthe two realities for a few moments.  This halfway world spans the two\\\\\\\\nuniverses and at the end a three turns, you will be expelled from it and\\\\\\\\nplaced in one reality or the other.  If you are fairly close to the machine,\\\\\\\\nthe halfway world looks familiar enough (although backwards, as though\\\\\\\\nflipped around an axis, marked by your uncle with the yellow line).  There,\\\\\\\\nwhen three turns time is up, you will return to your uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apartment.  \\\\\\\\nThe further away from the machine you travel, the more differences you \\\\\\\\nwill begin to notice (like bark growing on the walls).  There are two locations \\\\\\\\nin the backwards world that are far enough from the machine to expel you to \\\\\\\\nthe neighboring world after three turns:  The backwards bathroom, or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMoorh \\\\\\\\nTab\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the backwards closet, or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTesolc.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  The Moorh Tab route has the \\\\\\\\nadvantage of being the direction your uncle took.  Follow this path and you \\\\\\\\nwill find your uncle almost immediately.  Of course, not being the first to \\\\\\\\ngo this way costs you that element of surprise needed to save your life.  At \\\\\\\\nthis point in the game, passage into Askin through the Tesolc is the only way\\\\\\\\nto go.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) Chapter 1\\\\\\\\n(At the base of the black tower)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nW\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nUNLOCK BOX WITH KEY\\\\\\\\nOPEN BOX\\\\\\\\nGET STONE \\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nS\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nE\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nN\\\\\\\\nPUT STONE IN INDENTATION\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotes\\\\\\\\nAt the completion of the above last step, all of your possessions become \\\\\\\\nunreachable (you trade places and inventories with the statue).  The game \\\\\\\\ncan be completed just fine without most of the obtainable objects in the \\\\\\\\ngame up until this point.  There is one notable exception, however.  The \\\\\\\\nphosphorous crystal (from the phosphorous cave) is needed to win.  If you \\\\\\\\nhave located and collected the crystal you must drop it before putting the \\\\\\\\nstone in the indentation.

The informative number (1357) is written on the scrape of paper formally held by the statue.

Could be the gloves.\\\\\\\\nH24j: Could you get a more accurate reading?\\\\\\\\nH24k: Think of how doctors measure body temperature.\\\\\\\\nH24l: Taste the thermometer.\\\\\\\\nH24m: Add 273 to the reading and set the temperature dial to that.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ25: Ruby still finds me!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH25a: If she mentions seeing blue, you didn\\\\\\'t set the wavelength dial correctly.\\\\\\\\nH25b: If she starts by saying you look hot, you didn\\\\\\'t set the temperature correctly.\\\\\\\\nH25c: Notice that Ruby goes to the dead woman.\\\\\\\\nH25d: There\\\\\\'s no way out of the biodome, which means you must be inside.\\\\\\\\nH25e: And the dead woman is obviously a scientist.\\\\\\\\nH25f: Her face is unrecognisable.\\\\\\\\nH25g: Ruby might mistake her for you if it wasn\\\\\\'t obvious.\\\\\\\\nH25h: Take the woman\\\\\\'s lab coat off her and take it with you into the locker.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ26: I\\\\\\'ve managed to hide from Ruby Eagle. How do I defeat her?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH26a: She won\\\\\\'t be fooled for long.\\\\\\\\nH26b: You need to surprise her, so step out of the locker straight away.\\\\\\\\nH26c: She\\\\\\'s got you in her sights again.\\\\\\\\nH26d: As long as she can see you, there\\\\\\'s nothing you can do.\\\\\\\\nH26e: Could you block her vision somehow?\\\\\\\\nH26f: With something large?\\\\\\\\nH26g: Throw the labcoat at her.\\\\\\\\nH26h: You have time for one action only.\\\\\\\\nH26i: Her armour protects her body.\\\\\\\\nH26j: But if you disarmed Ruby Eagle...\\\\\\\\nH26k: Grab the plasma rifle. That\\\\\\'ll take care of her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ27: Ruby\\\\\\'s dead but I\\\\\\'ve got no evidence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH27a: You\\\\\\'ve seen the evidence. That\\\\\\'s all that\\\\\\'s required.\\\\\\\\nH27b: If you haven\\\\\\'t found the evidence in the casino on level 29, go there.\\\\\\\\nH27c: Otherwise head to Utopia Studios on level 27. The gate is open now.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ28: How do I get back past the sentry cannons?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH28a: The crop duster can\\\\\\'t be accessed now.\\\\\\\\nH28b: But you have the means to permanently disable the cannons.\\\\\\\\nH28c: Use Ruby\\\\\\'s plasma rifle to shoot them.\\\\\\\\nH28d: Just don\\\\\\'t go carrying the weapon into the transporter ring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ29: Is there any point to visiting the biodome?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH29a: Physical evidence can\\\\\\'t be retrieved.\\\\\\\\nH29b: But you need to discover what\\\\\\'s going on to progress.\\\\\\\\nH29c: There\\\\\\'s something the biodome has that\\\\\\'ll be useful later on.\\\\\\\\nH29d: An adjustable light setting.\\\\\\\\nH29e: Something will show up in the right light.\\\\\\\\nH29f: You\\\\\\'ll know what when you\\\\\\'ve found the clue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 13 - FREE MARKET\\\\\\\\n----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: What\\\\\\'s the point of the swapshop?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: For swapping items, obviously.\\\\\\\\nH1b: It\\\\\\'s a one for one trade system.\\\\\\\\nH1c: You need to find something valuable to trade.\\\\\\\\nH1d: Many illegal items are valuable.\\\\\\\\nH1e: Such as cyberjacks or the morphtool.\\\\\\\\nH1f: And subbuteo pieces.\\\\\\\\nH1g: There are other things too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: Which item do I need from the swapshop?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Is there anything in particular you need?\\\\\\\\nH2b: Eventually you\\\\\\'ll need all three items.\\\\\\\\nH2c: But one is crucial immediately.\\\\\\\\nH2d: Have you listened to the homeless man?\\\\\\\\nH2e: Remember the interface port in the guidebot?\\\\\\\\nH2f: You need the octagonal headed cyberjack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What should I swap for the cyberjack?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: You don\\\\\\'t have many items.\\\\\\\\nH3b: The smuggler was bringing in the morphtool...\\\\\\\\nH3c: ...so it has value.\\\\\\\\nH3d: Unfortunately, you need it to open the robot\\\\\\'s access panel.\\\\\\\\nH3e: ...which you can only do in the apartment.\\\\\\\\nH3f: Try to leave and the robot closes the panel again.\\\\\\\\nH3g: You need both the morphtool and cyberjack...\\\\\\\\nH3h: ...so you need to find something valuable.\\\\\\\\nH3i: You can find that in the retirement home on level 20.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: What about the homeless man?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: What about him?\\\\\\\\nH4b: Have you listened to him?\\\\\\\\nH4c: What he says is crucial.\\\\\\\\nH4d: In particular the guidebot, Jack and the quotas.\\\\\\\\nH4e: Remember the numbers -- 500 credits and 8 hours.\\\\\\\\nH4f: You\\\\\\'ll need that information later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: I can\\\\\\'t find Jack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: If he\\\\\\'s a friend, he should be close by.\\\\\\\\nH5b: The man isn\\\\\\'t talking about a person.\\\\\\\\nH5c: Remember the interface port inside the droid\\\\\\'s panel?\\\\\\\\nH5d: The homeless man is telling you discreetly that you need something.\\\\\\\\nH5e: The octagonal headed cyberjack in the swapshop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: What about speaking Jack\\\\\\'s language?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: The man likes his cryptic riddles.\\\\\\\\nH6b: He\\\\\\'s referring to something you need to use cyberjacks.\\\\\\\\nH6c: You have a cashcard. Have you tried buying something from him?\\\\\\\\nH6d: You need to be more discreet. Listen to the man\\\\\\'s comments.\\\\\\\\nH6e: He keeps mentioning \\\\\\'money to burn\\\\\\'.\\\\\\\\nH6f: Put the cashcard in the barrel.\\\\\\\\nH6g: No good? The man doesn\\\\\\'t give nothing for free...\\\\\\\\nH6h: ...or a measly ten credits.\\\\\\\\nH6i: You need more money on your account.\\\\\\\\nH6j: You\\\\\\'ll need to work for it.\\\\\\\\nH6k: And you can\\\\\\'t reach the industrial levels.\\\\\\\\nH6l: But not everybody works in industry.\\\\\\\\nH6m: You can find a job on level 17, so go there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: I paid the homeless man, but he gave me nothing in return.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: He\\\\\\'s paranoid, remember?\\\\\\\\nH7b: He\\\\\\'ll leave the item for you.\\\\\\\\nH7c: In a very safe place.\\\\\\\\nH7d: He has ways of getting places normally restricted.\\\\\\\\nH7e: Did you hear what the man said?\\\\\\\\nH7f: Go home.

The questions are posted\\\\\\\\n      on the first square (across or down), and the letters go left to\\\\\\\\n      right (for across) or top to bottom (for down).

All the twos - that was a hint to come to the library.\\\\\\\\nH1f: Remember the other part? Look for Zacharias.\\\\\\\\nH1g: Ask the droid to find Zacharias - you\\\\\\'ll get a book.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: I keep dying when opening Zacharias\\\\\\' book. What do I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Try reading the cover.\\\\\\\\nH2b: Do you see anything important before you die?\\\\\\\\nH2c: The cover mentions time being critical - and it is.\\\\\\\\nH2d: You need to open the book at a certain time.\\\\\\\\nH2e: The message of level 16 is the clue here.\\\\\\\\nH2f: What time is all the twos?\\\\\\\\nH2g: Open the book at 22:22\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What are the yellow contact lenses for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: Have you read the description?\\\\\\\\nH3b: Have you focused on them to get Nanci\\\\\\'s verdict?\\\\\\\\nH3c: The lenses store retinal data and can be used to bypass a scanner.\\\\\\\\nH3d: They\\\\\\'re also illegal, so use the inhaler to transport them between levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: What about the second book?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: The second book becomes available much later.\\\\\\\\nH4b: If you\\\\\\'re not a purple (class one) citizen, you don\\\\\\'t need it yet.\\\\\\\\nH4c: If you haven\\\\\\'t found the message cube, don\\\\\\'t continue.\\\\\\\\nH4d: If you haven\\\\\\'t spoken to Old Bruce, do so.\\\\\\\\nH4e: He mentioned a name and a biography - follow up on it.\\\\\\\\nH4f: The second author is Wendi Miranda Donahue. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: What is the purpose of the reading room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: It should be self-explanatory.\\\\\\\\nH5b: Reading.

Until then, no.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: How do I get the Janie Rourke subbuteo piece out of the exhibit hall?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Have you tried taking the piece out?\\\\\\\\nH2b: The guard doesn\\\\\\'t seem that alert, does he?\\\\\\\\nH2c: But he can still hear the alarm, and see you with the piece.\\\\\\\\nH2d: He doesn\\\\\\'t have much regard for the alarm system, so you could confuse him.\\\\\\\\nH2e: Have you tried putting something on the pedestal?\\\\\\\\nH2f: It\\\\\\'ll need to be similar enough to fool the guard.\\\\\\\\nH2g: Only one item will work -- something that looks exactly the same.\\\\\\\\n     Another subbuteo piece, identical to Janie Rourke.\\\\\\\\nH2h: If you\\\\\\'ve far into the game and have found the UTN news article, you\\\\\\'ll know\\\\\\\\n     a key fact about two players. But you can make a guess anyway.\\\\\\\\nH2i: Janie Rourke has a twin sister named Tania.\\\\\\\\nH2j: Don\\\\\\'t carry on until you have the Tania Rourke piece. \\\\\\\\n     It\\\\\\'s somewhere in the school on level 21.\\\\\\\\nH2k: Put the Tania Rourke piece on the pedestal, hide the Janie piece, and you can leave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: I\\\\\\'ve got the subbuteo piece out of the hall, but can\\\\\\'t take it out of the museum.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: There\\\\\\'s no way to fool this guard...\\\\\\\\nH3b: ...which means you\\\\\\'ll have to deactivate the security.\\\\\\\\nH3c: You\\\\\\'ll need to get past the USF troops (see Q1).\\\\\\\\nH3d: Examining and having Nanci analyse the museum security will help.\\\\\\\\nH3e: You need to remove the radiation from the Janie piece so it won\\\\\\'t be detected.\\\\\\\\nH3f: And that means using the deradiator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: How do I work the deradiator?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: What deradiator? It\\\\\\'ll be obvious when you\\\\\\'ve find it.\\\\\\\\nH4b: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve gotten past the USF troops (see Q1).\\\\\\\\nH4c: Reading the instruction manual is always useful.\\\\\\\\n     Or in this case, the sign.\\\\\\\\nH4d: You need to know the donator and the year of donation.\\\\\\\\nH4e: Who\\\\\\'s been giving away subbuteo pieces recently?\\\\\\\\nH4f: If you\\\\\\'ve found the subbuteo table or message cube, you\\\\\\'ll know the answer.\\\\\\\\nH4g: Lucy Song was the donator, so the initials are LS.\\\\\\\\nH4h: She\\\\\\'s been giving the items away recently, so you can assume it\\\\\\'s the current year.\\\\\\\\nH4i: The year was mentioned on the terminal early on. And the calendar.\\\\\\\\nH4j: The current year is 2165.\\\\\\\\nH4k: Set the rings to LS2165, put the piece on the deradiator and activate it.\\\\\\\\nH4l: Now you should be able to safely remove it from the museum.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: What\\\\\\'s the purpose of the time capsule?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: It\\\\\\'s a ride, so get in.\\\\\\\\nH5b: It provides useful historical background...\\\\\\\\nH5c: ...and something very interesting in the last room (the archipelago).\\\\\\\\nH5d: If you haven\\\\\\'t helped the student in the cafeteria on level 25, you may\\\\\\\\n     not realise its significance.\\\\\\\\nH5e: The Arcology will do for one of his photos.\\\\\\\\nH5f: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t take photos from inside the time capsule.\\\\\\\\nH5g: See the hints for Q7 below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: How do I get through the emergency exit?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: If you\\\\\\'re on the wrong side you can\\\\\\'t open it.\\\\\\\\nH6b: It\\\\\\'s an exit so there must be an entrance.\\\\\\\\nH6c: You\\\\\\'ll be able to open it from the other side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: Is there any more I can do with the time capsule?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: There\\\\\\'s not much you can do from inside.\\\\\\\\nH7b: You need to get out. Is there a safe area to do that?\\\\\\\\nH7c: Try jumping into the water in San Francisco.\\\\\\\\nH7d: Ah, the safety harness...\\\\\\\\nH7e: You can\\\\\\'t unlock the harness when it\\\\\\'s closed.\\\\\\\\nH7f: So you need to prevent it locking in place.\\\\\\\\nH7g: Have you examined the harness?\\\\\\\\nH7h: If you could block the buckle...\\\\\\\\nH7i: Put something small in the buckle before you set off. You\\\\\\\\n     can get the item back later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: What should I do in San Francisco?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: There\\\\\\'s not much you can do from the air.\\\\\\\\nH8b: See the above hints if you want to escape the capsule.\\\\\\\\nH8c: There\\\\\\'s something new you can see from the water.\\\\\\\\nH8d: A vent in the west wall. You need to reach it, which involves\\\\\\\\n     solving a few problems first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ9: There\\\\\\'s not much to see in San Francisco.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH9a: There\\\\\\'s Coit Tower...\\\\\\\\nH9b: ...and the maglev rail. And the ocean.\\\\\\\\nH9c: Most of San Francisco is underwater.\\\\\\\\nH9d: Try diving. \\\\\\\\nH9e: That valve looks useful. Turn it to lower the water level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ10: I\\\\\\'ve found the bridge. What now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: You\\\\\\'re not here for sightseeing.\\\\\\\\nH11b: That cable could prove useful.\\\\\\\\nH11c: Do you care for Utopia or history?\\\\\\\\nH11d: Break the bridge to get a useful item.\\\\\\\\nH11e: That won\\\\\\'t help by itself.\\\\\\\\nH11f: And don\\\\\\'t stop there.\\\\\\\\nH11g: Break it again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ11: How do I reach the vent in the west wall?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH11a: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve lowered the water level.\\\\\\\\nH11b: And got two useful items.\\\\\\\\nH11c: Have you tried throwing the cable at the vent?\\\\\\\\nH11d: If you had something to tie the cable to, it might catch.\\\\\\\\nH11e: Like the support pillar.\\\\\\\\nH11f: Looks like that\\\\\\'s not the answer.\\\\\\\\nH11g: Is there something better to hook on to?\\\\\\\\nH11h: Try throwing the cable and pillar at the maglev rail.\\\\\\\\nH11i: Now you have a cable to climb.\\\\\\\\nH11j: Can\\\\\\'t reach it? How can you get closer?\\\\\\\\nH11k: Turn the water valve and try again.\\\\\\\\nH11l: You can\\\\\\'t go up... or west.\\\\\\\\nH11m: You need to gain some momentum. Is there anything around you\\\\\\\\n      could push off?\\\\\\\\nH11n: Kick Coit Tower and then go through the vent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ12: I keep on dying in the Colombian trenches!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH12a: Apparently Utopia used real poison gas.\\\\\\\\nH12b: Looking before you leap is a good idea.\\\\\\\\n      Try examining the soldiers and the trenches from the time capsule.\\\\\\\\nH12c: Or if you didn\\\\\\'t, have a good feel around.\\\\\\\\nH12d: The soldiers must have survived the gas somehow.\\\\\\\\nH12e: You\\\\\\'ll need to be specific when searching.\\\\\\\\nH12f: Feel their heads. Or take a gas mask if you know about it.\\\\\\\\nH12g: Now you can breathe down here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ13: How do I clear the smoke?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH13a: That\\\\\\'d be helpful wouldn\\\\\\'t it?\\\\\\\\nH13b: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t.\\\\\\\\nH13c: You can\\\\\\'t see a thing, so rely on your other senses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ14: Where do I go in the trenches?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH14a: Did you look at the trenches before jumping in?\\\\\\\\nH14b: It\\\\\\'s a bit of a maze, but a very small one.\\\\\\\\nH14c: The entrance is in the southeast, the exit in the northeast.\\\\\\\\nH14d: Move around and make a mental or written note where the walls are.\\\\\\\\nH14e: The maze is a five by five grid with no complications -- going \\\\\\\\n      west then east will get you back where you started etc.\\\\\\\\nH14f: You can only move in the major compass directions.\\\\\\\\nH14g: If you\\\\\\'re still stuck, go W W W N N E N N W W W from the entrance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ15: So what was the point of all that?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH14a: Reaching the Arcology, naturally.\\\\\\\\nH14b: And the other side of the fire exit. Now you can come back anytime.\\\\\\\\nH14c: Go help the student in the cafeteria on level 25 if you haven\\\\\\'t done so.\\\\\\\\nH14d: He needs a photo of the arcology for his portfolio.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 24 - HOLY CITADEL\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: What are the Tenets of Utopia for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: Reading.\\\\\\\\nH1b: Really.

There\\\\\\'s your opportunity.\\\\\\\\nH5f: Ducking won\\\\\\'t work, since you\\\\\\'ll still be in sight of the citizens.\\\\\\\\nH5g: Is there anything you could do while ducked you couldn\\\\\\'t before?\\\\\\\\nH5h: Take a look at what\\\\\\'s around? Any hiding places?\\\\\\\\nH5i: Hide under one of the pews.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: What\\\\\\'s the statue of the Director for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: For information and looking at what a great man he is.\\\\\\\\nH6b: Have you spoken to the student on level 25?\\\\\\\\nH6c: Have you helped him with his problem?\\\\\\\\nH6d: He needs a picture of the Director.\\\\\\\\nH6e: Unfortunately you can\\\\\\'t get it during the ceremony.\\\\\\\\nH6f: Concentrate on surviving then deal with this later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: The statue disappeared! How do I get it back?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: The statue only officially comes up during the ceremony.\\\\\\\\nH7b: Remember what the minister was doing before the statue raised?\\\\\\\\nH7c: Remember what he said? Focusing on the statue and Bible might help.\\\\\\\\nH7d: Cometh the year, cometh the day, cometh the moment.\\\\\\\\nH7e: Have you looked at the bible?\\\\\\\\nH7f: You need to turn it to three specific places.\\\\\\\\nH7g: The clues are on the door outside. If you need to get of the hall,\\\\\\\\n     check the appropriate hint below.\\\\\\\\nH7h: The Director was born on the extra day at a quarter to four in the\\\\\\\\n     afternoon in the year 1916.\\\\\\\\nH7i: Start with the year, so turn the bible to 19:16\\\\\\\\nH7j: What\\\\\\'s the extra day? It comes every four years.\\\\\\\\nH7k: You\\\\\\'ll need to enter it in American format, putting the month first.\\\\\\\\nH7l: In a leap year, the extra day is February 29th, so turn the bible \\\\\\\\n     to 2:29.\\\\\\\\nH7m: Then the moment. Use military time format.\\\\\\\\nH7n: The time is 15:45.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: What should I do with the minister?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: Nothing unless you want to.\\\\\\\\nH8b: He may be worth following.\\\\\\\\nH8c: You\\\\\\'ll need to hide in the room or leave before he goes to bed.\\\\\\\\nH8d: Hiding may give you an extra clue.\\\\\\\\nH8e: If you\\\\\\'re not carrying anything, you can get on the chandelier.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ9: How do I get the items on the collection plate?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH9a: Have you tried taking them?\\\\\\\\nH9b: You\\\\\\'ll need to deactivate the forcefield.\\\\\\\\nH9c: The stained glass window is the answer.\\\\\\\\nH9d: Do those women remind you of anybody? You\\\\\\'ve met at least one by now\\\\\\\\n     and heard of another.\\\\\\\\nH9e: The animals and colours are important.\\\\\\\\nH9f: There are six women, so you need to press six animals.\\\\\\\\nH9g: If you\\\\\\'re quick and hide, you can see the last animal the minister pushes.\\\\\\\\nH9h: This puzzle is easier to solve later when you know the executives better.\\\\\\\\nH9i: Some you won\\\\\\'t have met the first time you\\\\\\'re in the citadel, and you\\\\\\'ll \\\\\\\\n     get more opportunities to meet them later.\\\\\\\\nH9j: The women have distinctive features, so try to remember which one is which.\\\\\\\\nH9k: The first woman was the executive in the tetrahedron -- Ruby Eagle.\\\\\\\\nH9l: So start by pushing the red eagle.\\\\\\\\nH9m: From left to right, the women are Ruby Eagle, Jet Scorpion, Crystal Mole,\\\\\\\\n     Ivory Worm, Amber Bear and Pearl Crocodile.\\\\\\\\nH9n: The symbols you need to push are: red eagle, black scorpion, clear mole,\\\\\\\\n        white worm, orange bear and grey crocodile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ10: How do I get out of the citadel?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: You used the same solution to another problem.\\\\\\\\nH10b: If the citizens and minister return, they\\\\\\'ll see you.\\\\\\\\nH10c: Hide under a pew again.\\\\\\\\nH10d: You can come in and out as often as you need to, and\\\\\\\\n      don\\\\\\'t have to repeat the ceremony.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ11: I keep getting discovered by the minister!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH11a: Don\\\\\\'t let him see you.\\\\\\\\nH11b: See the hints to Q10 if you haven\\\\\\'t already.\\\\\\\\nH11c: If he notices something out of place, he\\\\\\'ll raise the alarm.\\\\\\\\nH11d: The Director\\\\\\'s statue is very large.

Have you seen something like it before?\\\\\\\\nH2f: It requires a cyberjack, but the one you have is no good.\\\\\\\\nH2g: Hanging around the student long enough might help.\\\\\\\\nH2h: He has the cyberjack, but it won\\\\\\'t work for him.\\\\\\\\nH2i: Ask the student for the circular headed cyberjack.\\\\\\\\nH2j: Well -- what are you waiting for? Jack in.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What should I do about the dragon?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: Have you tried defending yourself?\\\\\\\\nH3b: Looks like that\\\\\\'s not an option...\\\\\\\\nH3c: You can\\\\\\'t do anything about it the first time...\\\\\\\\nH3d: ...but you need to get rid of the problem.\\\\\\\\nH3e: Notice what the student says when you exit.\\\\\\\\nH3f: He\\\\\\'s interested in what happened.\\\\\\\\nH3g: So tell him about the dragon.\\\\\\\\nH3h: Next time you log on, you\\\\\\'ll be better equipped.\\\\\\\\nH3i: Try looking at your inventory in cyberspace.\\\\\\\\nH3j: It\\\\\\'s a throwing star, so throw it. Bye bye dragon.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: How do I unscramble the text?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: Have you tried reading the text?\\\\\\\\nH4b: Have you tried turning the spinners? Both of them?\\\\\\\\nH4c: They need to be set to specific letters.\\\\\\\\nH4d: Whenever you turn the white spinner, the text changes,\\\\\\\\n     replacing the yellow spinner letters in the text.\\\\\\\\nH4e: This is a standard substitution cipher, with each letter of the\\\\\\\\n     alphabet being replaced by another. If a letter occurs more than\\\\\\\\n     once, the substitution is the same each time.\\\\\\\\nH4f: Identifying likely words in the coded message helps.\\\\\\\\nH4g: Try talking to the student if you\\\\\\'re stuck. Ask him some questions.\\\\\\\\nH4h: Does he mention a name? A signature?\\\\\\\\nH4i: Ivory Worm. That\\\\\\'s at the end, so try changing the letters.\\\\\\\\n     With those in, a couple of more words can be guessed.\\\\\\\\nH4j: It\\\\\\'s common to try putting THE or YOU in the text for unknown\\\\\\\\n     three letter words, so try that.\\\\\\\\nH4k: Remember where you are, and who Ivory Worm is.\\\\\\\\nH4l: The text is: \\\\\\\\n     YOU CAN\\\\\\'T HIDE FROM THE EXECUTIVE OF CYBERSPACE -- IVORY WORM\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: I\\\\\\'ve unscrambled the data. What now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: The student seems pleased, but he\\\\\\'s got another problem.\\\\\\\\nH5b: He asked you a question.\\\\\\\\nH5c: Offer to help by saying yes. He\\\\\\'ll give you a task and\\\\\\\\n     something to help.\\\\\\\\nH5d: This is the only way of getting class two citizenship.\\\\\\\\nH5e: You\\\\\\'ll need a camera. You\\\\\\'ve probably seen one already.\\\\\\\\nH5f: There\\\\\\'s a camera in Pete\\\\\\'s Swapshop on Level 13.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: Where do I find the photos?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: First you\\\\\\'ll need something to take the pictures with.\\\\\\\\nH6b: Got that? Good.\\\\\\\\nH6c: You can find a map, but not the real Director...\\\\\\\\nH6d: ...and you\\\\\\'re already inside the arcology.\\\\\\\\nH6e: All the pictures can be found in the Education Levels.\\\\\\\\nH6f: Try exploring a little.\\\\\\\\nH6g: The Director\\\\\\'s Statue is in the Citadel on Level 24.\\\\\\\\nH6h: The Arcology model will do -- that\\\\\\'s on Level 23 in the museum.\\\\\\\\nH6i: See the hints for the appropriate level for these photos.\\\\\\\\nH6j: You can find a map on Level 25. Not the holomap, a different one.\\\\\\\\nH6k: You\\\\\\'ll need to make contact in the Waterline Club first, so follow\\\\\\\\n     the hints from there. Read Q8 below if you\\\\\\'re still stuck after that.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: Does the student have anything else of value?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: Have you seen what he\\\\\\'s wearing?\\\\\\\\nH7b: Have you noticed a series of similar items around?\\\\\\\\nH7c: Try asking the student about the Freedom.\\\\\\\\nH7d: He has a subbuteo piece of Anya Kaparov.\\\\\\\\nH7e: He\\\\\\'ll only give it to you after you\\\\\\'ve helped.\\\\\\\\nH7f: Fix the computer, get the photos and then ask him for the piece.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: Is there anywhere else to go on campus?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: There\\\\\\'s the cafeteria for a start.\\\\\\\\nH8b: Besides that? It\\\\\\'s too easy to get lost without a map.\\\\\\\\nH8c: Fortunately you have one.\\\\\\\\nH8d: If you have a particular department in mind, you can find it.\\\\\\\\nH8e: Don\\\\\\'t continue unless you\\\\\\'ve found Professor Zacharias\\\\\\' book.\\\\\\\\nH8f: Seems like a useful man to find.\\\\\\\\nH8g: He\\\\\\'s in the economics department, so look that up.\\\\\\\\nH8h: Head off to the south.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ9: How do I get past the retinal scanner?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH9a: Have you tried looking in the scanner?\\\\\\\\nH9b: It was worth a shot. Presumably you have the book by Professor Z.\\\\\\\\nH9c: The key is opening the book.\\\\\\\\nH9d: Try reading the hints for the library on level 22 to do that.\\\\\\\\nH9e: The next step should be obvious.\\\\\\\\nH9f: Wear the lenses and look in the scanner.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ10: What can I do in Professor Zacharias\\\\\\' office?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: Not much to start with.\\\\\\\\nH10b: Try listening to the professor.\\\\\\\\nH10c: He won\\\\\\'t let you touch anything in his office, so your options are limited.\\\\\\\\nH10d: But you can look around. See anything useful?\\\\\\\\nH10e: Look at the map more closely.\\\\\\\\nH10f: It shows the economy and Utopia corporations. Need that for anything?\\\\\\\\nH10g: Take a picture. It\\\\\\'ll do for the student\\\\\\'s portfolio.\\\\\\\\nH10h: You can\\\\\\'t do anything more until you have class two citizen status.\\\\\\\\nH10i: And still not much more until you\\\\\\'ve completed Zacharias\\\\\\' tasks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ11: I\\\\\\'ve got class two citizen status. What now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH11a: What did the professor say?\\\\\\\\nH11b: It might be worth a second visit.\\\\\\\\nH11c: In fact, it\\\\\\'s essential.\\\\\\\\nH11d: The professor gives you a new task.\\\\\\\\nH11e: Notice he gave you a work permit. \\\\\\\\n      Try visiting the other levels Zacharias mentioned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ12: When do I come back to see Zacharias?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH12a: Have you tried re-entering his office?\\\\\\\\nH12b: After visiting him as a class two citizen?\\\\\\\\nH12c: Seems he doesn\\\\\\'t want to be disturbed.\\\\\\\\nH12d: Come back after you\\\\\\'ve finished the set tasks.\\\\\\\\nH12e: In fact, there\\\\\\'ll be another reason for coming back later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ13: How do I avoid being captured by the executives?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH13a: You can\\\\\\'t. Go to Zacharias\\\\\\' office after completing all his\\\\\\\\n      tasks and you\\\\\\'ll be arrested.\\\\\\\\nH13b: Once you\\\\\\'re captured, time becomes critical.\\\\\\\\nH13c: You may want to complete other miscellaneous tasks first.\\\\\\\\nH13d: But you\\\\\\'ll need to get captured eventually.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ14: Professor Zacharias is no longer in his office. What can I find?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH14a: The first time he\\\\\\'s not there some rather nasty women are.\\\\\\\\nH14b: After that, you can take a look around.\\\\\\\\nH14c: Remember what Zacharias said before he died?\\\\\\\\nH14d: About breaking legs?\\\\\\\\nH14e: See any legs to break?\\\\\\\\nH14f: Break the two table legs - you\\\\\\'ll find some useful items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ15: What\\\\\\'s the pentagon headed cyberjack for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH15a: For putting in a pentagon shaped hole, obviously.\\\\\\\\nH15b: It must be somewhere where Zacharias has access.\\\\\\\\nH15c: Remember the features of the other interface ports?\\\\\\\\nH15d: They were all copper rimmed. See any copper around?\\\\\\\\nH15e: Try looking at the map.\\\\\\\\nH15f: What to look for should be obvious, since you have the jack.\\\\\\\\nH15g: Look for a pentagon on the map -- there\\\\\\'s your access port.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ16: I\\\\\\'m in cyberspace. What are these pyramids for?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH16a: Have you looked at them all?\\\\\\\\nH16b: There are five in total.\\\\\\\\nH16c: One of them has extra information.\\\\\\\\nH16d: A number and a message.\\\\\\\\nH16e: There are four digits in the number, and five pyramids.\\\\\\\\nH16f: The purpose is more clear when you\\\\\\'ve been to level 32.\\\\\\\\nH16g: This is where Zacharias stored important information.\\\\\\\\nH16h: The pyramids are crucial to obtaining the security codes \\\\\\\\n      for Zacharias\\\\\\' safety deposit box at the bank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ17: What does the message on the copper pyramid mean?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH17a: It says start with a number. That\\\\\\'s the first security code.\\\\\\\\nH17b: The next part says go clockwise.\\\\\\\\nH17c: The order the pyramids come in is important.\\\\\\\\nH17d: And connecting to the order of the codes.\\\\\\\\nH17e: Starting there and going clockwise, the pyramids are copper,\\\\\\\\n      glass, sandstone, red and silver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ18: Some of these pyramids look familiar.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH18a: You\\\\\\'ve seen at least two already: silver and glass.\\\\\\\\nH18b: Out in the real world.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ19: There\\\\\\'s only one number in cyberspace. Where are the other\\\\\\\\n     four codes?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH19a: Zacharias wouldn\\\\\\'t store them all in one place.\\\\\\\\nH19b: You\\\\\\'ll need to look for the pyramids elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ20: Where\\\\\\'s the glass pyramid (second) security code?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH20a: Look at the pyramid closely.\\\\\\\\nH20b: A woman on a motorcycle. Remember that?\\\\\\\\nH20c: The pyramid is the roof of the game zone.\\\\\\\\nH20d: There\\\\\\'s only one room to search.\\\\\\\\nH20e: Any numbers on the videogame?\\\\\\\\nH20f: The code is hidden in the high score table.\\\\\\\\nH20g: The high score for Mother Nature is the second security code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ21: Where\\\\\\'s the sandstone pyramid (third) security code?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH21a: Look at the pyramid closely.\\\\\\\\nH21b: It\\\\\\'s a real place.\\\\\\\\nH21c: The base is a hint.\\\\\\\\nH21d: Seen anything that glows yellow?\\\\\\\\nH21e: Jack out of cyberspace and you\\\\\\'ll be right next to it.\\\\\\\\nH21f: The code is hidden on the map in Zacharias\\\\\\' office.\\\\\\\\nH21g: See the hints at the end for more advice.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ22: Where\\\\\\'s the red pyramid (fourth) security code?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH22a: The pyramid looks unearthly doesn\\\\\\'t it?\\\\\\\\nH22b: It\\\\\\'s not on Earth.\\\\\\\\nH22c: Actually this one is on Mars...\\\\\\\\nH22d: ...in cyberspace.\\\\\\\\nH22e: Zacharias had an important item on him when he died.\\\\\\\\nH22f: Go to the morgue on level 31, get the ticket and follow\\\\\\\\n      the trail from there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ23: Where\\\\\\'s the silver pyramid (fifth) security code?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH23a: You\\\\\\'ve already seen a silver pyramid...\\\\\\\\nH23b: ...but the code is usually invisible.\\\\\\\\nH23c: You need to retrieve the pyramid given to you by\\\\\\\\n      Old Bruce if you don\\\\\\'t have it.\\\\\\\\nH23d: Notice the shaft of purple light.\\\\\\\\nH23e: That\\\\\\'s telling you the pyramid needs to be in purple light.\\\\\\\\nH23f: There\\\\\\'s only one place where the light is purple.\\\\\\\\nH23g: You may need to change the wavelength.\\\\\\\\nH23h: Go to the biodome on level 12, change the wavelength to \\\\\\\\n      violet (380-449) and look at the pyramid again.\\\\\\\\nH23i: The number is the fifth security code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ24: Does the map in the office have a hidden purpose?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH24a: There are two important things about the map.\\\\\\\\nH24b: You\\\\\\'ll need to be alone in the office to discover them.\\\\\\\\nH24c: Find the items in the office if you haven\\\\\\'t already.\\\\\\\\nH24d: Look at the hints for Q15 first.\\\\\\\\nH24e: See the hints below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ25: How do I read the map?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH25a: Read the hints for Q16 if you haven\\\\\\'t done so.\\\\\\\\nH25b: There\\\\\\'s more to the map than an access port.\\\\\\\\nH25c: Notice how the map glows. You can make it brighter.\\\\\\\\nH25d: You can\\\\\\'t control the map brightness but...\\\\\\\\nH25e: Turn off the desk lamp. That should brighten things up.\\\\\\\\nH25f: Notice anything about the map colour?\\\\\\\\nH25g: Try wearing the lenses then looking again.\\\\\\\\nH25h: There are grid references on the map.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ26: What do I look for on the map?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH26a: You can look up specific places.\\\\\\\\nH26b: If you haven\\\\\\'t visited the pentagon, don\\\\\\'t read any further.\\\\\\\\nH26c: Remember the stone pyramid? It\\\\\\'s a real place.\\\\\\\\nH26d: Find Giza -- the map reference is the third security code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n=======================\\\\\\\\n---RECREATION LEVELS---\\\\\\\\n=======================\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGENERAL QUESTIONS\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: How do I reach the recreation levels?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: You need to gain access to the residential and education levels first.\\\\\\\\nH1b: After that, concentrate on getting class two citizen status.\\\\\\\\nH1c: The university on level 25 is a good place to start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 26 - TRAVEL AGENT\\\\\\\\n-----------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: The conductor won\\\\\\'t let me do anything!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: You can\\\\\\'t bargain with the robot.\\\\\\\\nH1b: Or destroy it.\\\\\\\\nH1c: Or outsmart it.\\\\\\\\nH1d: So you need a ticket.\\\\\\\\nH1e: You\\\\\\'ll find one in plain sight later on...\\\\\\\\nH1f: ...when you have access to the administration levels.\\\\\\\\nH1g: It\\\\\\'s in the morgue on level 31.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: I got a ticket. Now what?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Hand it to the conductor.\\\\\\\\nH2b: The rest should be obvious.\\\\\\\\nH2c: Take a seat and enjoy the trip.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What is there to see on the red planet?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: There are some nice canyons.\\\\\\\\nH3b: And a red pyramid.\\\\\\\\nH3c: Seen anything like it before?\\\\\\\\nH3d: You may want to check out Zacharias\\\\\\' office throughly.\\\\\\\\nH3e: Zacharias\\\\\\' fourth security code is hidden here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: Where is the security code hidden?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: Have you examined everything in sight?\\\\\\\\nH4b: The pyramid?\\\\\\\\nH4c: The canyons?\\\\\\\\nH4d: The latter seems to have a pattern. Maybe if you had a better view.\\\\\\\\nH4e: Climb the pyramid and try looking at the canyons again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: I can\\\\\\'t see the canyons because off the sun.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: You need to shield your eyes.\\\\\\\\nH5b: Astronauts deal with this situation a lot.\\\\\\\\nH5c: There\\\\\\'s a visor on your spacesuit.\\\\\\\\nH5d: And a control to lower it.\\\\\\\\nH5e: But your head is inflexible inside the helmet.\\\\\\\\nH5f: So you can\\\\\\'t see the back and side.\\\\\\\\nH5g: You\\\\\\'ve had to find things you couldn\\\\\\'t see before.\\\\\\\\nH5h: Feel the spacesuit then turn the knob.\\\\\\\\nH5i: Now look at the canyons from atop the pyramid.\\\\\\\\nH5j: The number you see is the fourth security code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 27 - UTOPIA STUDIOS \\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: The studio gates are locked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: Have you looked at the gates?\\\\\\\\nH1b: Tried forcing your way through?\\\\\\\\nH1c: There\\\\\\'s no way inside the studios. Yet.\\\\\\\\nH1d: You\\\\\\'ll need to come back later.\\\\\\\\nH1e: If you haven\\\\\\'t done so, go see Professor Zacharias to \\\\\\\\n     get additional instructions.\\\\\\\\nH1f: Visit the other two areas he mentioned.\\\\\\\\nH1g: The biodome is on level 12, and the casino on level 29.\\\\\\\\nH1h: Complete your missions there.\\\\\\\\nH1i: Then the studio gates will be open.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: I\\\\\\'m going to be a movie star!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Good for you.\\\\\\\\nH2b: But it\\\\\\'s only a B-vid.\\\\\\\\nH2c: And you\\\\\\'re not here to enjoy yourself.\\\\\\\\nH2d: Like Nanci said, you\\\\\\'ll only get one shot.\\\\\\\\nH2e: And you only have ten minutes to get ready.\\\\\\\\nH2f: So ditch what you\\\\\\'re carrying and put on the costume.\\\\\\\\nH2g: Don\\\\\\'t forget the holopistol.\\\\\\\\nH2h: You\\\\\\'ll get your items back later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What am I supposed to do with the script?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: What do you think?\\\\\\\\nH3b: Examine it. Read it.\\\\\\\\nH3c: You need more specific information.\\\\\\\\nH3d: Remember what the producer said?\\\\\\\\nH3e: You\\\\\\'re playing Chinese Soldier #143.\\\\\\\\nH3f: So try finding that part in the script.\\\\\\\\nH3g: It would be unprofessional to take the script with you.\\\\\\\\nH3h: You\\\\\\'ll need to memorise the part.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: I keep getting kicked off the movie set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: You do know what you\\\\\\'re doing?\\\\\\\\nH4b: Read the script if you didn\\\\\\'t.\\\\\\\\nH4c: And more than a cursory glance is required.\\\\\\\\nH4d: See the hints for Q3 if you haven\\\\\\'t.\\\\\\\\nH4e: The rest is all about acting.\\\\\\\\nH4f: Everything Chinese Soldier #143 does is important.\\\\\\\\nH4g: You must perform the actions correctly, and in sequence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: What are my lines?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: You have read the script?\\\\\\\\nH5b: Your specific part? See the hints for Q3 and Q4.\\\\\\\\nH5c: Your character doesn\\\\\\'t say much. Only three words.\\\\\\\\nH5d: But there\\\\\\'s a lot of action.\\\\\\\\nH5e: The first instruction is to shoot the zombies, so do that.\\\\\\\\nH5f: The weapon has already jammed, so the next step is...\\\\\\\\nH5g: Throw the gun at a zombie.\\\\\\\\nH5h: Next you have to say something.\\\\\\\\nH5i: Say I\\\\\\'m out.\\\\\\\\nH5j: Got the hang of it now? The rest is all action.\\\\\\\\nH5k: Climb onto a zombie, jump up and grab the gun.\\\\\\\\nH5l: Still struggling?\\\\\\\\nH5m: Shoot the zombie. Break the crawling zombie\\\\\\'s neck.\\\\\\\\nH5n: All you have to do is scream. Then fall into the hole.\\\\\\\\nH5o: Whew!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: I\\\\\\'ve done my bit. Now what?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: They\\\\\\'re still shooting the movie.\\\\\\\\nH6b: But you\\\\\\'re not on camera any more.\\\\\\\\nH6c: You need to find a way backstage.\\\\\\\\nH6d: Dressing up as a zombie may confuse the crew.\\\\\\\\nH6e: And there\\\\\\'s one in the hole beside you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: Why\\\\\\'s Nanci acting strange?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: It does seem rather odd.\\\\\\\\nH7b: You have more important things to worry about now.\\\\\\\\nH7c: You\\\\\\'ll find out why soon enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: How do I get a zombie uniform?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: Have you tried taking the one from the robot.\\\\\\\\nH8b: Colombian uniforms are a different colour to the Chinese.\\\\\\\\nH8c: So the one you\\\\\\'re wearing is no good.\\\\\\\\nH8d: Unless you disguise it somehow.\\\\\\\\nH8e: Look at the Colombian uniform. Read the description.\\\\\\\\nH8f: It\\\\\\'s covered in mud.\\\\\\\\nH8g: So take your uniform off, drop it in the mud, and put it back on.\\\\\\\\nH9h: Now your body looks like a zombie.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ9: How do I get the zombie\\\\\\'s mask?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH9a: That would be useful.\\\\\\\\nH9b: Have you tried taking the mask?\\\\\\\\nH9c: It might be easier to get if the zombie lost its head.\\\\\\\\nH9d: Fortunately you have the means to do that.\\\\\\\\nH9e: What happened on the movie set?\\\\\\\\nH9f: Try shooting the zombie\\\\\\'s head.\\\\\\\\nH9g: Not working? Remember how holopistol\\\\\\'s work.\\\\\\\\nH9h: The robots are light sensitive.\\\\\\\\nH9i: And this one\\\\\\'s covered in mud.\\\\\\\\nH9j: Try cleaning its head first, then shoot it.\\\\\\\\nH9k: Now you can get the mask.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ10: I\\\\\\'m wearing the uniform and mask, but keep getting caught.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: Did you disguise the uniform? See the hints for Q8.\\\\\\\\nH10b: Read the text carefully.\\\\\\\\nH10c: Holding the pistol gives you away.\\\\\\\\nH10d: So drop the gun. It\\\\\\'s useless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ11: I made it backstage to the prop room. Now what?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH11a: Did you hear what Nanci said?\\\\\\\\nH11b: That box looks important. Examine it.\\\\\\\\nH11c: You need a hexagonal headed cyberjack.\\\\\\\\nH11d: Luckily there\\\\\\'s one around.\\\\\\\\nH11e: Search the storage shelves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ12: This looks like a trap to me.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH12a: Well spotted.\\\\\\\\nH12b: But sometimes you need to spring a trap.\\\\\\\\nH12c: So jack into the black box.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ13: I\\\\\\'m in cyberspace. This place looks familiar.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH13a: It should. You\\\\\\'ve been there before.\\\\\\\\nH13b: Appears everything was a deception.\\\\\\\\nH13c: Ivory Worm has you in a trap. You need to escape.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ14: How do I escape from cyberspace?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH14a: Have you tried jacking out?\\\\\\\\nH14b: It won\\\\\\'t be that easy.\\\\\\\\nH14c: Listen to what Ivory says before the scenario restarts.\\\\\\\\nH14d: You need to find a bug in cyberspace.\\\\\\\\nH14e: Is there anything that could take place out of sequence?\\\\\\\\nH14f: Doing what you\\\\\\'re supposed to won\\\\\\'t help.\\\\\\\\nH14g: You need to change the order things happen.\\\\\\\\nH14h: Not much happens you can interact with.\\\\\\\\nH14i: The only actions involve the Nanci pill.\\\\\\\\nH14j: You\\\\\\'re supposed to take it then eat it.\\\\\\\\nH14k: But who says you have to follow orders?\\\\\\\\nH14l: If you tried to eat the pill before taking it...\\\\\\\\nH14m: Remember you want things to be out of sequence.\\\\\\\\nH14n: So insist on doing it that way around.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ15: I escaped Ivory Worm\\\\\\'s trap. What now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH15a: Aren\\\\\\'t you angry?\\\\\\\\nH15b: Just a little.\\\\\\\\nH15c: You don\\\\\\'t want to lose the element of surprise.\\\\\\\\nH15d: Attack Ivory Worm before she can react.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ16: Where\\\\\\'s Nanci gone?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH16a: Did you pay attention to what just happened?\\\\\\\\nH16b: Ivory Worm didn\\\\\\'t lie.\\\\\\\\nH16c: Nanci\\\\\\'s gone for good. You\\\\\\'re on your own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ17: How do I get out of the prop room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH17a: Have you tried leaving through the door?\\\\\\\\nH17b: You need a different strategy.\\\\\\\\nH17c: There\\\\\\'s no way to avoid being found.\\\\\\\\nH17d: If the crew man sees Ivory\\\\\\'s body, it won\\\\\\'t be good.\\\\\\\\nH17e: You need to hide her.\\\\\\\\nH17f: How did you conceal yourself?\\\\\\\\nH17g: Dress Ivory up as a zombie. Put the uniform and mask on her.\\\\\\\\nH17h: But she still looks suspicious lying on the floor.\\\\\\\\nH17i: Move her body to where the other robots are.\\\\\\\\nH17j: Drag Ivory Worm onto the shelf.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ18: How do I get back into the film studio?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH18a: You were lucky to escape before.\\\\\\\\nH18b: And you got all your stuff back.\\\\\\\\nH18c: There\\\\\\'s no need for a second visit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ19: I\\\\\\'ve done everything here. Where do I go next?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH19a: Ivory Worm\\\\\\'s revelations were startling.\\\\\\\\nH19b: You\\\\\\'re not the only one in danger.\\\\\\\\nH19c: Better check on Professor Zacharias.\\\\\\\\nH19d: Be warned. Timing is about to get critical.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 28 - GAME ZONE\\\\\\\\n--------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: I can\\\\\\'t go anywhere on level 28.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: Utopia likes its rules and procedures.\\\\\\\\nH1b: You need a permit to play games.\\\\\\\\nH1c: You\\\\\\'ll get one when you need it.\\\\\\\\nH1d: Ironically you\\\\\\'ll need to play and win games to get it.\\\\\\\\nH1e: A casino attendant on level 29 has a permit.\\\\\\\\nH1f: She\\\\\\'ll give it to you after you beat the casino games.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: I\\\\\\'m inside the game zone. What now?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH2a: Have you looked at the superbike?\\\\\\\\nH2b: You\\\\\\'d look cool riding that.\\\\\\\\nH2c: So get on and start the engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3: What happened to my score?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH3a: You\\\\\\'re playing a game. Remember?\\\\\\\\nH3b: A game within a game.\\\\\\\\nH3c: While you\\\\\\'re on the superbike, the score is the videogame score.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: What\\\\\\'s the maximum possible score on the videogame?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: Lucy Song is a very good player.\\\\\\\\nH4b: She scored close to the maximum.\\\\\\\\nH4c: The maximum possible score is 4000 points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: How many points do I need to score in the videogame?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: In a game it\\\\\\'s advisable to score as many points as possible.\\\\\\\\nH5b: The woman in the casino gave some instructions.\\\\\\\\nH5c: You need 2000 points to see the manager.\\\\\\\\nH5d: But there\\\\\\'s a bonus for scoring 4000.\\\\\\\\nH5e: A very important bonus.\\\\\\\\nH5f: You\\\\\\'ll get a subbuteo piece.\\\\\\\\nH5g: Which you need to finish the game.\\\\\\\\nH5h: In other words, you need 4000 points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: This videogame is hard. How many tries do I get?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: What makes you think there\\\\\\'s a limit?\\\\\\\\nH6b: You play as often as you want.\\\\\\\\nH6c: And may have to in order to learn the best strategy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: Any general advice for playing the videogame?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: Try it a few times to get a feel for it.\\\\\\\\nH7b: You gain points by causing destruction.\\\\\\\\nH7c: Do as much damage as possible.\\\\\\\\nH7d: Big explosions and stunts are a staple of the genre.\\\\\\\\nH7e: Pulling those off will earn you more points.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: What should I do in the showroom?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: Don\\\\\\'t worry about the guards. They\\\\\\'re poor shots.\\\\\\\\nH8b: This is an action game. Cause as much damage as possible.\\\\\\\\nH8c: Shooting those goons would be a start.\\\\\\\\nH8d: Did you examine the guards?

See the hints for Q11 first.\\\\\\\\nH12b: A shootout with the goons is a bad idea.\\\\\\\\nH12c: You could run them over.\\\\\\\\nH12d: That\\\\\\'s not the best solution however.\\\\\\\\nH12e: Do what you do best. Blow something up.\\\\\\\\nH12f: Read the text about the guards carefully.\\\\\\\\nH12g: They\\\\\\'re carrying something explosive.\\\\\\\\nH12h: Shoot the grenades.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ13: I\\\\\\'ve got a sedan on my tail!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH13a: Don\\\\\\'t worry.

You don\\\\\\'t have much.\\\\\\\\nH3k: Cover the lamp with a metal ball. Then show the woman the watch.\\\\\\\\nH3l: Give the attendant a number to match the time you\\\\\\'ll show her.\\\\\\\\nH3m: Timing is crucial here. Try again if you don\\\\\\'t get it.\\\\\\\\nH3n: And the balls are numbered 1 to 800 so you can only do this\\\\\\\\n     before 08:00.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: How do I win the Wheel of Fate?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: Play it a couple of times to see what happens.\\\\\\\\nH4b: You can\\\\\\'t rely on luck.\\\\\\\\nH4c: Have you tried deliberately turning the wheel to a gold segment?\\\\\\\\nH4d: You need to know how fast the wheel turns.\\\\\\\\nH4e: It moves too quickly to see.\\\\\\\\nH4f: Judgment is blind, like the attendant says.\\\\\\\\nH4g: The wheel\\\\\\'s making a real racket.\\\\\\\\nH4h: Listen while the wheel is turning.\\\\\\\\nH4i: Now you can make it land on the gold segment.\\\\\\\\nH4j: But you\\\\\\'ll need to be specific when you turn it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: How do I win the Utopian Lottery?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH5a: It\\\\\\'s a real lottery.\\\\\\\\nH5b: But the odds are much better if you know the secret.\\\\\\\\nH5c: Have you tried saving, restoring and watching a draw again?\\\\\\\\nH5d: The numbers follow a set sequence.\\\\\\\\nH5e: But saving and restoring won\\\\\\'t work because the attendant will \\\\\\\\n     test you.\\\\\\\\nH5f: Watch several draws in a row and make a note of the numbers.\\\\\\\\nH5g: There\\\\\\'s a pattern the numbers follow.\\\\\\\\nH5h: More specifically, three patterns.\\\\\\\\nH5i: Meagan in the arcade room has a hint. Ask her about the lottery.\\\\\\\\nH5j: One of the numbers is always prime.\\\\\\\\nH5k: That number follows the sequence of prime numbers between 1 and 50:\\\\\\\\n     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47\\\\\\\\nH5l: One number is a multiple of 10, decreasing each time:\\\\\\\\n     50, 40, 30, 20, 10\\\\\\\\nH5m: The last number is a square number, increasing in sequence:\\\\\\\\n     1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\\\\\\\nH5n: None of the numbers overlap. At the end of each sequence the number\\\\\\\\n     starts again from the beginning.\\\\\\\\nH5o: Based on the last three lottery numbers, you can work out the next three.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ6: Is Meagan good for anything?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH6a: You can ask her questions.\\\\\\\\nH6b: She won\\\\\\'t help you with the mission in the casino.\\\\\\\\nH6c: Apart from giving a couple of hints.\\\\\\\\nH6d: She has something else you need.\\\\\\\\nH6e: Look at Meagan\\\\\\'s clothes.\\\\\\\\nH6f: Ask her about the Freedom.\\\\\\\\nH6g: She has the Zara McCoy subbuteo piece.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ7: How do I play the trivia game?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH7a: Have you examined the machine?\\\\\\\\nH7b: No tokens? You\\\\\\'ll have to borrow one.\\\\\\\\nH7c: From someone close by.\\\\\\\\nH7d: Meagan has a lot of tokens to play with.\\\\\\\\nH7e: Try asking her for one.\\\\\\\\nH7f: You\\\\\\'ll have to take her up on the offer.\\\\\\\\nH7g: Tell Meagan to put a token in the trivia machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ8: Meagan always beats me! It\\\\\\'s not fair.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH8a: The quiz questions are the same each time.\\\\\\\\nH8b: But four are chosen at random from a set of eight.\\\\\\\\nH8c: With practice you can get all four right.\\\\\\\\nH8d: But the best you can manage is a draw.\\\\\\\\nH8e: Unless you cheat somehow.\\\\\\\\nH8f: Look at the machine closely.\\\\\\\\nH8g: Not everything is on the front.\\\\\\\\nH8h: Pull the machine away from the wall. Now look again. \\\\\\\\n     See anything familiar?\\\\\\\\nH8i: You can hack into the machine and mess with it.\\\\\\\\nH8j: But put it back before asking Meagan to play.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ9: I hacked into the trivia machine. What should I do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH9a: Did you examine the machine before jacking in? \\\\\\\\nH9b: Note the button colours.\\\\\\\\nH9c: Have you played against Meagan?\\\\\\\\nH9d: These are the databanks of questions and answers.\\\\\\\\nH9e: You can change the answers so Meagan gets her questions wrong.\\\\\\\\nH9f: What do you normally do with soccer balls?\\\\\\\\nH9g: Kick the balls to change the answers to that colour.\\\\\\\\nH9h: You can change the answers to whatever you like.\\\\\\\\nH9i: It\\\\\\'s probably easier to change them all to one colour.\\\\\\\\nH9j: That way you\\\\\\'ll remember the change.\\\\\\\\nH9k: And Meagan is guaranteed to get a question wrong.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ10: I\\\\\\'ve beaten all the games, but can\\\\\\'t get into the manager\\\\\\'s office.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: You only need to beat Lucky Dip, Wheel of Fate and the Lottery.\\\\\\\\nH10b: Have you visited the woman again?\\\\\\\\nH10c: More hoops to jump through.\\\\\\\\nH10d: The permit is for the game zone on level 28.\\\\\\\\nH10e: Go there and score at least 2000 points, then come back.\\\\\\\\nH10f: Now you can go upstairs.\\\\\\\\nH10g: But can only see the manager once per day.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ11: What\\\\\\'s my objective in the manager\\\\\\'s office?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH11a: You can\\\\\\'t get information from him directly.\\\\\\\\nH11b: And he won\\\\\\'t volunteer any.\\\\\\\\nH11c: Look around the office.\\\\\\\\nH11d: Notice the cyberjack interface port on the desk.\\\\\\\\nH11e: You need to jack in to get the information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ12: How do I distract the manager?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH12a: You have no choice here.\\\\\\\\nH12b: Have you tried distracting him? It\\\\\\'s obvious what he wants.\\\\\\\\nH12c: A kiss might work.\\\\\\\\nH12d: Sounds like he\\\\\\'s into rough stuff. And he likes tough girls.\\\\\\\\nH12e: Beat him up a little then try again.\\\\\\\\nH12f: Now he\\\\\\'s distracted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ13: Where\\\\\\'s the cyberjack for the cross shaped interface port?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH13a: He doesn\\\\\\'t trust his security staff that much.\\\\\\\\nH13b: The manager has the cyberjack on him.\\\\\\\\nH13c: It\\\\\\'s in his jacket.\\\\\\\\nH13d: You\\\\\\'ll need to distract him first. See the hints for Q11.\\\\\\\\nH13e: Now you can get the cyberjack.\\\\\\\\nH13f: Just don\\\\\\'t let the manager see you with it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ14: How do I reach the interface port without being seen?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH14a: It\\\\\\'s difficult from the middle of the room.\\\\\\\\nH14b: You need to decide where to distract the manager.\\\\\\\\nH14c: He likes being pushed around.\\\\\\\\nH14d: So push him onto the desk first.\\\\\\\\nH14e: You\\\\\\'ll need to keep him there.\\\\\\\\nH14f: Get on top of the manager... or the desk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ15: I\\\\\\'m in the manager\\\\\\'s cyberspace room, but can\\\\\\'t open the treasure chest.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH15a: Look at the chest.\\\\\\\\nH15b: You need something to put in those slots.\\\\\\\\nH15c: The items are nearby.\\\\\\\\nH15d: The playing cards will fit, but you need to choose specific ones.\\\\\\\\nH15e: Remember the manager\\\\\\'s tastes.\\\\\\\\nH15f: He has a thing for black women.\\\\\\\\nH15g: The cards you need are the queen of clubs and queen of spades.\\\\\\\\nH15h: Put those cards in the slots, and the chest will open.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ16: What should I do with the wealth of information?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH16a: It\\\\\\'s in cyberspace.\\\\\\\\nH16b: You can\\\\\\'t take the information with you.\\\\\\\\nH16c: But you do need to look at it.\\\\\\\\nH16d: That\\\\\\'s all you can do.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ17: I\\\\\\'ve got the information. How do I get back into the manager\\\\\\'s office?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH17a: Why do you want to?\\\\\\\\nH17b: You have everything you need.\\\\\\\\nH17c: So there\\\\\\'s no reason to go back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ18: I\\\\\\'ve completed my mission in the casino. What next?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH18a: Remember Zacharias\\\\\\' instructions... assuming you have them.\\\\\\\\nH18b: If you haven\\\\\\'t been to the biodome on level 12, go there.\\\\\\\\nH18c: If you\\\\\\'ve already completed that task, the only place left is the film\\\\\\\\n      studio.\\\\\\\\nH18d: The gates are open now, so go to level 27.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLEVEL 30 - NEO WEMBLEY STADIUM\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1: How do I get into the stadium?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH1a: It\\\\\\'s off limits for most of the game.\\\\\\\\nH1b: Until the very end.\\\\\\\\nH1c: Don\\\\\\'t continue until you\\\\\\'ve got class one citizen status.\\\\\\\\nH1d: And discovered Lucy Song\\\\\\'s secret.\\\\\\\\nH1e: Now you can finally get inside.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2: I\\\\\\'m inside the stadium.

She\\\\\\'ll retaliate and get dismissed.\\\\\\\\nH3e: Well? Go follow her down the tunnel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4: How do I get past Amber Bear in the changing room?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH4a: For a minute to so, you\\\\\\'re very dazed.\\\\\\\\nH4b: Concentrate on dodging her attacks first.\\\\\\\\nH4c: A high swing can be ducked.\\\\\\\\nH4d: And you can jump over the low swing.\\\\\\\\nH4e: Her third attack is unstoppable.\\\\\\\\nH4f: You need something to use against Amber.\\\\\\\\nH4g: There\\\\\\'s not much to play around with.\\\\\\\\nH4h: Not with that bench in the way.\\\\\\\\nH4i: That\\\\\\'s the only thing in reach.\\\\\\\\nH4j: Look at the bench after Amber\\\\\\'s swung it once.\\\\\\\\nH4k: That splinter will have to do.\\\\\\\\nH4l: You can\\\\\\'t get it until the bench is really damaged.\\\\\\\\nH4m: Amber Bear is out of attack range.\\\\\\\\nH4n: So you\\\\\\'ll have to do something else.\\\\\\\\nH4o: Throw the splinter at Amber.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ5: I\\\\\\'ve dealt with Amber.

How do I disarm the fission core?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nH10a: Obviously you need to cut the wires.\\\\\\\\nH10b: You need to cut all eight of them.\\\\\\\\nH10c: Naturally, they must be cut in the correct sequence.\\\\\\\\nH10d: Intuitively, each wire is only cut once.\\\\\\\\nH10e: Lucy Song gave you the sequence just now.\\\\\\\\nH10f: The eight things she mentioned refer to a wire.\\\\\\\\nH10g: From immigrant to class one citizen. That refers to \\\\\\\\n      the jewel colours.\\\\\\\\nH10h: Steel Rose to Utopia Freedom. What colour is a rose?\\\\\\\\n      And what colour do the Freedom wear?\\\\\\\\nH10i: From newbie to golden girl.
