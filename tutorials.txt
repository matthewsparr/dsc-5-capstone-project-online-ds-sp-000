circumstances, while a mischievous ape tries repeatedly to pull your
shorts down"

This document contains complete spoilers for the game "Three Monkeys One
Cage" by Robert Goodwin. It is inadvisable to be reading this if you
haven't looked at the general in-game hints (type "HINT" during the
game), and even then this document should be used sparingly. The game is
hard, but try to solve as much of it by yourself as you can, yeah?
You'll feel better about yourself.

This solution is explained by sections.

THE MANDRILL -- Keeping him out of your hair

Generally whenever the mandrill enters your corner of the cage or you
enter his, you have one turn to act before he does you in. Early on you
can avoid death by simply moving to a differenct corner of the cage
whenever he approaches. After no sooner than 50 turns into the game the
mandrill will become more aggressive, chasing you almost every turn.
Temporary methods of fending him off, such as throwing dirt at him or
hiding under the bed, may give you a quick breather, but you need a
long-term solution. There are two...


THE HORNETS -- Dangerous when aggravated

The hornets will mind their own business just as long as you don't go
casting a stone at their nest, at which point they will fly all about,
attacking both monkeys and you. From this time on both the chimpanzee
and mandrill will do nothing but run around wildly. This is good in the
sense that the mandrill no longer poses a threat to you, but bad in the
sense that the chimpanzee can no longer help you. Therefore you must
wait until you no longer need the chimpanzee before taking this course
of action, because there is no way to recall the hornets. (If the game
becomes unwinnable when you throw the rock at the nest then you still
needed the chimpanzee to do something)

How do you survive the hornets yourself? Hiding under the bed is only a
temporary solution. To protect yourself for good you'll need to cover
yourself with a sheet or a blanket.


THE FIRE -- Ins and outs of taming flame

Neither the mandrill nor chimpanzee will enter any corner of the cage
where fire or smoke is if they can help it. In order to build a fire you
will need flint, steel, and tinder. The stone serves as flint. The
barbecue fork, the bucket, or the fan serves as steel. The sheet,
blanket, or jersey can be used as tinder. Obviously, to keep the fire
going you'll have to keep feeding it with flammable objects.

If you choose to build the fire in the southwest corner of the cage, you
have the advantage of being able to use the fan to blow smoke (when the
fire is large enough to produce sufficient smoke) to one of the other
three corners. By rotating the fan you can steer the mandrill out of any
corner of your choosing. In addition, the fire will last longer when the
fan is on.

The risk you take when you build the fire in the southwest corner is
that it might catch to your bed. If this happens you must act quickly.
Put out the fire by throwing or kicking dirt onto it.


THE BUCKET -- Don't kick it yourself, let somebody do it for you

How do you get the bucket off the platform? There is no way to get atop
the platform yourself. Only the chimpanzee can, but he needs an
incentive to go there. Hmm, I wonder what that might be. Yes, toss the
banana onto the platform. The chimpanzee will soon jump after it,
knocking the bucket off inadvertently. The bucket will land in the
southwest corner.


BUILDING THE PULLEY -- It's the only way to open the gate

The solution to Three Monkeys One Cage in a nutshell is to set up a
pulley system in which the cord is slung over the bar that protrudes
from the wall, with a bucket attached to the end of the cord. The other
end of the cord is already attached to the top of the gate permanently.
When a weight falls into the bucket, the bucket descends, causing the
gate to rise.

The cord can be tied to various objects, then thrown over the bar. It is
not enough simply to tie the cord to the bucket, for you'll find out
that the cord is short by just a tiny margin when the weight falls and
misses it. You must first tie the cord to a hook, then once the cord is
dangling from the bar you must get the bucket hanging from the hook
somehow. A hook can be found underneath your bed.

The only way to get the bucket onto the hook once it has been slung over
the bar is to lift it using the barbecue fork.


ACTIVATING THE PULLEY -- Getting the weight to drop

Once your pulley is all set up you are ready to drop the weight in the
bucket. If you haven't guessed already, it is a coconut that must be
used for the weight. Have the chimpanzee get one for you. (CHIMP, CLIMB
TREE followed by CHIMP, GET COCONUT)

The coconut must roll down the trough, which you cannot reach yourself.
You need the chimpanzee again for this. (CHIMP, PUT COCONUT ON TROUGH)
If the coconut isn't staying on the trough properly, that is because you
did not remove the husk. You can crack it open with the stone or with
the barbecue fork.

Just because the coconut is on the trough does not mean that it will
roll automatically. The trough must be inclined. You can use the
barbecue fork to raise one end of it. At last, the coconut will fall
into the bucket and the gate will open! (If the coconut isn't landing
squarely in the bucket, read the previous section carefully)


GETTING OUT ALIVE -- How to leap a great distance and live to tell

After you've gotten the gate open there is still more puzzle left to be
solved. The distance to the ground below is too great to jump, yet jump
you must. But you'll need to make some preparations. To begin with, you
must use the cord again in a different way. You need to hold onto it, or
tie it around your waist when you leap outside. The dilemma is in the
fact that the cord can only be used for one purpose at a time; it can't
be tied around your waist while it is being used for the pulley. Were
you to remove the bucket from the hook with the barbecue fork, then pull
away the cord, the gate would go back down. Thus you must keep the gate
open another way while you remove the cord from the bar. Do this by
placing an object in the opening to hold the gate up. Namely, the
barbecue fork.


DISMANTLING THE PULLEY -- But only once you no longer need it

The gate's open and you need that cord again. But the barbecue fork
which could otherwise be used to remove the bucket from the hook is no
longer available. How do you retrieve the cord? This is perhaps the most
difficult part of the puzzle, and it requires some timing. The fact is
that you DO need the fork for this. Before placing it in the gate you
must use that versatile tool in one more capacity--as a torch. The
barbecue fork can be used to lift burning objects out of the fire, such
as the jersey, or the banana peel, or the coconut husk. You can then
"light the fuse" by touching the torch to the cord. Then, before the
cord snaps, extinguish the burning object and wedge that fork in the
gate, as explained above.


THE FINAL STEP -- Before you can fly the cage

Using the procedure described in the previous two sections, you can
almost survive that drop. One more precaution need be taken in order for
you to fall the remainder of the distance without injury. You must
cushion your fall. Throw as many object out the cage as you like, but
the only one that will make any difference is the mattress. Be aware
that you can't pick up the mattress while you're carrying other things.


THE ANVILS -- Death from above

After precisely 100 turns into the game, panels on the ceiling will open
up to release heavy anvils. A falling anvil will most certainly crush
you in five turns unless you take cover by hiding under your bed.
Whereupon the anvils will cease, and bombs will begin dropping in their
stead. When the bombs start dropping you have only nine turns left to
complete the game, so act quickly! There is no way to outlive the bombs
save by completing the puzzle and escaping from the cage.

Questions and Answers
=====================

A. General Questions
--------------------

Can I restore my saved games without having to wait?

 - With the MS-DOS version, you can change your computer's time to
   be more than 30 minutes past the save time. Or you can change the time
   in the save file to be earlier. Changing the byte at position 0C (hex) 
   to a value of 0 always seems to work.


I'm dying of thirst? What do I do?

 - Drink some water.

 - There are various places in the game (including the building) that
   make good water sources. You can also carry one drink's worth in the
   bottle.

 - And the flask also takes a small amount of water.


I'm running out of light! What can I do?

 - You could make sure you finish the game before your lantern dies.

 - You could buy some batteries in the 'all different' maze.

 - You could use the appropriate magic words. They will give your lamp
   a one-time boost good for several hundred moves.

 - Harnessing electricity is a kind of sorcery.

 - There are a couple of words you may have seen that suggest a famous
   person often associated with electricity.

 - They're found in the Sorcerer's Lair. Type them as separate commands.

 - Don't do it until your lamp is out of power.

 - Drop your lamp first. 


What do I do about these little dwarves?

 - If you could just get them on your side, you could have one heck
   of a party.

 - But they're set in their ways. 

 - The first dwarf that attacks you drops an axe. Get it, then throw it
   whenever there are dwarves attacking you.

 - Throwing the sword works too, as does just waving it about.

 - Eventually, you'll also learn a magic word that you can use to defeat
   them.


A pirate stole my treasure. How can I get it back?

 - Actually, you need this to happen, or you won't be able to get his
   treasure chest.
 
 - After he steals from you, go find his chest in the 'all alike' maze.
   He won't steal from you after you get it.


What should I do with the dwarf's horn?

 - A bunch of dwarves attack you when you blow it.

 - The right magic word might get rid of them.

 - It's handy for getting back any treasure stolen by the dwarves.

 - It's easier if you wear some protection.

 - And a magic way to get rid of the dwarves helps too, just be
   careful you follow the instructions.

 - Then again, you could call the owl instead.


B. Above Ground
---------------

What am I doing here?
 
 - As an adventurer of some ambition, you are trying to collect a bunch 
   of treasures in the small brick building without getting killed.

 - If you do, you might get a nice reward.

 - You may be looking for something in which to carry water.

 - Follow the path that leads away from the house.

 _ I said "the path", not "the road"!


How do I get into the cave?
	
 - There are two ways.

 - The obvious way is to unlock the grate with the keys from the building.

 - You will also learn a couple of magic words that will let you teleport
   in and out from the building.


How do I get past the wizard's gate?

 - The gate is hinged on both sides.

 - First, you have to undo the hinges with some sort of screwdriver.

 - A certain treasure would make a good screwdriver.

 - I'm lying -- there's no way past.


What's the meaning of the wooden notice?

 - I would read it as 'To those who come after me: this is the place to
   ---- the s--'.

 - It's not important until much later in the game. I'd better not reveal
   the answer just yet.


C. Hall of Mists and Vicinity
-----------------------------

How do I get past the snake?

 - You can't subdue it yourself.

 - You need the help of another being.

 - Catch the bird in the cage, then 'drop bird' or 'free bird' in the 
   Hall of Mt King.


How can I keep the bird from being frightened?

 - Read carefully what the game tells you when you first ask for help.

 - The bird is afraid of something about you.

 - Did you read the instructions offered to you when you entered the game?
   It is written: "Some objects have side-effects; for instance, rods
   scare birds."

 - It's afraid of your black rod. Drop it before trying to catch the bird.


How do I get past the dragon?

 - Just attack it.

 - Yes, with your bare hands.

 - Don't you wish all the monsters were this wimpy?


How do I get the Persian rug?

 - Roll it up first.


How do I get the gold nugget out of the cave?

 - You could try throwing it to that passage above the dome.

 - But the result is not very convenient.

 - Rather than carrying it up the steps, use a magic-word exit.


What does the hollow voice mean?

 - It's saying a magic word.

 - The word will teleport you between the Y2 room and the building.
   This is usually the quickest way to get from the cave to the building
   and back.


How do I get across the fissure?

 - Wave the rod. (Nothing really suggests this specifically, but it
   stands to reason that magic wands are made for waving.)


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all different?

 - The names of the locations are subtly different.

 - By making a grid and noting where each direction leads from
   each location, you can build a map. It's a hassle, though.

 - Actually, you don't need to go into this maze to finish the game with
   all the points.

 - I haven't mapped it all out myself. From the west end of long hall,
   you can go 'south, up, up, south' to get to the vending machine.

 - 'north, down, down, down' should get you back out.


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all alike?

 - This is probably the most famous maze in all of computer gaming. You
   should feel honored just to be lost in it. 

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.
   Then you can make a grid and chart out which directions go from where
   to where.

 - Or you can ask the game to cheat and show you the list of exits from
   every location, which makes them very much less alike.

 - The main thing is to get the pirate's treasure chest and any treasures
   he's stolen from you.

 - From the west end of the Hall of Mists, you can go south, east, south,
   south, south, north, east, east, northwest to get to the chest. Then go
   southeast, north, down to get out of the maze.


What does the message in the sandstone chamber mean?

 - It's a favourite quote from technical manuals.

 - It's in Dwarvish. Surely you can read Dwarvish!

 - Translate it by moving each letter back one in the alphabet.

 - This method works for translating the dwarves' speech, too.


How do I get the flute from the shadowy figure?

 - Is the figure trying to attract your attention?

 - Have you seen it in more than one place?

 - It seems familiar.

 - It looks a lot like you.

 - It is you. Go to the mirror canyon for an explanation.

 - There is no flute, of course. I made that up.

 - But you could try 'reflect' and see what happens.

 - Reflecting gets you to the other side of the mirror, though it is
   not at all obvious.


D. Anteroom and Vicinity
------------------------

What are the magazines for?

 - They are traditionally associated with a last lousy point.
  
 - Leaving them at Witt's End gives you that point. 

 - Why at Witt's End? I haven't the faintest idea.


How do I get out of Witt's End?

 - If you go west sixty-five times, you'll get to the anteroom. It 
   always feels longer on the way back.

 - Wait -- maybe it's 165 times.

 - Actually, just wander around, going any direction except west.
   After a few moves, you should get out.


How do I get the tusk out of the very low room?

 - There's no way to get it through the slit.

 - The only way out is down into the sewer, although you seem to die
   when you go there.

 - Perhaps you should wait till the sewage level drops.

 - Actually, if you go back up from the shaft and then down again, you'll
   be able to get into the sewers.

 - You'll find anything you lost down the shaft (or in the cellar), plus a
   spoon.

 - Make sure to find your way out before you drown, and before
   the rats get you.


How do I navigate the maze of passages with streams?

 - I must say, I roll my eyes at the solution to this one.

 - The game's hint suggests that you're somehow offending the dwarves,
   I guess.

 - You've just left the sewers. Maybe it's that nasty smell.

 - 'wash', then wander up until you get out.


How do I turn the spoon into a treasure?

 - 'epns' seems like it ought to be a magic word.

 - But it's not. 

 - Did you try polishing it?

 - I guess the spoon is just worthless.


What is the rope in the chapel for?

 - Climb it.


How can I get out of the giant's dungeon?

 - 'lift flagstone', then go south, then climb up.

 - Of course, you probably lost some stuff when you got thrown in, and
   the trick is getting it back.


What do I do in the giant's living quarters?

 - You could bring the food with you. Then he'll eat it and kick you
   back out. But that doesn't get you anywhere.

 - What else might the giant enjoy?

 - Bring the nest with you. While he's eating the eggs, you can do what you
   like. Of course, the nest is a treasure, so you'll need to get it back
   somehow. See the troll question for more help.

 - The room description doesn't actually say so, but you can go south, too.


How do I get past the spider?

 - Kill it with the sword.

 - But surely you don't have the sword yet.

 - You'll have to engage the help of a nearby friend.

 - The owl will eat the spider for you. Summon him with 'hoot'.

 - Your light scares him away. Turn it off first.

 - To get the documents, just cut the web with your axe.


How do I get the mask in the thieves den?

 - The game says you can't. And it tells the truth.


How do I get the orb from the cellar?

 - If you could only get past the portcullis.

 - Or the slab.

 - Or the drain. Which is it?

 - It's none of these. The actual solution seems obscure, frankly.

 - Get the orb, then drop something else. If it goes down the drain,
   get it later in the sewer.

 - If you drop anything large, e.g. the sword, the wizard kicks it out
   with you. 

 - Of course, you may be able to get the orb without going into the
   cellar.

 - A portcullis is not the same thing as a solid door, and the drain
   has its uses.

 - No, you'll have to work out the rest for yourself. Or go into
   the cellar, like everybody else does.



What do the images in the orb mean?

 - They're visions of things that will happen as you play the game.

 - They can be used as a guide in a particular chain of problems.

 - You'll have to work out for yourself how to know whether the
   vision you see indicates your next task, or some random future
   one.

 - You don't need to use the visions, so you don't need to be told
   how to do that.


What is the crypt for?

 - That's where the vampire shows up. I hope you found the crucifix and the
   holy water.

 - To summon the vampire, you need the wizard's help.

 - There are several ways to invoke the wizard's help. One of them involves
   the little bird. Read the description carefully.

 - Sorry, I'm lying again. The vampire doesn't move into the crypt until
   Adventure 770. In this game the crypt is just scenery.


How do I get into the storage room in the tower?

 - No way to do that in this version.



How do I get past the dwarves at the top of the stairs?

 - You could attack them from above.

 - First you'd need to get on top of the tower from the outside.

 - But you can't. There is no way to get past them. At least not in
   this version of the game.


What is special about the chalice?

 - If you fill the chalice and then drink, some strange things happen.
  
 - But whatever you do, you end up losing the chalice, which is a treasure.

 - It's fun to try, but I don't think you can help the princess 
   successfully. Just treat the chalice like any other treasure.


E. Bedquilt and Vicinity
------------------------

Can I get around the Bedquilt area more easily?

 - In some places, you can type the name of an adjacent room
   to get to it. That can help avoid the problem of crawling around and
   winding up back where you started from.


How do I keep the vase from shattering?

 - You need to cushion its fall.

 - Before you drop it, drop the pillow from the soft room.


How do I get a light source into the room past the emerald?

 - If you could carry a light source into the plover room, that would do
   it. But nothing will fit in from the west. 

 - Are there any other ways to get to the plover room?

 - Yes, actually. Pay attention to the bad pun in the plover room hint.

 - "Why to plover" means "Y2, plover". Typing 'plover' in the Y2 room
   will get you there. 'Plover' will get you back too, but you can't get
   the emerald out that way. This is not something you could figure out,
   but you can stumble across the solution by trying to refer to the 
   plover-egg-sized emerald as "plover".

 - There is actually a way to get a light source into the plover room
   from the alcove, as the hint suggests.

 - It's something that can be in two places at once.

 - But you need to ignite it first.



What do I do with the clam?

 - You can pick it up.

 - You can open it.

 - What would be a good tool for clam prying? Think of sea-related things.

 - 'open clam' while you're carrying the trident.

 - A pearl rolled out. Go down to the cul-de-sac and get it.


How do I get past the quicksand?

 - Create a bridge.

 - Read the game's responses carefully.

 - When you wave the rod here, although nothing obvious happens, you
   temporarily solidify the quicksand. You have to wave the rod again
   to get back.


How do I cross the reservoir?

 - A full-sized yacht would help.

 - Could you magick the "Ruby Yacht" (my, what an awful pun!) to grow
   in size? Or maybe shrink yourself enough to use the yacht?

 - No dice. You can't get across it from the south.

 - Read the game's hint.

 - You can get to the north side by going down the whirlpool in the 
   waterfall cavern. Make sure not to take anything but your lamp.

 - Hit the gong to summon Darwin, whom you can ride south.


How do I get the sword in the stone?

 - Like the game's hint says, you're just not strong enough.

 - Someone with bulging muscles could probably pull it out.

 - Eat the mushroom from the dank cave.


How can I keep from losing objects in the valuation room?

 - Don't drop them there.


F. The Plant and Beyond
-----------------------

What do I do with the little plant?

 - It seems to want water.

 - Bring water in your bottle, then 'water plant'.

 - Do it once more for good measure. Now you can climb up to the hole.

 - Maybe you should try watering it a third time?


How do I get past the rusted door?

 - It just needs a little oil.

 - Fill your bottle with oil from the east pit in the Twopit room,
   then 'oil door'.


How do I get past the ogre?

 - The game's hint warns against hand-to-hand combat. 

 - Throw something.

 - The axe isn't good enough.

 - Throw the sword. Its name is 'Thrower', after all.


Is there anything to do in the Sorcerer's Lair?

 - Remember the magic words on the wall.

 - You might have seen or will see something that emits blue light.
   Maybe it is at home here?

 - Try dropping the starstone here.

 - Yes, the effect can be handy in some special circumstances, but you 
   don't really need to do this.


How do I get past the sheets of slime?

 - Fight the green slime with something green.

 - Throw the vial from the spherical room.


How do I get out of the maze of ice tunnels?

 - Map the maze. The passages are all either straight, or bend only
   a little.

 - Don't miss the sculpture.

 - Look at your map upside down. It spells a five-letter word.

 - Go to the 'This way out' room and use that word.


G. The Troll and Beyond
-----------------------

How do I get past the troll?

 - Throw him a treasure.

 - You'll need one you can reclaim.

 - Throw him the nest.

 - Remember the words in the Giant room?

 - Type them, one after another. You should get the response 'Done!' at the
   end.

 - The eggs then return to the Giant room.

 - Make sure you don't reclaim them until you've finished with the area
   past the bridge. Otherwise the troll will take revenge on you.


How do I get back across the wooden bridge?

 - You need help. Something scary.

 - The bear can help.

 - Free him, then 'get bear'.

 - Use the keys to unlock the chain.

 - Feed the bear first.

 - Try to cross the bridge, then 'free bear'.


Is there anything to do in the volcano room?

 - Not in the original 350-point version of Adventure.

 - Here, yes.

 - Make a bridge. You know the routine.

 - You need something to protect you from the fumes. How about a
   mithril ring?

 - You can turn the sword into a ring. Use a magic word.

 - It's the word written on the stone you found the sword in.


What do I do at the minotaur statue?

 - There's a hint at a dead end elsewhere in the cave.

 - You need to use the proper tool.

 - The proper tool can be found in the tool room.

 - Not the rags. The proper tool is a magic word.


How do I get away from the gooseberry goblins?

 - Are you familiar with the myth of Cadmus?

 - I think he sowed something and grew an army of soldiers, although his
   soldiers ended up fighting each other.

 - He sowed dragon's teeth, as I recall. You can just throw them.


How do I get through the fog?

 - The game's hint suggests a question that is answered differently in
   different places.

 - 'Do I need to have my lamp on?' is a good question.

 - The answer to the question is 'Not here'.


What is the pentagram for?

 - Use it to imprison summoned beings.

 - You can imprison the London Dry Djinn in it.

 - Drop the flask here, then open it, then free the Djinn.


How can I get the starstone after I drop it?

 - It has strange spatial properties.

 - It's sort of in two places at once. One location (the one not where you
   drop it) is where it's real.

 - So when you drop it in the building, it's not really there. Note that
   you don't get points when you drop it there.

 - You need to drop it somewhere else outside.

 - Remember the wooden notice? The last word was 'starstone'.

 - Luckily, the Djinn will take care of the giant for you.


How can I get back past the basilisk?

 - Use the old mirror trick.

 - That metal plate ought to do fine.

 - But it needs polishing.

 - 'rub plate' while you're carrying the rags. Then carry the
   mirror past the basilisk.


How do I get out of the catacombs?

 - They're hard to map, since they change from game to game.

 - It works like this. The first time you go through the catacombs, any
   sequence of eighteen moves will get you back to 'Y2?'. That sequence
   determines the layout of the catacombs. When you reenter, you have to
   move the same way, or you end up kind of going backward. If you like,
   you can play around with dropping objects and see what I mean. I usually
   just go straight west the first time. Then I reenter, go west eleven or 
   twelve times, then wander around a little until I get to the portal.

 - After I leave the area past the portal, I just go straight west until
   I'm back at 'Y2?'.


How do I get the skeleton's sceptre past the bridge?

 - You need to leave it behind and get it later.

 - Leave it in the safe. You can also enter the safe from the room with 
   vaulted ceiling.

 - How do you open the safe? The game's hint suggests a skeleton key.

 - Use the magic word the skeleton gave you.

 - The word changes from game to game.  Make sure you use the right one.
   (There are four of them, and you'll need to know all four to finish
   the game.)


How do I learn all skeleton magic words?

 - You don't need them yet.

 - But you will.

 - Try wearing the crown.

 - Can't hear anything intelligible? Maybe you should try listening.

 - Just make sure you don't wind up dead.


What is the Djinn's word for?

 - It defeats dwarves. Of course, it also sometimes destroys your
   weapons and even gets you killed. Make sure you follow the Djinn's
   advice.


H. The End Game
---------------

The cave is closing! What should I do?

 - You should feel happy, since it means you've found all the treasures and
   are preparing to head to the end game.

 - Just wander around until the cave closes.


The cave has closed. What's going on here?

 - You need to get out of the repository.

 - Breaking the mirror doesn't work.

 - There's one kind of object here you haven't seen before.

 - The rods with red marks (not stars) are actually dynamite.

 - Blow up the northeast area.

 - Drop one of the red-mark rods in the northeast area, then go southwest,
   then 'blast'.

 - If you could get one of those lamps lit, you could go through the hole.

 - There's no way to light them.

 - Just ride the unicorn. 


I'm surrounded by gray mist. What do I do?

 - That's it! You've won!

 - Not really. You need to magic-word your way out of here.

 - There are sixteen magic words in the game. Note that 'plover' is a
   'travel option' -- it is not considered a magic word.

 - Just say them in the right order. The game will respond 'Ok.' after
   each one.

 - Remember the Djinn's story about Ralph Witt?

 - Ralph Witt liked the idea of reverse alphabetical order.

 - Say the words in reverse alphabetical order.

 - Still no luck? That's because the magic word given to you by the
   skeleton changes from game to game, and you need to know all its
   possible versions.

 - Perhaps you should have worn the crown, which you found in the safe.


I'm back at end of road again. What do I do?

 - First, you'll notice that the locations are connected backward.

 - There are other small changes.

 - The notice at the view has changed.

 - But it doesn't say anything useful.

 - The five-inch slit is now a five-foot slit.

 - Go ahead. Go on in.


I. Super Spoilers
-----------------

What are all the magic words?

 - I just can't bring myself to reveal them here. I think the hints in
   this file tell you all you need to find them, though. Remember, there
   are sixteen individual words, and 'plover' is not one of them.


What are all the treasures?

 - There are thirty-two treasures in all:

   bag of pieces of eight (beach)
   crown (safe)
   nugget (nugget of gold room)
   diamonds (west side of fissure)
   silver (N/S passage)
   jewelry (south side chamber)
   coins (west side chamber)
   treasure chest (dead end in maze of passages, all alike)
   nest of golden eggs (Giant room)
   trident (cavern with waterfall)
   helmet (Morion room)
   vase (Oriental room)
   emerald (plover room)
   sceptre (east end of Audience Hall)
   yacht (southern edge of reservoir)
   pyramid (Dark room)
   pearl (cul-de-sac)
   rug (secret canyon)
   spices (chamber of boulders)
   beads (balcony above treasure chamber)
   chain (barren room)
   spyglass (south end of Jonah room)
   sculpture (ice tunnels)
   bracelet (room with translucent walls)
   casket of opals (very small chamber)
   orb (cellar)
   tusk (bones room)
   chalice (recess in the beams)
   sapphire (living quarters)
   crucifix (thieves den)
   starstone (narrow basalt shelf)
   ring (created by player)
 

How do I get all the points?

 - Points are gained as follows:

    20 for getting into a dark area of the cave for the first time
    10 for getting to beach
    10 for getting to Sorcerer's Lair
    10 for getting to Valley of the Stone Faces
     8 for freeing Djinn
    15 for getting to Audience Hall
     7 for discovering each treasure (224 total -- Note that the tusk is
       not considered discovered until you drop it in the building.)
     8 for leaving each treasure in the building (256 total)
    16 shortly before 'cave closing' notice
    16 for getting 'cave closing' notice
    19 for getting to repository
    16 for getting to gray mist
    23 for getting to end of road in the end game
    16 for winning

   659 total? Oh, yes, the last lousy point...

     1 for getting magazines at Witt's End

   660 total. 

 - Points can be lost as follows:

    10 lost for reincarnation
    20 lost for taking a hint

###################################$adventure walkthrough
          rev. by Jessica Allan 08/02/97

This will RUIN the game for you.  Do not use it unless you
are truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your
life.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this
will ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even 
contains some of the ending.

This is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer's walkthrough, with 
better documentation and some improvements made.  

These commands will not work in every single game.  There 
are some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work
for the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 
point, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows
version does not conform to this, although the documentation
*may* be helpful.  

I highly recommend Rick Adams' page:
http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/
This contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an
FTP site providing source code and compiled versions for 
DOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.
Even with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due 
to some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to
compensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.

For those reasons, you cannot feed this through input 
redirection, although, if you're astute enough, you could 
probably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But
I doubt anyone would bother.

I can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure
on the Web at Stanford's machine:
http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html
That is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the
original format that was used, such as five letter packing
and such that was output from the other machine.  How close
this is to the original version, I can't say.
I recommend the Web version if you're running a 14.4 
connection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit
outdated anyway.

Enjoy playing, and I'm sorry I had to do this to you.  But
if it wasn't for this walkthrough, I never would have gotten
on with *my* life.  :)

 [+1 point for winning!]Tinseltown Blues walkthrough - by Eytan Zweig
---------------------------------------------

Note - this is a no-frills walkthrough of "Tinseltown Blues". It was written
for version 1.1. 

This walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is 
not an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores 
several non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions
to some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.

On the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant 
chunks, so it's more-or-less clear why you're doing what you're doing. This 
means that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it 
should be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game 
without necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section
I say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from 
beginning to end will know where to begin from.

Note that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, 
but others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will 
say so. 

A final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper 
building) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that 
period, you won't be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker's desk, 
which is randomly determined each game.

THE APARTMENT

You begin "Bullhockey!" in the upstairs bedroom of your apartment.  Of course you should read the crumpled note, which basically spells out your predicament--your girlfriend Natalie has apparently left, and you are without your work shirts, which you will need to return to work the following Monday (currently it's Wednesday), if only to re-establish some sanity or order in your life.  You won't immediately be able to get down the stairs, because Natalie seems to have returned, to look for her 'mojo' (her 'lucky charm'), and moved some bookcases to block the bottom of the stairway (it's a narrow staircase)--you'll learn this from the sticky note she left on one of the bookcases.  You won't be able to move them from where you are--you'll have to get down by some other means.  All you will need from the upper level here is your backpack, your notepad (SEARCH PILE--the one by the bed), and your walking stick (the staff--LOOK UNDER BED).  Make sure you always have these things, though there will be a few times where you'll  have to put them down.

This is a small, two-story apartment--the overhead fan is just over the banister from all locations on this upper level--but at different distances from each location.  It is also your ticket downstairs, but first, you'll have to turn it off.  The switch is on the fan itself, but you cannot reach it with your hands--you'll need the staff to turn it off with.  If you look at the fan from different locations, you'll see (or not) the switch from different angles.  The switch is on the side opposite from the Loft Bedroom--it is in full view from Stairs--but way too distant.  However, in Bedroom Entrance, it is much closer and you see it in profile--an ideal angle from which to HIT FAN SWITCH WITH STAFF.  Now you want to GET ON FAN, but not from Bedroom Entrance, because you also want something sturdy which will break your fall, when the fan detaches, and possibly reduce chance of injury--how about the train-safe refridgerator??  Go to Loft Bedroom and GET ON FAN (JUMP OVER BANISTER will also work, there).   You will now be able to MOVE BOOKCASES from downstairs--if you want.

You can now explore the apartment, if only to find some clue of where to start your mission.  Read the message on the mirror in the bathroom, take the binoculars, in the black case (these will be indispensible) from Natalie's bedroom. You'll find the key to her closet stuck in her chair cushions if you SIT IN NATALIE'S CHAIR or SEARCH NATALIE'S CHAIR.  You can look in her closet (SEARCH ART DESK to find the light switch for it), but that won't be useful until you find all the shirts.  When you leave Natalie's room, after getting the binocs--Surprise!--you find your office shoes!  Easy points!  Go to the Kitchen and look out the back window--see the odd flash of red?  LOOK AT ODD FLASH WITH BINOCULARS.  Now you have a sense of purpose.  You can go out the front door now, but be sure you're clear on which building the Red Shirt is on top of.  The building right in front of your back window, the one with the black trampoline on top, is Brockwood's Men's Store.  The building that has your shirt on top is the one directly across the street from it going due east--from Brockwood's and your back window (on the east wall of the apartment).  You just need to remember that it's across from Brockwood's.

THE RED SHIRT

- WALTER

Going north out the front gate from the parking lot, you go east to Center Street, then go south to get to Brockwood's.  You are free to do some exploring, but your destination is really the building across the street from Brockwood's.  It's the Vacant Building.  You can't climb up the building from the street; you'll have to go into the building--the main entrance is barred off--but there is another entrance--go south then east into the Gravel Lot--the entrance is north from here.  You'll have to find out how to get Walter to let you in.  Ask him some questions--ASK WALTER ABOUT MAGAZINE, ASK WALTER ABOUT HIMSELF, ASK WALTER ABOUT BUILDING, ASK WALTER ABOUT REHAB, ASK WALTER ABOUT LUNCH BOX--you can ask him about other things (even your Red Shirt), but the idea is to gain his trust by showing an interest in him and/or the building.  Then he will make a proposition--get him a 'drink' and he will let you in.  He will even tell you how to get the 'libation'.  You'll have to get it from Brockwood's!

- BROCKWOOD'S

Then you go into Brockwood's Store--he will take your backpack--don't worry, you won't need it here, and you'll get it back once you leave.  Go northwest to the Fitting Room.  Look in the mirror there--push the mirror, then voila, you can enter the back room (the locked door in the sales area leads to it, but you can't use that door).  There is a desk there, with a waste basket next to it.  You'll need to get into the large drawer, this is where Brockwood hides his booze.  (By the way, I encourage you to look at everything that seems interesting in this game!)  Look in the waste basket for the key.  Read the ledger that's in the drawer--to feel better about stealing his gin.  For an interesting excursion, try sitting in the swivel chair, and SPIN CHAIR.  You'll get the key to the hatch in the ceiling, to get on the roof--this will remind you of the trampoline that is there, and the location of the Red Shirt.  Though you don't really need anything up here.  Now go back down through the Fitting Room and into the store, with the gin bottle--surprisingly, Brockwood will allow you to leave with his bottle--he's really trying to give it up.

- THE BAIT AND SWITCH

But really, you have no intention of giving a bottle of real gin to an alcoholic.  The game won't let you!  You'll have to make Walter 'think' that it's real gin.  From Brockwood's Front, go south then west to Business Parking, then northwest to Brockwood's Nook--there's a water tap there.  POUR OUT the gin bottle, then TURN ON WATER TAP, and FILL BOTTLE WITH TAP.  Don't worry about opening or closing the bottle, that's automatic.  Then go back to Walter in Vestibule (SE, E, E, E, N) and give him the bottle.  He'll assume it's real because you obviously got it from Brockwood, he won't ask questions, he'll leave, giving you his nametag.  You can now enter the building, but there's one more item you'll need--go back out to Gravel Lot, go NE, and pick up the lantern there.  Now turn it on and you have light.  Now go through the Vestibule into the Cluttered Passage, you'll find the roll of duct tape and a newspaper page--which you'll want to look at (please take all take-able items, they will all fit in the backpack).

- THE SCIENCE LESSON

As you go into the Auditorium, you'll notice a hatch way up in the ceiling--it's open!  If you guessed that your Red Shirt is on the roof beyond this hatch, you're correct!  You'll need to figure out how to get up there.  The key is LEVERAGE.  The newspaper page gives some clue--you're going to put together something that will help you get up there--if only to get your shirt.  Try some things--turn on the spigot, turn it off, turn on the 'engine', turn it off--just to get a 'feel' of what you're about to do (Don't worry, Walter won't come back until after you 'do your thing' here, no matter how long it takes)--already there is what is called an Archimedean Screw, this is your base power source.  Now, go west into the Dim Front--you'll find a scaffold, examine it--better yet, look at it through the binoculars.  Now PUSH SCAFFOLDING EAST. The scaffolding has a yardstick on top, with a 5-gallon bucket tied to the end, and it's held down up there by a statue--a precarious balance--try to think of what would throw this balance off?  LEVERAGE.  Fill that bucket, and the statue will topple.  What can fill it--because you cannot reach it--??  The engine.  You'll need to PUSH SCAFFOLDING TO ENGINE.

So, how could the statue toppling be useful to you??  You could PUSH SEESAW TO SCAFFOLDING--but there's one more thing.  You might not get enough LEVERAGE to vault you through the hatch (and yes, you are going to be on the seesaw). TURN CRANK CW(or CLOCKWISE)--try both directions to get a 'feel' for how it works.  What happens?  A bathtub appears, suspended by a chain.  Look at it, better yet with the binocs.  You'll find that if you turn the crank CW, the bathtub gets nearer to the engine--CC(or COUNTERCLOCKWISE) makes it go the other direction.  You'll want the tub to be next to the scaffolding, so TURN CRANK CW until the tub almost buts up against the scaffolding.  Let the messages guide you.  Your final addition will be the seesaw--PUSH SEESAW TO STAGE EDGE--you don't want it to be directly under the tub.

Now, all you have left to do is put some energy through this system.  And you--the Artist--are going to be the vital fifth element.  Get your stuff together--everything in the backpack, close it up, put it on your back, put the staff through the straps.  You won't need the lantern beyond this room, so you can drop it here.  Now turn on the spigot, turn on the engine--you have a generous five moves to get on the seesaw.

Now let it sing!

If all went well, you are back in Kitchen--having gone through the hatch--but not before seeing Walter charge back in--snatched your Red Shirt, crossed the street (albeit in the air), bounced off of the trampoline and through your own back window.  You've come full-circle!  Don't worry about the police that are now in that Gravel Lot (Walter called them), just avoid it.  You'll get thrown in jail anyway, which will be part of this journey, but I'd rather you do that part last (but if you want to go ahead and do it, go to the Gravel Lot or the police station and get yourself arrested by either having Walter's nametag on you or giving the nametag to the sergeant at the station--then skip ahead to BOB AND ROGER, and come back when done).

You can continue exploring, but you won't be able to get anywhere without interacting with Jerry, the Barber.  So---

JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT

If you're wondering why he is groping around, you can either look at the pictures on the walls, or in the hallway to the east of his Shop area--or just ASK JERRY ABOUT GLASSES.  He'll tell you that he tripped on the curb and they fell off and 'bounced off somewhere'.  Go to Corner Curb and look in the grating--that's where the glasses are.  Jerry is a bit self-absorbed, so you're going to have to figure this one out without his (conscious) help.  Your utility key will not help you open the grating--you're going to need something sharper or flatter.  You may have noticed the screwdriver in the barber chair..??  Of course, you can't just take the screwdriver in the presence of its possible owner, so you'll have to engage in a little subterfuge.  GET IN BARBER CHAIR--you'll automatically put down your backpack and other stuff.  You'll be surprised when Jerry pulls out your White Shirt(!), using it as a bib.  You'll have to play along here, because you won't be able to just take the shirt just now, Jerry is a bit stubborn.  Let him cut your hair, but while you are on the chair, TAKE SCREWDRIVER.  When he's finished, you'll be out of the chair again and you'll need to give him the $10 bill--declining the $2 change as a courtesy to him (you won't need it).  Then go to Corner Curb and PRY GRATING WITH SCREWDRIVER.  Then open it and take the glasses.  Play around with them for a while if you want, but they are useless to you--and the world to Jerry.  Give them to him, and you get--a ticket to Bunco Springs Amusement Park(BSAP), down the street.  But not your shirt...

Go east from the shop, into the bathroom, if you haven't already.  There is a sheet in the hole in the ceiling--you'll see it when you LOOK UP.  It's the source of the draft.  You'll need to get this sheet down.  Neither the sink nor the toilet are sturdy enough to stand on, so you'll have to get on the shelf--with the towel bar to hold on to.  Take the magazine off of the shelf, then take the towel--you'll need something to replace the sheet with--then GET ON SHELF.  Now take the sheet and see what it really is.  It's a barber bib!  Now put the towel in the hole--you will automatically spread the towel over the hole.  Now you can go back into the shop area and give the towel to Jerry.  Now he's a happy camper!  Plus, seeing his error, he gives you your shirt back!  Now you have your White Shirt.  And you're ready for the park!

THE PARK

You can do more exploring again, if you want.  If you go to the Demolished Building further south past the park, you'll see a yellow streamer hanging from the flagpole.  Using the binocs, once again, you discover it's your Yellow Shirt!  You won't be able to get it, yet, because you don't yet have the means to do so, however the sign in front of the building gives you a clue.  Now you should focus on the park, and what you CAN do.  Remember the suggestion about getting your spirits up and perhaps a ride will do the trick...??  Though you are supposed to be 'afraid of heights', but now you are so depressed that you don't care.  Anyway, go in through the Amusement Park Entrance, and give the ticket to Chester in the ticket trailer.  Feel free to get to know Chester and how much of a jerk he is.  You can do some exploring around the park, and even see the demolished building from another angle, at the end of the 'nature path'--go into the hole in the tower, go up the stairs--you'll see the Thinker, and the skylight up top--that's where the flagpole is rooted.  You won't be able to open this skylight or remove it, but tuck it away in your memory.

And be careful not to leave the park until after you get results--and you'll know it when you've done it.

If you tried to get on the roller-coaster, you'll notice no one is there to start the ride, you won't be able to start it, so nix the idea for now.  Really, the only other ride is the Wonder Wheel, manned by our friend Rex.  If you're feeling really sneaky, go to his car in the parking lot and LOOK IN REX'S CAR--you'll get a white paper bag--there's some stale popcorn in it so he won't mind..?? (In fact, if you don't take the bag, and you do the Wonder Wheel, he'll leave for lunch in his car, leaving the bag behind.)  Feel free to ask Rex about anyone you've met so far, even about important things.  Ask him about the duck, in fact ask him about the popcorn.  Ask Rex about himself.  Now have your binoculars in hand--or wear them--so he can see them--then GET INTO WHITE CAR--he'll see your binocs and tell you he'll stop the wheel once you get up top--this is crucial, as it's an important vantage point, and you'll get only one chance to do this.  Once he stops the wheel, you'll notice something--what's that clinging to the nearer loop on the roller-coaster??  LOOK AT BLUE SPLOTCH WITH BINOCULARS--that's your Blue Shirt!!  You'll have 6 moves to do this before the wheel starts up again, and you are back on ground level.  Feel free to use the remaining time to look at other things around you, with the binocs.

Now, you can go to the Kiddie Pond, and give the popcorn to the duck--he gives you a gift.  TAKE ROCK.  Perfect for throwing.  You'll realize its use when you get on the Crock Blocker!

When you are on the platform for the Blocker, you have six cars to choose from.  This is important--if you get on the wrong car, too far forward, you won't be able to catch your shirt as it floats by when you are doing the second loop.  In fact, if you get on the yellow car, you're doomed, because the bar on it is loose--avoid it (devilish grin)--get on the rear car, #6.  Don't forget to DROP your stuff before getting into the car.  Now when you are in the car, throw the rock at the green lever, and let the ride begin!  You won't have to type a command, just let the ride do its thing, you've made the important choices and now just sit and enjoy.  You'll catch your Blue Shirt near the end of the ride.

But you won't be able to rest yet...

Hear the ticking noise..??

SEARCH CONTROL BOOTH.  Now you have an incendiary device in the shape of a pipe.  Time is important here.  Don't worry about the whats and whys now, you'll need to put the pipe where it won't be of any danger to anyone, but perhaps more importantly, where it would be of use to you.  In fact, I encourage you to play around with it, have some fun, try giving it to people, etc etc.  Take advantage of SAVE and RESTORE.  You have 20 moves to get this right.  Think back carefully about where this device might be of use.  Seen any demolished buildings lately??

And have you been in the tower?  Third floor?

More crucially, remember your Yellow Shirt?? It's on the flagpole at the top of the tower.  You'll need to get this --shall I say, bomb--up there.  You'll need to somehow attach it to the skylight, so it will work properly--just leaving it in the room won't be effective enough.  Got the tape?  PUT TAPE ON PIPE.  Now, PUT PIPE ON SKYLIGHT--it will stick.  Now, high-tail it out of there, fast!

BOOOMMM...

Now, you've got 15 moves to do this right....and pay attention to what goes on, particularly after the bomb goes off...if you don't see these things, you won't know why you'll need to do certain things, particularly Chester's movements, and the hawk that flies over--you'll see all this if you are back in the park in time to hear the blast from there. Chester will run out of the trailer to get a look, and at the same time, a hawk will fly over, with 'something yellow' in its beak.  You'll see the hawk deposit it on top of the trailer, realizing it to not be food.  Chester meanwhile will run to his car to contact--the police?--on his wireless.  You'll need to get into the trailer and do 2 things--1) get your shirt from out of the skylight, and 2) develop evidence against Chester, because he's certainly got a leg up on you.

First thing's first--you won't be able to get into the trailer from the front window.  You'll have to go to the back of it, via BSAP Parking(go SE from there, or S from Main Exit).  Look under the trailer for the key.  Unlock the door there and you are in.  Your Yellow Shirt is there in the skylight--take it.  Now look at what Chester has left behind--particularly the notebook.  Read it.  Now take it.  Now get out of there, and wait for the police to show up.

You'll figure out that Chester has opportunistically framed you for the explosion--you would have been accused whether you set the bomb or not.  His diary is your proof that he set that bomb, intending for it to go off after the first ride on the Blocker.  With his diary in hand, you'll be exonerated for this felony, and let go, with your Yellow and Blue Shirts.  But if you have the nametag on you--Walter's--they will arrest you and put you in jail for the destruction of the other building (unless you've already gotten yourself arrested--if so, and you 'got results', skip ahead to NAP TIME.  Otherwise, read on).

On the other hand, if you don't have the diary, the game will end with you being thrown into the Big Clink--not the one at the police station.

THE DRUNK TANK

Yep, you're in the 'pokey'.  Walter has got his revenge.  There's nothing you can do here, essentially, except talk--but you have another 20 moves to do it in.  Get a look at your cell mates.  You'll find that only one is really sleeping.  Look at the one in the blue jacket.  He's lying awake.  Look at his jacket.  You may wonder why he is clutching his jacket and shaking.  Is it DTs??  ASK BLUE MAN ABOUT ANXIETY.  He'll loosen up--then you get a surprise!  Your Green Shirt pops out!

But you won't be able to get it right away.  It seems to hold some meaning for him.  You'll need to verbally give him some proof that you should have the shirt.  TELL BLUE MAN ABOUT RED SHIRT(or any other shirt you've already gotten--you'll automatically tell him about Natalie and missing all of the shirts, etc).  How hard was that?  Now you can use the remaining time to get to know Bob and his friend, ask him some questions, about people and things, in the cell, etc.  When the time is up, you'll all be escorted out of the cell and back into town.  You'll see Bob and Roger again, in action, so to speak.

You can return to town by going north from here.  If you have all the shirts, read on from here.  If you got only the Green and Red Shirts, go back to JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT.  If you got only the Green, Red and White Shirts, go back to THE PARK.

If you have gotten all the shirts, you'll be prompted to go home and take a nap.  Follow the messages and clues once you get there.  This is where we segue into what is essentially Part II of the game.

NAP TIME

Go to Natalie's room and GET ON NATALIE'S BED, because you'll want to feel closer to her--and, you've always wanted to know how comfortable her bed is.  Read all the clues.  When you wake up, you'll see her diary(!) laying on the bed next to your head.  Don't worry, it'll disappear only if you try to take it while off of the bed, or if you take it and then leave the bed--and it will reappear when you get back on the bed.  The only thing you need it for is for a password, and how and where to use it.  So READ DIARY.  You'll only see the words inside the front cover--pay attention--the 'magic word' will be one of five possible words, all beginning with 'f'--fooble, forsnook, finsteeth, frotzle or frachet--it was chosen at random at the start of the game, so it can be different if you restart at this point--you will not be able to use one of these words, even if you make the right choice, by chance, without first seeing it in the diary--if you try, you'll get a snarky response (but try it anyway).  And take her advice--remember to 'whisper' it.

THE SECRET ALCOVE 

Where is the alcove?  It's not her Nook out in the Living Room.  Remember the closet?  You'll have to have the light on and go deeper inside it.  Now, WHISPER (the magic word you found in the diary).  Surprise!  Go into that area.  Now look around, do whatever you want, look at the cards, learn about tarot.  Pick up the card on top of the deck.  Look at the cards in the spread.  You don't have to do these things, but I encourage you to read and explore.  Really, the important thing here is the mojo.  In fact, while you are here, if you listen long enough, Natalie's voice will spell out your next mission--find her and bring her mojo to her!!  Take the mojo, then step back out.

THE INVITATION

As soon as you step back into her room, you'll hear something like an engine running outside, and knock at the door.  Answer it.  YOU got a package, for a change.  But also, the mail has arrived.  Take the black box, and then go check your mailbox.  You'll have to sift through the junk mail 3 times before finding the important thing--it's an invite to your boss's party--TODAY.  And you'll need to go in your dress shoes--which you haven't got yet (they're on the list!).  But you decide that they'll have to take you in your office shoes, so put them on.  Wonder what's in the box??  Open it and look into it!  AHH!  Natalie's been KIDNAPPED.  That is, if you haven't already figured this out.  You'll notice some other strange things about this box/sphere.  It seems to tug you in certain directions.  Follow that.  It'll take you down Lookout Avenue--and while you're going down there, feel free to explore and look at things.  You're going to be late, anyway, so take your time.  Examine Mabel Maybre's--your landlady's--mansion across the street from you, take a walk down the street, go on the south side.  Look at the end of the street, past your boss's house--particularly the property with the small house, fenced in.  Now go to the party...

THE PARTY

When you arrive, finally, you'll see most of your co-workers leaving--you don't need them.  Go up and knock on the door.  If you have your invitation--and the office shoes on--you'll be grudgingly admitted, don't worry, this is the only possible way to get in.  Now you can spend all the time you want talking--or trying to talk--to John, Rick, Scottie, look around, etc., but at one point Scottie will be prompted to leave, and John goes upstairs for a nap.  You can spend all the time you want doing whatever you want, but what you should do is first go into the dining room where Richard is, and read the note on the counter.  John found some shoes, and had them thrown to the dog.  Were they yours??  In any case, you feel resentful.

Indulge your curiosity.  When John went upstairs, he left the rope detached.  So go on up!  Don't worry, his wife cannot stay in one place very long, she won't catch you or notice you.  Follow the snoring.  Now you're in John's room.  Stay quiet.  Look in the closet--gotcha!  Look at things.  You'll need to take two things--really three--the key from the drawer in the nightstand, and John's shoes.  Yep, John's shoes.  Be quiet about it!

Now go back down and onto the patio.  What do we do with the shoes??  Remember the note on the counter??  Now do unto John as he has done unto whoever those shoes belonged to.  Could be you, maybe not.  But be careful not to throw them directly at Ruffy.  You see, the sphere is pulling towards the doghouse, and you want to go in there without Ruffy knowing.  So you want to distract him a little.  Is there a tree, or a fence, in the other direction??  THROW JOHN'S SHOES AT TREE, or THROW JOHN'S SHOES OVER SHORT FENCE.  He'll get right after them.

Now the party's over for you, you must now go into the doghouse--you can look around there if you want, but you have 5 moves to unlock the gate with the key you found in John's room--or face Ruffy.  Look at the 'mass' you find there--take it for the points.  Now go--go south, then take the curious object you find on the ground nearby.  You're now at the vacant property next door--if you explored around the Raditch House before you came to the party, you'll realize that this is the house that was fenced in.  The sphere tugs you strongly in this direction, then breaks from your grasp and busts against the cellar doors outside the house, as you approach.

Obviously, you should go down in there...

NATALIE...??

You find Natalie tied into a chair in this cellar.  But not too tightly, as you find out, if you try to cut her bonds--with the strange 'handle'--which is a switchblade (aren't they illegal now?).  You can take the bandanna out of her mouth, and then UNTIE NATALIE.  You'll find out that she's not too conversational--time is of the essence.  What was your mission?  To give her the mojo.  So do it!

But you just can't....

You can try.  In fact, you can try three times.  Or not.

Either way, about 15 or so moves after you free her, you'll find out that she's really...

MABEL!  Your landlady!  And she becomes a giant bird!

And that the small house and cellar were just a mirage!

Before you have any time to think, Mabel flies up and takes you with her.  Why couldn't she just take the mojo??  Because it would reject her grasp.  But there's something about that she NEEDS, and it needs to be willingly given to her by its owner--which is the REAL Natalie.

LOCKED UP, AGAIN?

You wake up in a jail cell, tied--this time much more tightly--to a chair, bolted to the floor.  In a dark, mildewy jail cell underground.  You cannot do anything, you cannot get up.  But wait, what is that in your back pocket (assuming that you did pick up that strange 'handle' back at the vacant property?)??  Push the little button on the handle in the back pocket--it's a switchblade!  Cut the ropes with it.  Now you can get up--to find out that the cell door isn't locked.  You can now leave the cell and go west into the main area--but also collect all of your things from the dungeon alcove just beyond the cell.  Don't worry, all Mabel is interested in is the mojo, which you are still wearing because she cannot take it off of you.  Is this a dungeon, or is it a gym??  Because you see all this exercise equipment laying around.  You'll find out for sure about 15 moves from the time you entered the Exercise Room before Mabel comes down to toture you--and the game ends. Try some of it out, if you want, but what you want to do is open the 'steam bath' and pick up the alabaster key from the floor inside it.  You'll need it later.  If you want some laughs, SAVE your position, and try some of the other equipment!

Now what you have left to do, here, is leave through the hatch overhead.  Now you are at Base of Mountain--pick up the plastic stick that you find there, it's a phosphorescent light stick--BREAK STICK for a light source.  You'll need to go east over to the oak tree fast--you have 5 moves from the time you emerged from the hatch before Mabel spots you.  Once you get to the tree, you won't have to worry about Mabel again--for now.

NIGHTSCAPE

Now from Tree Base, the only way you can go is UP.  You can wear the light stick on your wrist, and put everything you have in your backpack, wear it, and then WEAR STAFF (in case you haven't yet found out, the staff can be slid through the straps and worn in this way).  Now go UP the tree.  You are immediately presented with three branches going in northerly directions--north, northeast and northwest.  Which one is correct??  You can try them if you want.  But look around.  There is a hollow behind you--look into it!  There, you find a leather whip!  Read the tag--'From the One That Got Away'.

Also, there's another branch--overhead.  SWING WHIP AT STRONG BRANCH.  Then SWING ON WHIP.  Bombs away!!

Your way from here is pretty well cut and dried--you're on the other side of the fence, so you can follow the path around the mountain, and then into the cave--which is a tunnel that goes into the heart of the mountian.  Now go into the door--after picking up the piece of paper lying there.  Now you are in a strange place...

BLACK AND WHITE

This is just an abstract piece of interactive fiction that I decided to write into the game...

Now you are in the center of a perfectly white room with a huge black dot--there is even a sign indicating where you are!  If that's not enough, the piece of paper you have also has a huge black dot--this is a map, of sorts, showing you where you are.  Again, you can walk around, examine, explore all you want.  Use the white key that you got from the exercise room to unlock the white door, go into the room with the desk and examine the huge book that you find there--it's a ponderous tome written by Rene Decartes.  What is perhaps his most famous saying?  'I think, therefore I am'.  So we come to the one thing you need to do here.  Think.  But you need to do this in the right place.  Go where you feel most 'centered'--on The Dot.  Now--guess.  

THINK.

ON THE MOUNTAIN

Now you are on the terrace near the top of North Mountain.  Don't worry about getting off the mountain or back where you were.  And don't worry--yet--about Mabel.  Examine the fire--what's in it?  You have about 5-7 moves to take your nametag from the flames.  That's the last thing on your list!  You get the points.  Put the nametag on, because it's an important identity symbol.  Now you can look around and examine things there on the terrace.  Specifically, examine the hole on the side--what do you notice just over the side, near the hole?  A cave entrance, on a lower level.  You'll need to get down there.  How?  It's a precarious climb, and there are no hand-holds.  Seven symbols of your identity will be needed to help you climb down there.  You're already wearing one--the nametag--as a sort of bolster to your courage.  Now, what do you have that can fit into the hole?

Your staff.  PUT STAFF IN HOLE.

Now, you're going to have to make a rope--with the remaining five things.

The shirts.  It doesn't matter what order you tie them in, you can do it this way--TIE RED SHIRT TO WHITE SHIRT.  TIE BLUE SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE YELLOW SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE GREEN SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  Or however.

Now you have a long rope.  Obivously, you can TIE ROPE TO STAFF.  Voila!

Remember to be wearing your nametag before you go.  Now, DOWN....

You are now in front of the cave entrance, on a narrow ledge.  The only way to go is into the entrance, south.

You find--NATALIE!--but she's lying down with her hands tied.  She notices you--listen to her--she IS the real Natalie.  Cut her bonds with the switchblade--you won't be able to untie the leather string.

Another surprise!  (And don't worry, you did everything correctly up to here.)

Now you have TWO Natalies!  Is this a good thing??  No, because one of them is Mabel!

Now ask either one of them anything!  Try anything!  Have fun!  You won't be able to tell which one is which, no matter what you do or ask--but listen to what they say.  The crucial thing is knowing which one to give the mojo to.  After about 20 moves from the time you freed the real Natalie, one of them will say something interesting.  Remember the 'magic word' from earlier?  She will say that word, to which the other will say 'Oh bullhockey, honey, don't listen to her!  She's nuts!'  Which ever one, the Natalie on the left, or the Natalie on the right, that said the 'magic word' is the one that you should give the mojo to!  (Like the magic word, which Natalie is the correct one is not necessarily the same in each complete game playing.)  Now watch the pyrotechnics!

GETTING HOME

Natalie has now flown you both back down to the ground, but beyond that point, she is not exactly going to hold your hand on the way home.  Really there is only one route you can go--she will not let you turn back.  Listen to her as you pass the Goblins, Inc. shop--an important suggestion.  You are now on Center Street--but now it's night time and you are heading south to the corner at Rex's--you've been here before, but just during the day when it wasn't so active.  Now turn west--you are now at the Alley Entrance, again.  You see two pairs of feet sticking out of the alley--EXAMINE FEET, for another surprise!  It's your two buddies from the jail cell!  Natalie looks none too patient, but she'll need to wait for a bit, because this is a very important encounter--a key conversation.  You have 20 moves to tell them about the right things.

They want to know how your quest is going.  Now TELL BOB ABOUT one of the following--Natalie, Mabel, the kidnapping, the shirts, the rescue.

Bob will then 'confer with his cohort' and in moments, this results in him donating their jackets to you and Natalie.  You get Bob's jacket, because, with your bald pate, you look more like him, and Natalie gets Roger's jacket--and she gets the fedora--with her hanging on your neck, this makes you two look like the two of them, with Bob toting Roger to their lodgings for the night, at the apartments.

Now all you have to do is get home.  Literally.  Continue west to Lookout Avenue Apartments, go south into the gate, and go back to the apartment.  Your disguise fools the giant bird hovering around the mountain to the north, until the hat blows off of Natalie--just as you get inside the gate.  Then Mabel spots her and as the two of you start running, the gate begins to close.  Crazy Mabel doesn't notice this, as intent as she is, and just as she swoops down, the gate closes!  Game over for her!

And for you.

Thank you for playing my game, and as the ending says, look out for 'Bullhockey 2!"This is a walkthrough for Cold As Death, by Gorm. 

At the time of the walkthrough creation, this game could be played at

Since actions are timed, you have 20 seconds between run or jump
actions; if you don't take one of these actions every 20 seconds, you'll
freeze to death. So if you're a slow typist, you may want to add "jump"
as needed.

Het doel van het spel is om een grote schat te vinden.

Het verhaal  begint in je eigen huis. Daar kun je een briefje 
oppakken. In het briefje staat hoe je de commando's in kunt 
typen. Als je door het raam klimt, zul je de schep vinden. Als 
je naar je slaapkamer gaat, zul je een kleine, brandende 
lantaren vinden. Het is ook mogelijk om een tukje in je bed te 
doen. Verder is hier nu nog niets te doen, dus ga weer terug 
naar de kamer. In het oosten is een hal, waar een sneetje 
brood, een fles melk en een munt liggen. Ook staat er een 
mooie houten kist. Als je de kist beter bekijkt, zul je een 
vreemde inscriptie ontdekken. Misschien is het handig als je 
die inscriptie even opschrijft. Misschien ook niet.

Nu kun je je huis verlaten en naar buiten gaan. Je staat dan 
midden in het dorp, en je ziet de herberg en in de verte een 
groot, eng kasteel. Ga de herberg binnen. Ga zitten en luister. 
Je zult een aantal gasten horen praten. Luister dan nog een 
keer en de gasten zullen opstaan en ergens anders gaan zitten. 
Als je weer bent gaan staan, wil je natuurlijk de knoflook 
hebben. Maar je mag het niet pakken van de waard! De oplossing 
is dat je intypt "koop knoflook". Dan zal de waard het gewoon 
aan je geven. Typ dan "vraag waard" en hij zal je een trap 
naar de zolder laten zien. Ga naar de zolder. Daar tref je een 
kist aan die onder het stof zit. Blaas het stof weg, en er 
komt een oud boek te voorschijn. In dit boek staat hoe je 
vampiers kunt doden. Bekijk de rare steen ook eens goed... Je 
kunt ook het bloed op de grond onderzoeken, maar daar wordt je 
niet veel wijzer van. Ga weer naar beneden in de herberg. Als 
je in een agressieve bui bent, kun je de waard in elkaar 
slaan, maar na een paar keer zal hij je doden en moet je 
opnieuw beginnen. Daarom is het handig als je het spel even 
opslaat voordat je hem gaat slaan. Dit doe je door 'bewaar 
spel' in te tikken. In de herberg is nu voorlopig niets meer 
te doen, dus we gaan naar het bos.

Als je weer buiten staat, ga dan het bos in. Nu moet je even 
ronddwalen (ga west, ga noord etc.) tot je bij een boomhut 
komt. Hier kun je de voetafdrukken bekijken, en dan in de boom 
klimmen. In de hut zul je een kapmes en een houten wig vinden. 
Ga weer omlaag, en probeer voor de grap eens in de boom te 
snijden.

Ga dan het bos weer uit door weer op goed geluk allerlei 
richtingen op te lopen. Nu gaan we maar eens een kijkje nemen 
in het kasteel!!

Als je het bos weer uit bent, ga dan naar het noorden en naar 
het kasteel. Als je een andere richting neemt, kom je weer in 
het bos. Als je voor het kasteel staat, kun je de tekst boven 
de ingang lezen en dan naar binnen gaan. Binnen zul je een 
harnas aantreffen. Als je erin wilt kruipen, moet je "trek 
harnas" intypen. Als je daarna "kijk vizier" typt, zul je 
vreemde dingen zien. Trek het harnas dan weer uit, want je 
kunt er nu nog niet mee bewegen. Je kunt het wel meenemen, 
maar laten staan voor later is ook goed. Je kunt namelijk 
maar een beperkt aantal spullen meedragen. Je moet dus goed 
opletten waar je dingen laat, zodat je ze later weer kunt 
ophalen als je ze nodig hebt. 

Er is hier een deur, maar als je daar door loopt, kom je in 
een kamer waar verder niets is te doen. Er is hier alleen 
een lange tafel met etensresten. Ga de kamer uit, en loop de 
trap op. Je staat voor slaapkamer 2, maar de deur is niet 
open te krijgen. Als je naar het westen gaat, kom je bij 
slaapkamer 1. Als je die ingaat, kun je naar een balkon. Als 
je daar van af springt, ben je dood. Ga slaapkamer 1 weer 
uit, en loop weer naar het oosten. Je bent dan weer bij 
slaapkamer 2. Ga nu de nauwe gang zuidwaarts in. Je kunt 
hier verschillende kanten op. Als je de wenteltrap omhoog 
gaat, kom je in de kasteeltoren. Hier is een kist met een 
gesloten luik. Nu kun je die nog niet openen. Ga door het 
raam en je zult een waterbron in de verte zien. Vanaf nu kun 
je bij die waterbron komen in het bos. Ga weer omlaag en dan 
nog een keer omlaag. Je staat nu voor een geheimzinnige deur, 
waarop gebonkt wordt. Ook deze deur kun je nu nog niet 
openen. Als je weer omlaag gaat, kom je op de begraafplaats. 
Als het goed is, is hier een lange ladder. Neem die mee. Je 
kunt eventueel nog door het poortje gaan, om bij de graven 
te kijken. Ga weer door het poortje en ga omhoog. Ga nogmaals 
omhoog en zet dan de ladder neer, die zal tot het gat reiken. 
Klim de ladder op en je bent in de spionageruimte. Ga naar 
het oosten. Je kunt nog verder naar het oosten, maar daar 
loopt de gang dood. Ga terug en ga door het gat omlaag. Je 
komt in een ventilatieruimte, waar je verder niets kunt doen. 
Ga weer omhoog en twee keer naar het westen. Ga dan omhoog de 
uitgehouwen trap op en kijk door het gat. Je zult Dracula 
zien die in een kist stapt. Als je nog een keer kijkt zie je 
een dichte kist staan. Klaarblijkelijk zit Dracula daar in, 
maar vergis je niet. Als je weer naar beneden gaat via de 
ladder zul je hem tegenkomen. Je kunt proberen hem te slaan, 
schoppen of doden, maar dat haalt niets uit. Hij zal je 
altijd doodbijten. Nee, de truc is dit: typ "schijn dracula", 
en gooi dan de knoflook. Dracula zal met een plof verdwijnen, 
maar hij is nog niet dood!

Neem de ladder mee en ga nu het kasteel weer uit, - let op! 
De deur valt nu dicht en kan niet meer open!- en ga naar het 
dorp. Je kunt nu naar de waterbron. Gooi de duivelaarsmunt 
in de waterbron, en vul de fles met het giftige, blauwe 
water dat nu is ontstaan. Je kunt de munt ook weer meenemen 
als je dat wilt. Als je behoefte hebt om nogmaals op de 
zolder van de herberg te kijken, dan kan dat. Maar de waard 
zal je er niet langs laten. Als je hem de munt geeft, wordt 
hij weer wat rustiger en kun je op zolder kijken. Hier is 
echter nog steeds niets te vinden. Ga weer naar je eigen 
huis en naar de slaapkamer. Als je nu gaat slapen, zul je 
midden in de nacht wakker worden door gebonk onder je bed. 
Schijn met de lamp onder je bed en je ziet een open luik 
zitten. Ga omlaag door het luik. Je zult een doosje en een 
bijl aantreffen. Open het doosje en je vind een hamer. Pak 
de bijl en ga weer omhoog. Ga naar het bos en zoek weer naar 
de boomhut. Hak nu met de bijl een stuk hout uit de boom, 
en raap dat op. Snij nu met het mes in het hout en het zal 
de vorm van een kruis krijgen. Je kunt voor de lol met de 
bijl ook huis gaan houden in de herberg. Als je de bijl 
gooit zal de waard hem weer terug smijten enz.

Ga weer naar je huis en zet de ladder neer onder het gat 
boven je. Beklim de ladder en pak het touw dat daar ligt. 
Ga weer omlaag, neem de ladder mee en ga naar je slaapkamer. 
Kruip weer door het luik onder je bed. Pak de hamer en 
graaf met de schep naar het noorden tot je op iets hards 
stoot. (De bijl heb je overigens niet meer nodig, evenals 
het mes, de lamp en de knoflook. Zorg dat je in ieder geval 
de hamer en de wig hebt, het touw en de fles met giftig 
water.) Duw  de steen weg en ga door het ontstane gat. Je 
bent nu weer in het kasteel en je stuit op de doodskist van 
Dracula. Open de kist en de klok zal twaalf uur slaan door 
je pc speaker. Dracula opent de ogen en zal wegvluchten. 
Typ nu telkens "volg dracula", totdat hij niet verder gaat 
en hij voor je komt staan. Tijdens je achtervolging zul je 
merken dat je nu wel door het luik kunt gaan van de kist, 
die eerst dicht zat. Je komt dan in slaapkamer 2 waar je 
eerst niet in kon. Maar goed, Dracula staat op het punt je 
weer aan te vallen. Als je de knoflook en de lamp nu zou 
gebruiken haalt het niets meer uit. Nee, nu moet je het 
houten kruis tonen. Dracula zal angstig tegen de muur 
opkruipen en de handen voor zijn ogen slaan. Sla dan de wig 
met de hamer door zijn hart en Dracula is dood!!!! Zijn 
lijk zal tot stof vervallen en je kunt nog net het woord 
'incoronium' lezen. Vergeet ook niet om de gouden halsband 
op te rapen die hier ergens ligt.

Ga nu naar de kamer waar stond "Dit is Sesam". Typ nu de 
toverspreuk in die het lijk van Dracula achterliet en de 
deur zal opengaan. Je komt nu oog in oog te staan met een 
gevaarlijke spin. Ook hier kun je proberen haar te doden maar 
dat lukt niet. Je moet de fles met giftig water kapot gooien. 
De spin zal dan het water opdrinken en sterven. Als je 
rondkijkt, zie je een vuur in deze kamer. Als je er doorheen 
loopt, ga je dood. Je zult het harnas aan moeten trekken. 
(Als je het niet bij je hebt, moet je het gaan halen) Je zult 
merken dat je je nu opeens wel kunt bewegen in het harnas. 
Loop door het vuur heen en je komt in de geheime schatkamer. 
Hier staat een kist vol met gouden munten. Als je de kist 
oppakt zal het kasteel gaan schudden en beven. Het wordt tijd 
dat je je uit de voeten gaat maken.

Als je weer terug bent gegaan door het vuur, moet je naar de 
plek waar de doodskist van Dracula stond. Gooi alle voorwerpen 
die je bij je hebt weg, en pak de doodskist op. Ga nu naar 
slaapkamer 1 en naar het balkon. Knoop daar het touw vast, ga 
omlaag via het touw en zet de doodskist neer. Kruip nu in de 
doodskist en je zal met kist en al van de heuvel afglijden, zo 
het dorp in. Als je weer uit de kist bent gestapt heb je het 
spel uitgespeeld. Je kunt nu gaan genieten van al je geld. 
Hoewel. Er lopen nog meer mannen rond in lange, zwarte 
jassen...

NB: Het is mogelijk bepaalde handelingen in een andere volgorde 
te doen, en voorwerpen op andere plaatsen te laten etc.

Note, while this will get you from beginning to end, you'll need to do
considerably more EXAMINEs and LOOKs if you want to enjoy the full
effect of the game. Also, most of the timed puzzles are unforgiving of
any errors, so if you make a mistake, be sure to undo right away (or you
can wait to see the death first). Save frequently.

FUN NOTES:
All purpose Gunk - fix leak in the dam from pushing the Blue Button
the Coffin - you can carry it out across the ravine and down the slide, or you can visit the room, and let the thief transport it all the way to his hideout - YEAH!  Turn the tables and make the thief work like a dog before you slit his throat. (After all, your crimes are quickly adding up:  trespassing, breaking&entering, stealing, killing, and probably caused massive flood destruction downriver too!)

This faux "Granite Wall" has no use...others might, but as the InvisiClues for Zork I stated, "Evidently the ancient Zorkers did not have strong truth-in-advertising laws. Take nothing for granite." 

Who is that Ugly Person staring back at me in the MIRROR room?
ARAGAIN Falls  -->  Backwards?  NIAGARA

Have you ever:
 - read lettering (in the Living Room)
 - look at blue cake through flask (and others)
 - eat the different cakes!
 - examine the portrait of Flathead, and the bills, coin, stamp
 - try digging with the shovel in the bat guano 
 - try to keep digging on the sandy shore
 - get in the barrel and say "GERONIMO" over the falls
 - wave stick again while walking on the rainbow
 - try to take the bat
 - walk into stinky room with torch
 - the water can also be used to cool the bell if you need to ring it again
 - examine stamp (Balloon area)
 - try floating to the top of the volcano
 - read the card after detonating explosives
 - look into any sphere (after you've put all 3 in the case!!)
 - IF YOU DIE... maybe pray at an altar for forgiveness?
 - in the temple... you can go to the treasure room:  TREASURE
 - opened the grating from beneath while the leaves were still on it?
 - tried swearing?
 - tried anything mean to the bodies in Hades?
 - burned the black book?
 - damaged the painting?
 - lit the candles with the torch?
 - read the matchbook?
 - play violin / play violin with sword
 - tried to take yourself (or the Thief, Troll, or Cyclops)?
 - tried cutting things with the knife or sword?
 - poured water on something burning?
 - said WAIT or SCORE or PRAY while dead (as a spirit)?
 - count (blessings, matchbook, candles, leaves, bills)
 - examine me
 - brush teeth
 - brush teeth with gunk (open tube and take gunk)
 - oil sword with water
 - make wish (at top of barrel with coins in hand)
 - attack cretin with sword
 - poke cyclops
 - send for brochure after you already get the stamp
 - burn brick, leaves, wire, bills
 - JUMP (from top of well)
 - kick the bucket (ie. the well)  haha
 - attack master with sword (ENDGAME)
in DREARY ROOM
  > look through window  
    The door is open, dummy.
 
Words you may not have tried:
  HELLO (by itself, and also to Cretin, Troll, Thief, Cyclops and objects)
  OIL (lubricate)
  XYZZY
  PLUGH
  ZORK
  DUNGEON
  SKIP
  FIND (especially with house, hands, teeth, cretin, grue)
  CHOMP
  COUNT (treasure, blessings, matchbook candles, leaves, bills)

  BACK
  FROBOZZ
  SCHEDULE
  TIME
  DIAGNOSE

NOTE:  In some versions, the elvish sword can be referred to as "Glamdring" or "Orcrist"  

DON'T FORGET - type "score" once you get the full 616 points!

EXITS from UNDERGROUND:
1.  Trap Door (Cellar)
2.  Chimney  (Studio)
3.  Grating  (Maze - unlock with rusty keys)
4.  Pray     (Altar)
5.  Hole in Living Room Wall (Strange Passage)
6.  Over the Rainbow (Climb back up the Canyon)

LAMP BATTERIES:  Lasts about 325 turns

BALLOON RIDE:  The guidebook burns longest... otherwise you will need to burn a few different items (newspaper, leaflets, labels, brochures).

ENDING TEXT:
[Treasury of Zork] This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste. To judge from its contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.

There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.

In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and other informative and inspiring works.

On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground Empire, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure, and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.

On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.

As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon Master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things. Long have I waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!" He taps you lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells, and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped. For a moment there are two identical images staring at each other among the treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

Bravo, vous avez termin Ekphrasis !Enchanted Castle (enchcast.zip)
----------------

You started in a medieval castle without any knowledge about it. You are to
escape the castle. There are three missions you might also want to do to
complete the wholestory of this beautiful text adventure game.

Walkthrough:
East: One of the torch is not firmly attached. Get it. This would be your
      only light source
West: Great Hall. There is a magic word written here. Some other areas
      would bring you back to here whenever this magic word is spoken.
      There are also other magic words. To distinguish it, we would refer
      this as return magic word.
Up,Up: There is a painting here.
      Try to get it. Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west
West: Prison cell
      There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them
      appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.
      You are trapped. But don't worry, you have the return magic word.
      so... You are back to Great Hall

Try to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,
and east where you can light it again. If you come to a place where there
is a sign "Abandon Ye..." on the west door then north, south, and west would
allow you to pass the west door. If you are ready then:
1. Passing the Bengal tiger
   Go to music room, get oboe, go to wine-cellar room, wash oboe, back to
   menagerie, play oboe. You put him on sleep
2. Clearing the vines in greenhouse
   Go to rotunda, west, west, west. There is a block with blood dripping on
   it. It is mentioned that there are doors to eastern. So there are actually
   three doors. Go to south east to torture chamber. Get secateur. Go to
   green house. Cut vines
3. Passing the dragon
   From green house, north, east, enter crypt. There is a candle here. If
   your torch is unlighted, light it. Now, the southern wall has three doors.
   Choose the one which appears to be safe (remember). Don't forget to
   adjust the orientation. Inside, there is an armor. Get it.
   There is also a magic word to save your game here.
   Return to Great Hall. Go to rotunda, southwest, south. See the candles?
   Blow them. The fireplace to the west open. West, West, Get sword,
   Go to the hall of dragons. Wear armor. Kill dragons
4. To get to other part of castle
   Go to theatre, west, north, north. Sit on a strange chair. You are
   transported to other room.
5. Looking for keys?
   Go to gazebo, get ladder. Transport to the other part of castle. Go to
   cruciform, north. Drop ladder, climb up ladder and you would find a
   statue there. Get statue but don't break it. Down, south, and west.
   You are standing on balcony above the terrace. Throw statue. Smash!
   Return to Great Hall, Go to terrace. Get a set of keys.
6. Passing basilisk
   Go to lord bedroom. Open closet. Now, a basilisk is hiding there.
   Run, You would be safe if you don't run to the room where you come in or
   you don't run to a dead end. To get rid of it, from lord bedroom, north,
   north (cruciform), east. There is a magic word that whenever is spoken
   somewhere else, everything there would be disappeared. So south, and say
   the magic word.
7. Fetching the Star of diamond
   Bring the set of keys with you. Go to lord chamber, south, down until
   you come to the nursery room, west. Notice the furnace? unlock it,
   open it, and you can get the Star
8. Exploring rooms behind hall of dragon
   Go to catacomb east of it. Southeast. Northeast. Keep trying to go to
   northeast until you found a bridge. Cross it. You would find a chained
   troll. If you have the keys with you, unlock it. He would steal the
   keys from you. Unless you have had the star of diamond, you won't need
   them anymore. East, north, west on the edge of a pit. Down. You entered
   a Zimbu house (This one too is just like the basilisk will be after you).
   So grab the book fast. Up, south, south, cross the bridge and burn it.
   There the Zimbu can't swim
9. Rescue the princess from ugliest witch

   the liquid, you would find that there is a room below. So wave the wand.

   to the Great Hall, go to hall of dragon, go to catacomb east of it,
   northeast to a river. Fill flask with mineral water. Back to the well
   and pour the water. Listen the magic word carefully
12.Passing the Bengal tiger again
   With wand, go to kitchen, south, and wave it. Presto! delicious food
   appears. Get it. Go to menagerie. Feed tiger
13.Opening your way out
   Get the secateur. Transport to other part of castle. A large mirror is
   standing there. Break it. It allows you to go south, south where you
   find a windlass. This one is used to raise and lower the drawbridge below.
   The windlass is stuck however, so cut the rope. Snap! the drawbridge
   fall down. you are not done yet, need to raise the locked portcullis.
   Back to Great Hall, bring the bell with you, go to menagerie, northeast
   to the room of three. Ring the bell three times. A unicorn would let you
   to take a golden key from it. Go to the entrance, unlock portcullis and
   say the magic word from the well.
14.Last thing
   You have the star diamond and the princess now. You also has opened the
   gate. The last thing is to demolish the castle. Now, go to reception room
   where there is a chandelier is swaying around. Light chandelier. Go to
   stable, burn hay. Oops, you drop your torch. Don't attempt of getting it.
   Instead, run east, east, south, west, south, south to finish this
   incredible game

wangsawm@prism.cs.orst.eduFallacy of Dawn Walkthrough
By Natalie Charlesworth
You are Delarion Yar. Like Case in Neuromancer, you were a brilliant hacker until some thugs caught up with you, knocked you out, scrambled inside your brain and left you alone in an urban wasteland. Today Yars working at FunTime Mall, in the arcade, and getting through a ree hangover.
X games
X Bomberman for a hint for later
T mallrat (pick any number, I normally go for the polite option)
X customer
T customer when he talks to you
My numbers: 2, 3.
T customer when he starts kicking Mr Do! This will trigger an event. If you try to leave the arcade to get help, it will be too late.
Now you know theres a bomb in Crystal Castles and you need a saw. When you told the customer off for kicking Mr Do!, you mentioned you were fixing it. So, SEARCH Mr Do! 
Take the saw.
X Castles- Its locked at the top.
Cut lock with saw
Open Castles
X Bomb- red and white wires (remember Bomberman)
Cut white wire with saw
Now Benji, your soon former-boss will arrive. 
T Benji
No matter what you say, the git will fire you because he values the insurance money over the games and safety of his customers and staff. No need to be polite.
N
X poster if you like
Go North until you reach Rygarr Avenue.
W
W
Go North on Boggit Street, until you read On the west is Sunrise Sushi. 
Go west to meet your charming friend Porn and get some food. 
T Porn- Any number is fine, but I tend to use 1,3 or 4 as youll be asking 2 (Whos Draper) the next time to you talk to him
G
EAT SUSHI
You can try asking Porn Whos dealing? when thinking of ways to bring in an income, but you dont have much time to T DEALER and EAT REE, especially as you put it in your pill case automatically and have to take your case, open your case, take ree and then eat it. 
Clara will show up. You dont remember this girl, but you both have obvious chemistry.
You can say anything you like to Clara, but I prefer to leave You dealing? out of the conversation. Shes a bit hurt that you cant remember her, but knows you clearly like her anyway. Normally you pass out for a short time.
T CLARA
T PORN when hes finished telling an irritating bugger named Glavine off, to go through all ways of earning an income in a city like New Haz.
When Johnny Dapper arrives and announces his bounty on your head, talk to Porn or Clara immediately. No time for questions, focus on getting out of there. Clara will give you her house keys and distract Dapper.
E to leave Sunrise Sushi.
Go North until you read To the east is a small townhouse complex. This is Claras house.
E
You can look around the place and wait until you hear an awful noise from the intercom.
Press blue button to let Clara in.
T Clara: 1 is a good option.
Z (Clara is off to have a shower)
Z
T Clara
Be a gentleman. When it comes to sleeping arrangements, volunteer to sleep on the beanbag. So, 2 is best.
You get rewarded by Clara waking you up later. 
Kiss her. You can do so again, the dialogue continues. When it stops, make love to Clara.
When you both wake up, why not to talk her about the painting?
Soon enough, two thugs will arrive and give you 24 hours to pay back another debt, not related to Dapper at all. You cant attack them, you can only TALK TO LARGE THUG as he shoots his partner to make a point. How rude, Claras door and carpet are ruined.
No matter what you say, hes only there to warn you so you wont be attacked. Youll wait for Porn to arrive and Clara to get ready. I dont know which verb makes you help Porn in trying to put the wrecked door back on the hinges, sadly.
Going North, North, East to Pizza Zoo is only for you to eat a slice, hear Clara and Porns ideas for how to get started in making money and ask Porn what an upper-decker is if you really want to know. Hes a good friend, is Porn, but he has no taste.
Well be stopping off at your place (Boggit Street, at the very top near the Copbot) and Porns apartment (the apartment on Main Street). I tried going to Porns place to pick up the honey jar before going to the pizza shop, but theres no use. Pick up your backpack and credit card, as thats where your earnings will be transferred.
If you like you can go to the CopBot at the end of the road near Coffman, and E and N to Kim Street for the weapons store if you havent played before. You will soon know you need a weapon to enter the rest of New Haz and the price of the three guns available from the cheery people at the weapons store.
Go down Boggit Street, Rygarr Avenue and Main Street to Academy Videos. Your friend Tericho is there, fuming about being ripped off by a rude guy named Adrian Bates inside.
This is a long slog with a random generation of bargain games. Save before you go in, you may get on a loop of the same wonderful game and this will make progressing impossible.
PUT ALL IN BACKPACK
TAKE GAMES to as much as you can hold.
X each game name will give Yars accurate review of it so you know which ones to GIVE TO CLERK so he can snigger himself to death.
These are some of the bad ones that will make the uppity twerp eventually laugh himself into unconsciousness: Batman, Outpost, Night Trap, Reloaded, Tekwar, Tetris (relatively), Trespasser, Shadows of Cairn, Custers Revenge, E.T., Dominion, Madden 97, Saied, Fork in the Tale, Sinister Six, World War II : On-Line, Crime Wave, Force Commander.
To make things easier, put the good games in your backpack so youre less likely to pick them up again from the bargain bin. They have no further use- selling is not an option as the pawn shop doesnt have staff, and you wont be able to play them. Drop them if you like after Bates is sprawled on the ground.
Take Adrian Bates card and give it to Porn get the register money transferred to your card. You cant give Tericho the money he was owed, but hes satisfied with your revenge.
Now, we have our money. Lets go and get the electric pistol- the only weapon we can afford right now. Getting more deadly weapons is optional, but would probably make combat easier. Truth be told, only the electric pistol can be reloaded at the Ammobot, so no playing with bullets as you only get five. X PISTOL to get an idea if you need it reloaded.

MAKING MONEY IN NEW HAZ MADE EASY
Go to see Trotskie on Coffman Avenue. Hes running a D&D game with your other friends that Porn will rudely interrupt, but hell tell you that the morgue needs people to claim their corpses as theres too many. Talk to your other friends too if you like.
At the morgue, there is a Creepy Guy in a porcupine suit. Claim your brother, and go west to check. When you come back out, Glavine will be trying to ruin things for you. You can tell him off, and then continue talking to the Creepy Guy to get your money. As tempting as it is to hit Glavine, theres no point.
Clara gets an idea to retrieve a film for the museum curator on Konrad Street. The theatre on Holden Street stole the film, so lets go there. No way to get in except:
ATTACK WINDOW WITH PISTOL
S (make sure the cop doesnt see you)
N 
ENTER WINDOW
UP 
Now were in the projection booth and have three film rolls: grey, black and silver. The silver one is the missing film, but you need to watch it to know. You can take the other ones and watch them too, by PUT (COLOUR) IN PROJECTOR and TURN PROJECTOR ON.
(Ive tried going into the pawn shop in a replay to see if you could sell the film, but no staff are available, so theres no evil option)
Go back to the museum and talk to the curator. You dont even need to officially get the mission first to get the reward.
Kill Hitler. You can even get $75 for it! In an alley near Loome Street amongst the twisty passages, there is a bar to the south that you will find him in. I only needed to attack twice.

JUST FOR FUN
Every place normally has a joke attached to it, or a certain backstory if you cant go into it. Go everywhere as Yars clever enough not to go into dangerous places.
The tea room is Cheers without Alcohol.
Death punches you in an alleyway near Holden. Attack Death once and hes gone. You can still die in this game from other battles though, but Clara will find you even hotter.
Theres Bigby Burrito. Sometimes you will hear customers grumble in the never-moving queue, but you can hear some hints on what else can be done.
The Hacker Hall of Shame is a museum with four exhibits.
The Unitarian Hall plays a film after you go through a procedure.
You can also play the Sega Saturn at Porns place after the same procedure. Still got it!

COWBOY BEBOP
The best freelance paycheque you can get is with four bounties. Dapper is listed, but not an option. Information on bounties is available at the Registrars Office (X WANTED POSTER and T INFOBOT) and they can be collected at the Post Office (T CLERK). The missing poster shows that one Monica Simmons is very similar to our described Post Office Clerk, but this seems to be an aborted arc so you cant talk to her about it or take the posters.

SCOREZ
This available bounty is unpleasant, but you can do so at any time and no risk to yourself.
At any bus station, ENTER BUS.
If you dont remember Scorezs name from the Infobot, or got on the bus right away, Porn will see Scorez and point out how vile he is anyway. He needs to be stopped. Youre unlikely to win a fight against Admiral Scorez, but you can keep the little girl hes trying to groom safe by talking to her.
TALK TO THE LITTLE GIRL. Do this twice. Telling her not to talk to strangers, and reminding her of your local hero status on the news works best, so option 2 is what you go with in both cases.
Now you have the little girls trust and youre her designated acquaintance to help her home. Scorez will angrily get off the bus and stand in front of it. His telephone conversation shows something terrible may happen to the bus, and the drivers furious.
TALK TO THE DRIVER. Do this twice.
Then youll convince him to do the right thing: run over Scorez. Dont worry about the little girl after this as she lives near Konrad Street and will get off shortly. I think there was an option to take her to her doorstep, but it was a deleted arc, sadly.
You dont need to get on the bus again except for convenience. EXIT BUS at any stop you like. Go to the Post Office for your bounty.

MCCORMICK
This ones dangerous, and its easy to make the mistake of wanting him gone now and miss out on a few areas. No difference game-wise and you still get your bounty though. 
Go to the Music Store to see your friend Vaughan. Youll have to ATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL, move east, attack a few times before McCormick gives up and goes south. Vaughan is now safe, but make sure hes okay. Go in, talk with him and get some money on your card and a hint to McCormicks next location. Go to the condemned building on Duffy Street, which is actually a front for cock-fighting. McCormick will go upstairs with some company.
If you have some ree and your health is low, take it. If not, go to the dealer near the pawn shop on Grotto Street.
UP
ATTACK MCCORMICK WITH PISTOL until hes gone. You can take his stuff, but surprisingly there is no need for the defibrillator. 
If you like you can T PROSTITUTE and escort her to a nightclub you conveniently cant enter because you have no ID. Go to the Post Office to get your bounty.

FAILED ROMERO
This one takes place in the robotics shop on Konrad Street. ENTER STORE.
T WOMAN. Her name is Tera if you go for 1 first.
AGAIN until you snap and find out the reason for her curt attitude. Failed Romero, her creation, is returning.
Porn knows what to do. T PORN. You need to buy him some time.
T TERA but this fails to save her.
T ROMERO. Option 2.
T ROMERO. Option 2.
No need to attack, he will be shut down.
EXIT STORE and return to the Post Office to collect your bounty.

LEANDRA
This starts with a few small-cash jobs that will eventually give you the starting clue to collect her bounty. You dont have to do all this in one go.
Lightspeed Couriers
T CLERK. You need to get a handprint of the recipient on the scanner the clerk hands you to get paid and the package opened.
Go to the address in Holden. This is the battered low-income multiple housing complex on the east, between Holden and Loome.
Theres nothing in this dirty living room except a keg which doesnt seem much cleaner, given the way Porn reacts to the beer inside it. Lets go into the kitchen, our tenant may be here.
ENTER and EXIT are your verbs for the kitchen.
ENTER KITCHEN
X BODY
Well, thats not helpful for us. We just needed a handprint.
X LAPTOP (You cant use it, but theres a CD drive)
EXIT KITCHEN
X KEG
OPEN KEG
OPEN KEG
OPEN KEG
X BEER
Now, you probably already know what the pink bits are, but to retrieve it, youll have to LOOK INSIDE KEG and then TAKE HAND. PUT HAND ON SCANNER. Now the package is open. TAKE CD. You can ENTER KITCHEN and PUT CD IN LAPTOP. Theres nowhere to sell the information as I can tell. Now we can return to the couriers and get a small amount of cash for our work. Unfortunately, you cant sell the hand to the morgue after youre done.
Getting Boricks Cheque
Go to the tattoo parlour. Borick will be complaining to Jake about someone who owes him a cheque. So, TALK TO BORICK about it. Hell give you a name and mention the guys a college student, though he wont give you a tattoo.
Look up the name on the Infobot. Do we know any students? Not very well, as hes dead. Since Yar prints out a pre-decomposition photo of him, we have the basis of our identity theft.
Go to the Living Mask store. Remember to take your credit card and have it in your hand when you ask the talented man to help you. Our guy will take a few turns to get the mask done, so you might as well do some of the other jobs and bounties before coming back. 
WEAR MASK
Go to the Post Office. T CLERK to get the cheque.
Being honest with your employer is the best policy, as it was with the film roll. Go back to the Tattoo Parlour. Give the cheque to Borick, and hell give you a pager and tell your trustworthy self about a goal of his: tattooing the hacker Leandra Jones in revenge. If you find her, page him and hell arrive in a few turns- and youll still get your bounty. 
Giving you Leandras full name is a valuable tip, so go to the Infobot for her last-known address.
You can finally enter the townhouse on the very west point of Loome Street. Knock on the door and the sobbing guy will let you open it.
The sobbing guy is Mitchell, Leandras ex-boyfriend.
T MITCHELL. Ask Where is she now? to hasten the process. Clara will slap some sense into him. Leandras moved to Pang Street, east of here. Remember that apartment we cant get into? You can beat up Mitchell afterwards, but theres no point.
If you arent full on health, buying some Ree would be smart before you go any further.
When you get to Pang Street, get your pistol out of your backpack. The door is to the north.
KNOCK ON DOOR
Oh great, another thug answers.
ENTER APARTMENT
UP
UP
You have to get rid of the thug before you can enter Leandras apartment anyway. ATTACK THUG WITH PISTOL and AGAIN until hes gone. If you need to escape to take some Ree, go DOWN.
ENTER APARTMENT
As soon as you can see Leandra, ACTIVATE PAGER.
Whatever you say wont matter, but to keep Leandra in her apartment until Borick arrives, you may have to attack her a few times right after she rummages her drawer and removes another problem.
Borick will show up, knock her out for you if you havent done so already, have his revenge and give you some cash.
EXIT APARTMENT
DOWN 
DOWN
EXIT APARTMENT
Go back to the Post Office to collect your bounty.

Porns Donation Drive
Go to the Medical Centre. The receptionist will take Porn to another room for his regular visit, so you might as well X MAGAZINE while youre waiting and learn about neurosurgery. No more pussy-footing. If you can get your head fixed you can easily make the money you need and experience the joys of electronics. Porn will generously give you the $25 from his monthly donation and then you can TALK TO THE RECEPTIONIST. 1 will tell her all of your troubles and youll get a quote for the surgery to help you if you keep talking to her. If youve followed this walkthrough in the order of writing, this wont be a problem.
Internet Caf
Here you can put your skills to the test. One terminal is free.
USE COMPUTER. You havent lost your touch.
Soon after this, if you go back to this area again after a few turns, Johnny Dapper will appear and either take $2331 if you have it or the CD you copied if you dont. You cant shoot him or talk your way out of it. Porn will then suggest you either sell your CD of code (or intercept Dapper selling it) at the pawn shop. So, if youre ready to end the conflict, head there.
Reading time!
TALK TO NEVE 
A guard will appear who seems like bad news, but is fulfilling a new contract from Porn. You now have a cable.
PLUG CABLE INTO TERMINAL lets you see where Neve is now, and tells you of an upcoming guard. Youll have to wait a few turns but now you know. You can ATTACK GUARD WITH CABLE to knock him out, but ATTACK GUARD is the only thing you need.
Here, ENTER and EXIT are your verbs for all rooms. Outside of the cell, there is a darkened room with an energy pak, west has another storage room with your pistol, and a cafeteria with one guy who recognises you.
TALK TO BILLY. Billys sympathetic and wont hurt you.  Talk to him about everything.
PUT PAK INTO PISTOL. As far as attacking anyone with the pistol goes, remember you need one charge remaining before you go into the front hall.
 Go west to the stairwell. Upstairs first.
Go to the lab at the west end. ATTACK NEVE WITH PISTOL. TAKE ALL. You can use her keypass to enter storage for some ree and horror when you remove the sheet.
Downstairs:
You can go into Neves office by unlocking the door with her keypass, but this is more for poignancy than for helping you escape. At the east end of the hall, use Neves pass to unlock the door to the doctors room.
ATTACK PAD WITH PISTOL to survive. Then ATTACK DOCTOR WITH PISTOL until its over. If you have only one charge left, just ATTACK. TAKE ALL, as you need to unlock the reception door with the pass and free money will help with your trip. The rees nice too.
When you go into reception after unlocking the door, SHOOT CHANDELIER. 
EXIT. 
W. 
UNLOCK GARAGE DOOR WITH PASS.
ENTER GARAGE.
This is it. This part of the garage houses the door to your escape from all of New Haz. 
X LOG BOOK- the doctor drives the Porsche.
Your friends are now here. Porn will be warning you of the guards trying to shoot their way in, so get busy. T CLARA. Both will get the strongbox open, but 1 means shell go with you even though it hurts. It would hurt a lot more not to tell the truth and 1 saves you a turn.
TAKE WIRELESS (the wireless key fob is for the Porsche). 
UNLOCK HIGHWAY DOOR WITH BANK CARD to pay off your fictional, final debt and open the door.
PRESS WIRELESS to open the Porsche doors. Make sure you have taken the wireless as sometimes you can press the button without doing so, and then waste a few turns not realising why you cant drive the car and having to get out to get the keys.
ENTER PORSCHE
DRIVE PORSCHE into your first dawn ever seen, with your girlfriend by your side and your mate cheering you on (who hopefully escapes later).Solution To Farmers Daughter (finally)

                           Wednesday, 14th October, 1998.
                                     Version 1.0

>> else you should wait several turns before dropping the kitten.  This
>> isn't absolutely necessary, but it allows your later trips to be

*** 10 POINTS AND WINNING MOVE OF GAME ***Walkthrough for A Very Hairy Fish-Mess
A Hideous Holiday Horror by Byron Alexander Campbell

This game was my attempt at a more traditional IF, with compass directions and puzzles to solve and plenty of ways to die.  It goes without saying that in this walkthrough I've included only the moves necessary to win, but experimentation should be rewarded, whether it's in the form of a funny response or a grisly death.  Taking and eating things are most likely to yield a unique response.  It's not supposed to be an unforgivingly hard game, but there may be a few rare parts where the puzzles are too opaque or the parser asks for too specific a command; if you run into this, you can curse my programming inexperience to the seventh generation, and hopefully this guide will help move things along.  Oh, and Merry Fishmas!

                            Getfeldt's Treasure

                             by Mike Salisbury

                           Written by Richard Bos


  First, some notes. 
  
  To start with, this is an MS-DOS game written in Quick Basic, and a port of
an original for the even earlier Tandy Color. This shows, sometimes badly.
Technically, the program is rather restrictive. There are no command recall
facilities, not even the ones used by the DOS command line. At least capitals
are accepted, but never significant. The most unpleasant lack, though, is that
you cannot save your game. At least it's not very long.
  As far as vocabulary is concerned, it has what it needs and nothing more.
Only the first three letters of a word are significant, except where they
aren't - see below. Some abbreviations are recognised, and some are required;
specifically, "east" is only recognised as a full word in "go east", not on its
own. You'll have to use "e". This one limitation is not very onerous, of
course. Also, you can't use "it".
  Another limitation is that this program is very bad for guess-the-verb. At
times, it even needs guess-the-exact-command. Synonyms are not common. "Get"
and "Take" will both work, and that's about it except where a special case has
been accounted for. But those pre-defined commands have their foibles, one of
which is is that they do not always recognise abbreviated words. Some work with
a three-letter abbreviation but not with a four-letter one. Some demand the
entire noun but allow the verb to be abbreviated; some do not. Using the entire
words in all commands would be best, which makes it all the more inconsistent
that "east" is not recognised on its own. And, of course, where I've used "the"
below to make the text read better, omit it.
  Those special cases have another problem: they are not accepted except in the
very circumstances for which they have been anticipated. Everywhere else they
will be treated as if you typed nonsense, or give a non-committal message such
as "nothing happens" where "that is not here" would be a more appropriate.
Similarly, "look object" and "read object" are not the same thing even where
they should be - in at least one case, "look object" says "nothing to be read",
but "read object" tells you what is written on it!
  Real bugs are, as far as I have found, rare. That is to say, bugs which
affect gameplay seem rare. You need to be careful not to lose your dog before
you get him - that seems to be all. Cosmetic bugs are much more common. One or
two messages seem incomplete, but the most common bug is that room descriptions
remain static when they shouldn't - objects remain in view when you take them,
that sort of thing. Misspelled words are also common.
  Finally, since this is a walkthrough, spoilers are rife below. I'm not taking
you past every single clue and sight - in fact, I'm not taking you past any.
All code numbers I'll be giving you can be found in the game somewhere. As
mentioned above, the Look and Read commands are not always helpful, but they do
occasionally reveal something useful. Therefore, look at everything before you
resort to this walkthrough, and if you accidentally read the solution to a
problem you hadn't come across yet, don't blame me.

  Now, let's go and get that treasure.  


  You start in Getfeldt's garden. Go east, take the crowbar, and go west and
south. Use the crowbar. (Yes, "use". Tsk, tsk... naughty implementor.) Drop the
crowbar. Open door, go east and north. Move the painting. You're asked for a
combination, which is 121513. Yes, a hint this can be found elsewhere in the
game. No, I'm not telling you where. Serves you right for reading walkthroughs.
Take and wear the amulet.
  Go s, s, e. Open the refrigerator ("fridge" is not recognised) and take the
steak. Go east. Now (and you must enter this as one command, nor will you be
allowed to proceed until you do) "give steak". Get the treats, and give treat.
If you now check your inventory, you'll find that you are carrying the dog!
  Pull the lever and go down. Take the gear and the balloon. Go east twice.
Unlock the door - the code is 6603243e. Go east twice more, then north and up.
Start the engine and set the navigation. You'll be asked for the coordinates,
which are 121.15.09:34.09.12 - and you've already come across these, although
I haven't told you explicitly where to find them. 
  Go east twice. Wear your gear, then go down and north. First turn the wheel,
then the handle. Go east. Close the door, and when asked which, enter /~\I
(slash, tilde, backslash, single I: the "one" version of the visible door's
"two"). Now "push green". Do not "push green pad" - that doesn't work. Turn
the cross.
  Go east, look shelf, take batteries, go east, take flashlight. Go south. Put
batteries in flashlight. Drop the flashlight, batteries (yes, you have to drop
them individually even though you just put them in the flashlight), balloon,
gear and treats. Go west. Put amulet in star, get chest, go east. No, all your
stuff hasn't disappeared. It's still here, it's just not shown in the room
description.
  Take the gear and balloon - leave the rest. Go back n, w, w. Take the net.
Wear the gear. Close the door - enter /~\II, that is, slash, tilde, backslash,
double I - push red and go west. Put chest in net. Attach net. You'll be asked
"to what" - enter "ring", as a single word. Don't ask me why this command could
not be handled in the same way as "put object in object", but if you try that,
you get told to "slow down". Pull the tab.


  Hooray - you have beaten Getfeldt. Although there are messages spread around
the game which make it uncertain how much you've actually "beaten" him and how
much of it was his idea all along. In any case, you're now rich, so no matter
who was the mastermind, it counts as a victory for you!(version 1.0 of this walkthrough -- 11/12/03)

WALKTHROUGH FOR GHOST TRAIN
                -----------

_Ghost Train_, by Paul Johnson, is available at

http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/ghost.z8

(you may need to watch for line breaks in the above URL)

This file is a little discursive, including some actions which are not
necessary to complete the game. However, they should make the experience
more enjoyable. The exact phrases you will need to type into the
interpreter are in ALL CAPS.

This walkthrough is based on
Release 4 / Serial number 070503 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 


ON THE FIRST TRAIN
------------------

Basically your goal is to wait around a few turns. READ NEWSPAPER, TALK
TO INGRID, KISS INGRID, and be sure to X INGRID. She's wearing a
necklace; X NECKLACE. You can take INVENTORY and X TICKET too. Whatever
you do, after a few turns there will be an accident.

AFTER THE ACCIDENT
------------------

Now you're in "blackness. A sleepy unconscious state." You want to WAKE.

Look at the wreckage! No, really, LOOK AT WRECKAGE. You can X BODIES, X
DEBRIS, SEARCH BODIES, and SEARCH DEBRIS too, but it won't get you
anything nifty. Instead go SOUTH. (You could go north, but it would only
take you to an endless set of tracks, so why bother?) X LIGHT and X BOX
here, then go WEST, UP, and WEST again to enter the signal box. You'll
see a ghostly train go by beneath you, but you don't have to worry about
it.

Well, you were looking for a phone, so X PHONE and it tells you how to
use it. TURN HANDLE for some more atmosphere. Next, look at other things
around you. X NECKLACE (look familiar?), X COIN, X LEVER, X PANEL. You
can GET the COIN and NECKLACE. You can PULL and PUSH the LEVER, but I
don't think it does anything useful. Notice that the panel is loosely
attached--PULL PANEL, then LOOK to see what you've uncovered. GET KEY.

That's all here, so EAST, DOWN, and EAST to get back to the tracks. The
strange figure you saw earlier has left a lamp. X LAMP and GET IT. Go on
to the SOUTH. You can X WALLS and X LICHEN for some more atmosphere, and
you can even X WATER and DRINK WATER. Then go SOUTH again.

See the writing on the door? READ WRITING. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY and
go WEST into...

THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY
-----------------------

Go NORTH so you can interact with things.

X CLOCK, X POSTERS, READ SIGN. Notice that the train comes at 10:30 and
the clock thinks it's 10:24 right now. Then go NORTH into the waiting
room.

The ghost will call your name, but you can ignore it for a moment. X
BOOKS, READ BOOKS, READ NEWSPAPER, X SOFA, SIT ON SOFA will all give you
more atmospheric messages. Then you can deal with the ghost. X WINDOW
and wait a turn, then the ghost asks "Fares Please". Then X GHOST. He
wants you to buy a ticket, so GIVE COIN TO GHOST.

Okay, notice the clock is ticking again--at 10:30 the train will be out
at the track. But spare a second to X TICKET to see where you're
going... a cemetery... brrr. Then go SOUTH and wait until the train
arrives. Once it does, go SOUTH again to enter it.

ON THE SECOND TRAIN
-------------------

Pay attention to the colors of the carriages here, and write them down
in order. It will come in handy later.

In room #1 (the westernmost room) is a red door which is locked. In room
#6 is a locked door.

Also in that room is a Ouija board. If you hang around a moment, the
spirits will spell out "HELP US" on the board. X BOARD--you can ask it
about things just as though it were a real person. Sometime about now,
you may get strange messages about mice running through the room, or you
may hear footsteps on the roof of the train. That's okay. It's just
random atmospheric stuff.

Go ahead and ASK BOARD ABOUT whatever you can think of, including: ME,
TRAIN, GHOST, TICKET. But to continue, you must ASK BOARD ABOUT INGRID,
and the door to your east will open. Go EAST and be confronted by a dead
man rotting. Make sure you read his description carefully, especially
the mention of his badge. You can't actually interact with him yet,
though. Notice the key--X BLACK KEY and GET IT. *Now* you've woken up
the dead guy. GIVE TICKET TO GHOST and he'll leave you alone.

Return to room #1 (go WEST six times) and UNLOCK DOOR WITH BLACK KEY.
Then go WEST twice to enter the train's cab. You'll see a bunch of
controls, which you may want to fiddle with yourself before continuing
with this walkthrough.

Your goal is to get the train to stop. The brake wheel looks
promising--TURN BRAKE WHEEL. That slowed it, but didn't stop it. PULL
LEVER to finish the job. Then DOWN to get out of the train.

CEMETERY AND CHAPEL
-------------------

Go NORTH to the cemetery proper. X STONES and it mentions a particular
inscription. READ INSCRIPTION--you don't want it to be true, but it is.
Ingrid's gone. Unless... NORTHWEST takes you to a fairy dance. X
DANCERS, and then go NORTH to the chapel.

X CHAPEL and NORTH takes you inside. X INSCRIPTION. X BIBLE and try to
GET IT. You can X PEWS and X LECTERN too, if you want. Then go EAST to
the bell room. An empty room, except for that rope. You can PULL ROPE to
ring the bell, but it doesn't do much for you. X ROPE hints at the
proper thing to do... You want to CLIMB ROPE.

(I like to PULL ROPE again when I'm at the top of it, right next to the
bell. But then, I read Dorothy Sayers' _Nine Tailors_.)

The language here is a little weird. GET PARCHMENT and then X PARCHMENT.
X BOOKS tells you to search for things by name... You saw the name of
the church is St. Gorgon (although it was spelled differently), so
SEARCH GORGON and GET EXORCISM. READ EXORCISM for some colorful
language, but nothing else of use. CLIMB ROPE to get back down ("down"
doesn't work, for some reason). WEST and SOUTH to leave the chapel.

Now, you want to go around back. So NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST. X GARGOYLE
and READ INSCRIPTION. Aha, a clue. Go back to the dancers by going
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, then SOUTH. Then ASK DANCERS ABOUT GARGOYLE. The
dancer will kiss you, so I like to KISS DANCERS in return. Then go back
to the chapel and do what the dancers said--three times around,
counterclockwise. You'll end up in back of the chapel having a chat with
Satan.

He asks who dares to call him back; TELL SATAN ABOUT ME. You've only got
one thing on your mind, so ASK SATAN ABOUT INGRID. Uh-oh, is there any
way to save her? ASK SATAN ABOUT HELL. (If this is clued, I don't know
where.) Obviously you have to answer "YES". Satan gives you an hour (60
turns) to do what must be done.

You end up at a funeral service, before an open grave. There's no reason
to know this, but you have to ENTER OPEN GRAVE. DOWN takes you to a pair
of eyes, asking about you. TELL EYES ABOUT ME and then go WEST. X HOUND
to get his name. Pluto (and you can try to go down if you want, but
he'll stop you). Go back EAST and ASK EYES ABOUT PLUTO. Now it's safe to
go WEST and DOWN. DOWN again, and EAST to... yet another train.

THE THIRD TRAIN
---------------

X SWITCH to see which way the train is headed now (northeast), then UP
to enter the train.

OPEN BOX to get a message from Ingrid telling you your goal, then go
NORTH to this train's cab.

The controls are mostly the same as the other train, except that you
must turn the switch to face northwest first, using the colored levers.
Here's where the colors of the second train come in handy... Pull the
colored levers in the order that the carriages were colored in that
train (type PULL RED, PULL BLUE, etc.). I don't actually think it
changes with each game--I think it's always RRBBGR (R = red, B = blue, G
= green).

Now you just have to get the train moving. Remember how the other one
was stopped? Well, do those things in reverse. PUSH REGULATOR LEVER and
TURN BRAKE WHEEL.

If you read the plaque, it will give you a hint how you can escape the
demon: TURN DAMPER, twice.

Congratulations, you win!Solution to "Groove Billygoat" by Efrain Finnell

This is the "quick and dirty" walkthrough that skips a lot of detail.
There is some randomness you may need to account for.
It is suggested you use the in-game hints (type HINT) before resorting
to the walkthrough.

First:
GO IN
GO OUT
WAIT (for about 15 turns or fiddle with your inventory)

The Orphans will escape and Betsy will start singing you a song. Wait
till she's done or drop her to end it early.

Soon after that, the Thin Man will appear in the Bad Part of Town. Wait
for him to go in to the Badder Part of Town and follow him (GO IN).

The StepEasy will now be apparent. Say the password SHAMONE and you'll
get inside.

(This is determined by asking one of the orphans about JAMON which is
what you thought the Thin Man said.)

TAKE OFF COAT
GIVE COAT TO GIRL (You'll get a coatcheck marker.)
NORTHWEST
WEST
MOONWALK NORTH
PUT MARKER IN BEAM
TAKE DIFFERENT MARKER
NORTH
EAST
SOUTHEAST
GIVE MARKER TO GIRL (You'll get the Thin Man's left glove.)

To get to the northeast quadrant where the stairs up are, you must
dance. You need to start in the southwest corner of the warehouse by the
jukebox. You have to start at the beginning of the song. You can either
wait for the Thin Man to throw a coin in the jukebox, put the coin you
found in the trash can in the jukebox if you didn't give it to the bum,
or HIT JUKEBOX Fonzie-style to start the music. Each move must be typed
in order before it happens in the description Don't type in moves the
text says you do automatically as it speeds up toward the end.

You must defeat them randomly by using the Thin Man's dragon shouts.

AAOW - will knock the thugs back and has a chance of disarming them, but
will not stop bullets or ninja stars.
HOO - will stop bullets, thrown ninja stars, and lunging thugs who
attack you physically when out of weapons.
EEHEE - will get rid of whatever is hanging in the air. 

Once you stop all four thugs:

Before revealing the complete solution, I thought it may be helpful to
have some tips for those who are stuck and just want a gentle nudge in
the right direction.

The aim of the game is to collect 5 specific items and leave them in the
pub (hence the name, 'Five Artifacts Inn').
The five artifacts are well-known items from 'The Hitch Hikers Guide to
the Galaxy', so you can discount the items you find that are unique to
the game (such as the Alterian coin).
To check if an item is one of the 5 artifacts, drop it in the Inn and
type SCORE.  You get 20 points for each object, so your score level will
tell you whether you have got a correct item.
Some of the artifacts are useless, except for scoring purposes, but
others are needed to solve puzzles in the game.
To get the Vogon ship to fly, read the book of poetry in the Vogon
Navigation room (where the poetry is graffitti'd on the wall).
To get the 'Heart of Gold' to fly, drop the rusty old engine in the
control room and push the lever (As the sign says: Don't pull the
lever).
Get the babel fish before giving the Arkleseizure a drink.
Use the coin to buy the chocolate first - don't use it on the Nutrimat
until you have the chocolate.

[The gun is only used to shoot Vogons.  The Vogons appear when you are
on their battle cruiser or Kakrafoon.  However, they appear randomly -
sometimes two in a row - so you will need to shoot them each time they
appear.  Don't let your input get ahead of the events onscreen, or you
may find yourself blasted into space.  Secondly, the gun can overheat
after a certain number of turns, so it is important to switch it off
when you are not under threat from the Vogons.]

3/ Cosmic Capers

While browsing through the screenshots in James Burrow's excellent
'gamebase 64', I came across an adventure game called 'Cosmic Capers',
which can be found on the 'Blast from the Past' disks (Blast 97, menu
option 9).  As soon as I saw the first line ("Hi there, guys, I'm Bugsy,
your lovable computer companion."), I knew it was the same game -
especially since 'Bob Chappell' and 'Supersoft' appear in reverse video
on the screen.

If you play this game, you will see that it is exactly the same game as
HH-64.  The only differences are that the reference to Douglas Adams and
Pan Books has been removed, and all the objects and places have been
superficially renamed.  However, it is obvious by the names that the
Hitch Hikers Guide version came first:  all the Cosmic Capers names keep
the same kind of format (for want of a better term): the 'bowl of
petunias' becomes a 'vase of pansies', the 'Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of
Traal' becomes the 'Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo', and so on.  And it
is unlikely that Cosmic Capers was first with the idea of bad alien
poetry!

So, if you want to solve 'Cosmic Capers', just follow the walkthrough
and use the appropriate nouns (eg, 'SHOOT VERRUCAN rather than SHOOT
VOGON).

4/ Miscellaneous

I was stuck on this game for a very long time (somewhere between 13 - 14
years, in fact, but this included several years without a C64).  I
finally found the solution on a disk of adventure game solutions created
using the Vizawrite 64 word processor.  I loaded up "The Hitch Hikers"
file to test the disk, expecting it to be the solution for the Infocom
game, and was bowled over when it turned out to be a walkthrough for the
Supersoft title!  Being in an 80 column format (on a 40 column screen),
I had to take two screen dumps and then stick them together in order to
print the solution out.  When I got home, however, I found that the
walkthrough missed a number of steps - a fairly common problem when
people write solutions down as they play the game.  Having used the
solution to get past my sticking point, I managed to finish the game
with a bit of judicious mapping.  I must say that after having waited so
many years, the ending was quite a disappointment!

There is a Spectrum version of this game (HH-64), which states it is (c)
Estuary Software Products.  It does not say who the programmer was, or
what year it was made.  There is also no reference to whether ESP and
Supersoft are the same software house, or one version was licensed from
the other.  I have always wondered whether HH-64 was  truly a piece of
commercial software, or if the 'by kind permission' line was just a bit
of fun added to a 'tribute' game by some keen fan.  However, it is
strange to find a non-commercial game popping up on two separate
platforms (unless one was just a home-attempt on one platform at
reproducing the commercial version from another platform?).

A post was made on internet news in Nov-Dec 98 by a person who claimed
to have programmed an intro to the game.  They were looking for a copy
of the file as they couldn't find it anywhere on the internet.  Having
searched both comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm, I have not been able
to find a copy of this post either to reproduce it here or obtain the
posters e-mail address in order to get more information from them.
Possibly the question was posted on rec.arts.int-fiction.

Obviously HH-64 had to have been released before Infocom got the rights
to create a HHG game.  According to the 'Infocom Fact Sheet VIII:
Chronology' by Paul David Doherty, the Infocom HHG was released in
October 1984.  I have a note that I bought my copy of this game in
August 1985 (compiled 21st December 1984, if you're interested).  My
preliminary map for HH-64 appears before this entry in my map book, and
it is dated '1st May'.  Whether that is 1984 or 1985 I cannot tell.

No information on HH-64 can be found on the Adventure Games List
maintained by Hans Persson and kept on ftp.gmd.de at
if-archive/info/adventure-game-history.

 
/Andrew.General tips:

Best weapons:
cleaver (village, in store) strength 10
battleaxe (eastern forest, grass roof hut) strength 18
fire whip (mystic cave, held by golem) strength 22

Most wearables has no effect, but the armor and shield (village, paladin)
occasionally heal you, and the cloak (elf) occasionally increases your damage.

There are two NPCs who can help you in combat
Werewolf (in mansion)
Tursk (in caverns)

Eating the rations (village, tavern) will give you an extra 200 hp and refill
your food count.  Eating the food (village, small room) will give you
100 hp and refill your food count, and will reappear in the small room
afterwards.

Most of these solutions were written down from 1986-1990, and all
of them were thorougly commented in Danish. I believe that
comments in a solution is everything, since you will often need to
know what will trigger this or that action. If you don't have a
certain object, you may be stuck, and without any explanations in
the solution, what are you supposed to do?

An Interactive Fiction by Paul Equinox Collins

Note: A few puzzles require speaking with someone who will probably be moving
around. So if you need to "talk to" someone mobile, you may have to walk
around for a bit to find them, or if you're trying to do something sneaky you
may have to wait for them to leave the room before doing it. In these
situations, the next line will be a room to go to to reorient yourself on the
walkthrough.

There's a list of all the students you need to recruit at line 225.
