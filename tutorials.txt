"How to construct a crude pulley system in public under life and death
circumstances, while a mischievous ape tries repeatedly to pull your
shorts down"

This document contains complete spoilers for the game "Three Monkeys One
Cage" by Robert Goodwin. It is inadvisable to be reading this if you
haven't looked at the general in-game hints (type "HINT" during the
game), and even then this document should be used sparingly. The game is
hard, but try to solve as much of it by yourself as you can, yeah?
You'll feel better about yourself.

This solution is explained by sections.

THE MANDRILL -- Keeping him out of your hair

Generally whenever the mandrill enters your corner of the cage or you
enter his, you have one turn to act before he does you in. Early on you
can avoid death by simply moving to a differenct corner of the cage
whenever he approaches. After no sooner than 50 turns into the game the
mandrill will become more aggressive, chasing you almost every turn.
Temporary methods of fending him off, such as throwing dirt at him or
hiding under the bed, may give you a quick breather, but you need a
long-term solution. There are two...


THE HORNETS -- Dangerous when aggravated

The hornets will mind their own business just as long as you don't go
casting a stone at their nest, at which point they will fly all about,
attacking both monkeys and you. From this time on both the chimpanzee
and mandrill will do nothing but run around wildly. This is good in the
sense that the mandrill no longer poses a threat to you, but bad in the
sense that the chimpanzee can no longer help you. Therefore you must
wait until you no longer need the chimpanzee before taking this course
of action, because there is no way to recall the hornets. (If the game
becomes unwinnable when you throw the rock at the nest then you still
needed the chimpanzee to do something)

How do you survive the hornets yourself? Hiding under the bed is only a
temporary solution. To protect yourself for good you'll need to cover
yourself with a sheet or a blanket.


THE FIRE -- Ins and outs of taming flame

Neither the mandrill nor chimpanzee will enter any corner of the cage
where fire or smoke is if they can help it. In order to build a fire you
will need flint, steel, and tinder. The stone serves as flint. The
barbecue fork, the bucket, or the fan serves as steel. The sheet,
blanket, or jersey can be used as tinder. Obviously, to keep the fire
going you'll have to keep feeding it with flammable objects.

If you choose to build the fire in the southwest corner of the cage, you
have the advantage of being able to use the fan to blow smoke (when the
fire is large enough to produce sufficient smoke) to one of the other
three corners. By rotating the fan you can steer the mandrill out of any
corner of your choosing. In addition, the fire will last longer when the
fan is on.

The risk you take when you build the fire in the southwest corner is
that it might catch to your bed. If this happens you must act quickly.
Put out the fire by throwing or kicking dirt onto it.


THE BUCKET -- Don't kick it yourself, let somebody do it for you

How do you get the bucket off the platform? There is no way to get atop
the platform yourself. Only the chimpanzee can, but he needs an
incentive to go there. Hmm, I wonder what that might be. Yes, toss the
banana onto the platform. The chimpanzee will soon jump after it,
knocking the bucket off inadvertently. The bucket will land in the
southwest corner.


BUILDING THE PULLEY -- It's the only way to open the gate

The solution to Three Monkeys One Cage in a nutshell is to set up a
pulley system in which the cord is slung over the bar that protrudes
from the wall, with a bucket attached to the end of the cord. The other
end of the cord is already attached to the top of the gate permanently.
When a weight falls into the bucket, the bucket descends, causing the
gate to rise.

The cord can be tied to various objects, then thrown over the bar. It is
not enough simply to tie the cord to the bucket, for you'll find out
that the cord is short by just a tiny margin when the weight falls and
misses it. You must first tie the cord to a hook, then once the cord is
dangling from the bar you must get the bucket hanging from the hook
somehow. A hook can be found underneath your bed.

The only way to get the bucket onto the hook once it has been slung over
the bar is to lift it using the barbecue fork.


ACTIVATING THE PULLEY -- Getting the weight to drop

Once your pulley is all set up you are ready to drop the weight in the
bucket. If you haven't guessed already, it is a coconut that must be
used for the weight. Have the chimpanzee get one for you. (CHIMP, CLIMB
TREE followed by CHIMP, GET COCONUT)

The coconut must roll down the trough, which you cannot reach yourself.
You need the chimpanzee again for this. (CHIMP, PUT COCONUT ON TROUGH)
If the coconut isn't staying on the trough properly, that is because you
did not remove the husk. You can crack it open with the stone or with
the barbecue fork.

Just because the coconut is on the trough does not mean that it will
roll automatically. The trough must be inclined. You can use the
barbecue fork to raise one end of it. At last, the coconut will fall
into the bucket and the gate will open! (If the coconut isn't landing
squarely in the bucket, read the previous section carefully)


GETTING OUT ALIVE -- How to leap a great distance and live to tell

After you've gotten the gate open there is still more puzzle left to be
solved. The distance to the ground below is too great to jump, yet jump
you must. But you'll need to make some preparations. To begin with, you
must use the cord again in a different way. You need to hold onto it, or
tie it around your waist when you leap outside. The dilemma is in the
fact that the cord can only be used for one purpose at a time; it can't
be tied around your waist while it is being used for the pulley. Were
you to remove the bucket from the hook with the barbecue fork, then pull
away the cord, the gate would go back down. Thus you must keep the gate
open another way while you remove the cord from the bar. Do this by
placing an object in the opening to hold the gate up. Namely, the
barbecue fork.


DISMANTLING THE PULLEY -- But only once you no longer need it

The gate's open and you need that cord again. But the barbecue fork
which could otherwise be used to remove the bucket from the hook is no
longer available. How do you retrieve the cord? This is perhaps the most
difficult part of the puzzle, and it requires some timing. The fact is
that you DO need the fork for this. Before placing it in the gate you
must use that versatile tool in one more capacity--as a torch. The
barbecue fork can be used to lift burning objects out of the fire, such
as the jersey, or the banana peel, or the coconut husk. You can then
"light the fuse" by touching the torch to the cord. Then, before the
cord snaps, extinguish the burning object and wedge that fork in the
gate, as explained above.


THE FINAL STEP -- Before you can fly the cage

Using the procedure described in the previous two sections, you can
almost survive that drop. One more precaution need be taken in order for
you to fall the remainder of the distance without injury. You must
cushion your fall. Throw as many object out the cage as you like, but
the only one that will make any difference is the mattress. Be aware
that you can't pick up the mattress while you're carrying other things.


THE ANVILS -- Death from above

After precisely 100 turns into the game, panels on the ceiling will open
up to release heavy anvils. A falling anvil will most certainly crush
you in five turns unless you take cover by hiding under your bed.
Whereupon the anvils will cease, and bombs will begin dropping in their
stead. When the bombs start dropping you have only nine turns left to
complete the game, so act quickly! There is no way to outlive the bombs
save by completing the puzzle and escaping from the cage.

Questions and Answers
=====================

A. General Questions
--------------------

Can I restore my saved games without having to wait?

 - With the MS-DOS version, you can change your computer's time to
   be more than 30 minutes past the save time. Or you can change the time
   in the save file to be earlier. Changing the byte at position 0C (hex) 
   to a value of 0 always seems to work.


I'm dying of thirst? What do I do?

 - Drink some water.

 - There are various places in the game (including the building) that
   make good water sources. You can also carry one drink's worth in the
   bottle.

 - And the flask also takes a small amount of water.


I'm running out of light! What can I do?

 - You could make sure you finish the game before your lantern dies.

 - You could buy some batteries in the 'all different' maze.

 - You could use the appropriate magic words. They will give your lamp
   a one-time boost good for several hundred moves.

 - Harnessing electricity is a kind of sorcery.

 - There are a couple of words you may have seen that suggest a famous
   person often associated with electricity.

 - They're found in the Sorcerer's Lair. Type them as separate commands.

 - Don't do it until your lamp is out of power.

 - Drop your lamp first. 


What do I do about these little dwarves?

 - If you could just get them on your side, you could have one heck
   of a party.

 - But they're set in their ways. 

 - The first dwarf that attacks you drops an axe. Get it, then throw it
   whenever there are dwarves attacking you.

 - Throwing the sword works too, as does just waving it about.

 - Eventually, you'll also learn a magic word that you can use to defeat
   them.


A pirate stole my treasure. How can I get it back?

 - Actually, you need this to happen, or you won't be able to get his
   treasure chest.
 
 - After he steals from you, go find his chest in the 'all alike' maze.
   He won't steal from you after you get it.


What should I do with the dwarf's horn?

 - A bunch of dwarves attack you when you blow it.

 - The right magic word might get rid of them.

 - It's handy for getting back any treasure stolen by the dwarves.

 - It's easier if you wear some protection.

 - And a magic way to get rid of the dwarves helps too, just be
   careful you follow the instructions.

 - Then again, you could call the owl instead.


B. Above Ground
---------------

What am I doing here?
 
 - As an adventurer of some ambition, you are trying to collect a bunch 
   of treasures in the small brick building without getting killed.

 - If you do, you might get a nice reward.

 - You may be looking for something in which to carry water.

 - Follow the path that leads away from the house.

 _ I said "the path", not "the road"!


How do I get into the cave?
	
 - There are two ways.

 - The obvious way is to unlock the grate with the keys from the building.

 - You will also learn a couple of magic words that will let you teleport
   in and out from the building.


How do I get past the wizard's gate?

 - The gate is hinged on both sides.

 - First, you have to undo the hinges with some sort of screwdriver.

 - A certain treasure would make a good screwdriver.

 - I'm lying -- there's no way past.


What's the meaning of the wooden notice?

 - I would read it as 'To those who come after me: this is the place to
   ---- the s--'.

 - It's not important until much later in the game. I'd better not reveal
   the answer just yet.


C. Hall of Mists and Vicinity
-----------------------------

How do I get past the snake?

 - You can't subdue it yourself.

 - You need the help of another being.

 - Catch the bird in the cage, then 'drop bird' or 'free bird' in the 
   Hall of Mt King.


How can I keep the bird from being frightened?

 - Read carefully what the game tells you when you first ask for help.

 - The bird is afraid of something about you.

 - Did you read the instructions offered to you when you entered the game?
   It is written: "Some objects have side-effects; for instance, rods
   scare birds."

 - It's afraid of your black rod. Drop it before trying to catch the bird.


How do I get past the dragon?

 - Just attack it.

 - Yes, with your bare hands.

 - Don't you wish all the monsters were this wimpy?


How do I get the Persian rug?

 - Roll it up first.


How do I get the gold nugget out of the cave?

 - You could try throwing it to that passage above the dome.

 - But the result is not very convenient.

 - Rather than carrying it up the steps, use a magic-word exit.


What does the hollow voice mean?

 - It's saying a magic word.

 - The word will teleport you between the Y2 room and the building.
   This is usually the quickest way to get from the cave to the building
   and back.


How do I get across the fissure?

 - Wave the rod. (Nothing really suggests this specifically, but it
   stands to reason that magic wands are made for waving.)


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all different?

 - The names of the locations are subtly different.

 - By making a grid and noting where each direction leads from
   each location, you can build a map. It's a hassle, though.

 - Actually, you don't need to go into this maze to finish the game with
   all the points.

 - I haven't mapped it all out myself. From the west end of long hall,
   you can go 'south, up, up, south' to get to the vending machine.

 - 'north, down, down, down' should get you back out.


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all alike?

 - This is probably the most famous maze in all of computer gaming. You
   should feel honored just to be lost in it. 

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.
   Then you can make a grid and chart out which directions go from where
   to where.

 - Or you can ask the game to cheat and show you the list of exits from
   every location, which makes them very much less alike.

 - The main thing is to get the pirate's treasure chest and any treasures
   he's stolen from you.

 - From the west end of the Hall of Mists, you can go south, east, south,
   south, south, north, east, east, northwest to get to the chest. Then go
   southeast, north, down to get out of the maze.


What does the message in the sandstone chamber mean?

 - It's a favourite quote from technical manuals.

 - It's in Dwarvish. Surely you can read Dwarvish!

 - Translate it by moving each letter back one in the alphabet.

 - This method works for translating the dwarves' speech, too.


How do I get the flute from the shadowy figure?

 - Is the figure trying to attract your attention?

 - Have you seen it in more than one place?

 - It seems familiar.

 - It looks a lot like you.

 - It is you. Go to the mirror canyon for an explanation.

 - There is no flute, of course. I made that up.

 - But you could try 'reflect' and see what happens.

 - Reflecting gets you to the other side of the mirror, though it is
   not at all obvious.


D. Anteroom and Vicinity
------------------------

What are the magazines for?

 - They are traditionally associated with a last lousy point.
  
 - Leaving them at Witt's End gives you that point. 

 - Why at Witt's End? I haven't the faintest idea.


How do I get out of Witt's End?

 - If you go west sixty-five times, you'll get to the anteroom. It 
   always feels longer on the way back.

 - Wait -- maybe it's 165 times.

 - Actually, just wander around, going any direction except west.
   After a few moves, you should get out.


How do I get the tusk out of the very low room?

 - There's no way to get it through the slit.

 - The only way out is down into the sewer, although you seem to die
   when you go there.

 - Perhaps you should wait till the sewage level drops.

 - Actually, if you go back up from the shaft and then down again, you'll
   be able to get into the sewers.

 - You'll find anything you lost down the shaft (or in the cellar), plus a
   spoon.

 - Make sure to find your way out before you drown, and before
   the rats get you.


How do I navigate the maze of passages with streams?

 - I must say, I roll my eyes at the solution to this one.

 - The game's hint suggests that you're somehow offending the dwarves,
   I guess.

 - You've just left the sewers. Maybe it's that nasty smell.

 - 'wash', then wander up until you get out.


How do I turn the spoon into a treasure?

 - 'epns' seems like it ought to be a magic word.

 - But it's not. 

 - Did you try polishing it?

 - I guess the spoon is just worthless.


What is the rope in the chapel for?

 - Climb it.


How can I get out of the giant's dungeon?

 - 'lift flagstone', then go south, then climb up.

 - Of course, you probably lost some stuff when you got thrown in, and
   the trick is getting it back.


What do I do in the giant's living quarters?

 - You could bring the food with you. Then he'll eat it and kick you
   back out. But that doesn't get you anywhere.

 - What else might the giant enjoy?

 - Bring the nest with you. While he's eating the eggs, you can do what you
   like. Of course, the nest is a treasure, so you'll need to get it back
   somehow. See the troll question for more help.

 - The room description doesn't actually say so, but you can go south, too.


How do I get past the spider?

 - Kill it with the sword.

 - But surely you don't have the sword yet.

 - You'll have to engage the help of a nearby friend.

 - The owl will eat the spider for you. Summon him with 'hoot'.

 - Your light scares him away. Turn it off first.

 - To get the documents, just cut the web with your axe.


How do I get the mask in the thieves den?

 - The game says you can't. And it tells the truth.


How do I get the orb from the cellar?

 - If you could only get past the portcullis.

 - Or the slab.

 - Or the drain. Which is it?

 - It's none of these. The actual solution seems obscure, frankly.

 - Get the orb, then drop something else. If it goes down the drain,
   get it later in the sewer.

 - If you drop anything large, e.g. the sword, the wizard kicks it out
   with you. 

 - Of course, you may be able to get the orb without going into the
   cellar.

 - A portcullis is not the same thing as a solid door, and the drain
   has its uses.

 - No, you'll have to work out the rest for yourself. Or go into
   the cellar, like everybody else does.



What do the images in the orb mean?

 - They're visions of things that will happen as you play the game.

 - They can be used as a guide in a particular chain of problems.

 - You'll have to work out for yourself how to know whether the
   vision you see indicates your next task, or some random future
   one.

 - You don't need to use the visions, so you don't need to be told
   how to do that.


What is the crypt for?

 - That's where the vampire shows up. I hope you found the crucifix and the
   holy water.

 - To summon the vampire, you need the wizard's help.

 - There are several ways to invoke the wizard's help. One of them involves
   the little bird. Read the description carefully.

 - Sorry, I'm lying again. The vampire doesn't move into the crypt until
   Adventure 770. In this game the crypt is just scenery.


How do I get into the storage room in the tower?

 - No way to do that in this version.



How do I get past the dwarves at the top of the stairs?

 - You could attack them from above.

 - First you'd need to get on top of the tower from the outside.

 - But you can't. There is no way to get past them. At least not in
   this version of the game.


What is special about the chalice?

 - If you fill the chalice and then drink, some strange things happen.
  
 - But whatever you do, you end up losing the chalice, which is a treasure.

 - It's fun to try, but I don't think you can help the princess 
   successfully. Just treat the chalice like any other treasure.


E. Bedquilt and Vicinity
------------------------

Can I get around the Bedquilt area more easily?

 - In some places, you can type the name of an adjacent room
   to get to it. That can help avoid the problem of crawling around and
   winding up back where you started from.


How do I keep the vase from shattering?

 - You need to cushion its fall.

 - Before you drop it, drop the pillow from the soft room.


How do I get a light source into the room past the emerald?

 - If you could carry a light source into the plover room, that would do
   it. But nothing will fit in from the west. 

 - Are there any other ways to get to the plover room?

 - Yes, actually. Pay attention to the bad pun in the plover room hint.

 - "Why to plover" means "Y2, plover". Typing 'plover' in the Y2 room
   will get you there. 'Plover' will get you back too, but you can't get
   the emerald out that way. This is not something you could figure out,
   but you can stumble across the solution by trying to refer to the 
   plover-egg-sized emerald as "plover".

 - There is actually a way to get a light source into the plover room
   from the alcove, as the hint suggests.

 - It's something that can be in two places at once.

 - But you need to ignite it first.



What do I do with the clam?

 - You can pick it up.

 - You can open it.

 - What would be a good tool for clam prying? Think of sea-related things.

 - 'open clam' while you're carrying the trident.

 - A pearl rolled out. Go down to the cul-de-sac and get it.


How do I get past the quicksand?

 - Create a bridge.

 - Read the game's responses carefully.

 - When you wave the rod here, although nothing obvious happens, you
   temporarily solidify the quicksand. You have to wave the rod again
   to get back.


How do I cross the reservoir?

 - A full-sized yacht would help.

 - Could you magick the "Ruby Yacht" (my, what an awful pun!) to grow
   in size? Or maybe shrink yourself enough to use the yacht?

 - No dice. You can't get across it from the south.

 - Read the game's hint.

 - You can get to the north side by going down the whirlpool in the 
   waterfall cavern. Make sure not to take anything but your lamp.

 - Hit the gong to summon Darwin, whom you can ride south.


How do I get the sword in the stone?

 - Like the game's hint says, you're just not strong enough.

 - Someone with bulging muscles could probably pull it out.

 - Eat the mushroom from the dank cave.


How can I keep from losing objects in the valuation room?

 - Don't drop them there.


F. The Plant and Beyond
-----------------------

What do I do with the little plant?

 - It seems to want water.

 - Bring water in your bottle, then 'water plant'.

 - Do it once more for good measure. Now you can climb up to the hole.

 - Maybe you should try watering it a third time?


How do I get past the rusted door?

 - It just needs a little oil.

 - Fill your bottle with oil from the east pit in the Twopit room,
   then 'oil door'.


How do I get past the ogre?

 - The game's hint warns against hand-to-hand combat. 

 - Throw something.

 - The axe isn't good enough.

 - Throw the sword. Its name is 'Thrower', after all.


Is there anything to do in the Sorcerer's Lair?

 - Remember the magic words on the wall.

 - You might have seen or will see something that emits blue light.
   Maybe it is at home here?

 - Try dropping the starstone here.

 - Yes, the effect can be handy in some special circumstances, but you 
   don't really need to do this.


How do I get past the sheets of slime?

 - Fight the green slime with something green.

 - Throw the vial from the spherical room.


How do I get out of the maze of ice tunnels?

 - Map the maze. The passages are all either straight, or bend only
   a little.

 - Don't miss the sculpture.

 - Look at your map upside down. It spells a five-letter word.

 - Go to the 'This way out' room and use that word.


G. The Troll and Beyond
-----------------------

How do I get past the troll?

 - Throw him a treasure.

 - You'll need one you can reclaim.

 - Throw him the nest.

 - Remember the words in the Giant room?

 - Type them, one after another. You should get the response 'Done!' at the
   end.

 - The eggs then return to the Giant room.

 - Make sure you don't reclaim them until you've finished with the area
   past the bridge. Otherwise the troll will take revenge on you.


How do I get back across the wooden bridge?

 - You need help. Something scary.

 - The bear can help.

 - Free him, then 'get bear'.

 - Use the keys to unlock the chain.

 - Feed the bear first.

 - Try to cross the bridge, then 'free bear'.


Is there anything to do in the volcano room?

 - Not in the original 350-point version of Adventure.

 - Here, yes.

 - Make a bridge. You know the routine.

 - You need something to protect you from the fumes. How about a
   mithril ring?

 - You can turn the sword into a ring. Use a magic word.

 - It's the word written on the stone you found the sword in.


What do I do at the minotaur statue?

 - There's a hint at a dead end elsewhere in the cave.

 - You need to use the proper tool.

 - The proper tool can be found in the tool room.

 - Not the rags. The proper tool is a magic word.


How do I get away from the gooseberry goblins?

 - Are you familiar with the myth of Cadmus?

 - I think he sowed something and grew an army of soldiers, although his
   soldiers ended up fighting each other.

 - He sowed dragon's teeth, as I recall. You can just throw them.


How do I get through the fog?

 - The game's hint suggests a question that is answered differently in
   different places.

 - 'Do I need to have my lamp on?' is a good question.

 - The answer to the question is 'Not here'.


What is the pentagram for?

 - Use it to imprison summoned beings.

 - You can imprison the London Dry Djinn in it.

 - Drop the flask here, then open it, then free the Djinn.


How can I get the starstone after I drop it?

 - It has strange spatial properties.

 - It's sort of in two places at once. One location (the one not where you
   drop it) is where it's real.

 - So when you drop it in the building, it's not really there. Note that
   you don't get points when you drop it there.

 - You need to drop it somewhere else outside.

 - Remember the wooden notice? The last word was 'starstone'.

 - Luckily, the Djinn will take care of the giant for you.


How can I get back past the basilisk?

 - Use the old mirror trick.

 - That metal plate ought to do fine.

 - But it needs polishing.

 - 'rub plate' while you're carrying the rags. Then carry the
   mirror past the basilisk.


How do I get out of the catacombs?

 - They're hard to map, since they change from game to game.

 - It works like this. The first time you go through the catacombs, any
   sequence of eighteen moves will get you back to 'Y2?'. That sequence
   determines the layout of the catacombs. When you reenter, you have to
   move the same way, or you end up kind of going backward. If you like,
   you can play around with dropping objects and see what I mean. I usually
   just go straight west the first time. Then I reenter, go west eleven or 
   twelve times, then wander around a little until I get to the portal.

 - After I leave the area past the portal, I just go straight west until
   I'm back at 'Y2?'.


How do I get the skeleton's sceptre past the bridge?

 - You need to leave it behind and get it later.

 - Leave it in the safe. You can also enter the safe from the room with 
   vaulted ceiling.

 - How do you open the safe? The game's hint suggests a skeleton key.

 - Use the magic word the skeleton gave you.

 - The word changes from game to game.  Make sure you use the right one.
   (There are four of them, and you'll need to know all four to finish
   the game.)


How do I learn all skeleton magic words?

 - You don't need them yet.

 - But you will.

 - Try wearing the crown.

 - Can't hear anything intelligible? Maybe you should try listening.

 - Just make sure you don't wind up dead.


What is the Djinn's word for?

 - It defeats dwarves. Of course, it also sometimes destroys your
   weapons and even gets you killed. Make sure you follow the Djinn's
   advice.


H. The End Game
---------------

The cave is closing! What should I do?

 - You should feel happy, since it means you've found all the treasures and
   are preparing to head to the end game.

 - Just wander around until the cave closes.


The cave has closed. What's going on here?

 - You need to get out of the repository.

 - Breaking the mirror doesn't work.

 - There's one kind of object here you haven't seen before.

 - The rods with red marks (not stars) are actually dynamite.

 - Blow up the northeast area.

 - Drop one of the red-mark rods in the northeast area, then go southwest,
   then 'blast'.

 - If you could get one of those lamps lit, you could go through the hole.

 - There's no way to light them.

 - Just ride the unicorn. 


I'm surrounded by gray mist. What do I do?

 - That's it! You've won!

 - Not really. You need to magic-word your way out of here.

 - There are sixteen magic words in the game. Note that 'plover' is a
   'travel option' -- it is not considered a magic word.

 - Just say them in the right order. The game will respond 'Ok.' after
   each one.

 - Remember the Djinn's story about Ralph Witt?

 - Ralph Witt liked the idea of reverse alphabetical order.

 - Say the words in reverse alphabetical order.

 - Still no luck? That's because the magic word given to you by the
   skeleton changes from game to game, and you need to know all its
   possible versions.

 - Perhaps you should have worn the crown, which you found in the safe.


I'm back at end of road again. What do I do?

 - First, you'll notice that the locations are connected backward.

 - There are other small changes.

 - The notice at the view has changed.

 - But it doesn't say anything useful.

 - The five-inch slit is now a five-foot slit.

 - Go ahead. Go on in.


I. Super Spoilers
-----------------

What are all the magic words?

 - I just can't bring myself to reveal them here. I think the hints in
   this file tell you all you need to find them, though. Remember, there
   are sixteen individual words, and 'plover' is not one of them.


What are all the treasures?

 - There are thirty-two treasures in all:

   bag of pieces of eight (beach)
   crown (safe)
   nugget (nugget of gold room)
   diamonds (west side of fissure)
   silver (N/S passage)
   jewelry (south side chamber)
   coins (west side chamber)
   treasure chest (dead end in maze of passages, all alike)
   nest of golden eggs (Giant room)
   trident (cavern with waterfall)
   helmet (Morion room)
   vase (Oriental room)
   emerald (plover room)
   sceptre (east end of Audience Hall)
   yacht (southern edge of reservoir)
   pyramid (Dark room)
   pearl (cul-de-sac)
   rug (secret canyon)
   spices (chamber of boulders)
   beads (balcony above treasure chamber)
   chain (barren room)
   spyglass (south end of Jonah room)
   sculpture (ice tunnels)
   bracelet (room with translucent walls)
   casket of opals (very small chamber)
   orb (cellar)
   tusk (bones room)
   chalice (recess in the beams)
   sapphire (living quarters)
   crucifix (thieves den)
   starstone (narrow basalt shelf)
   ring (created by player)
 

How do I get all the points?

 - Points are gained as follows:

    20 for getting into a dark area of the cave for the first time
    10 for getting to beach
    10 for getting to Sorcerer's Lair
    10 for getting to Valley of the Stone Faces
     8 for freeing Djinn
    15 for getting to Audience Hall
     7 for discovering each treasure (224 total -- Note that the tusk is
       not considered discovered until you drop it in the building.)
     8 for leaving each treasure in the building (256 total)
    16 shortly before 'cave closing' notice
    16 for getting 'cave closing' notice
    19 for getting to repository
    16 for getting to gray mist
    23 for getting to end of road in the end game
    16 for winning

   659 total? Oh, yes, the last lousy point...

     1 for getting magazines at Witt's End

   660 total. 

 - Points can be lost as follows:

    10 lost for reincarnation
    20 lost for taking a hint

             $adventure walkthrough
          rev. by Jessica Allan 08/02/97

This will RUIN the game for you.  Do not use it unless you
are truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your
life.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this
will ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even 
contains some of the ending.

This is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer's walkthrough, with 
better documentation and some improvements made.  

These commands will not work in every single game.  There 
are some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work
for the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 
point, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows
version does not conform to this, although the documentation
*may* be helpful.  

I highly recommend Rick Adams' page:
http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/
This contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an
FTP site providing source code and compiled versions for 
DOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.
Even with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due 
to some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to
compensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.

For those reasons, you cannot feed this through input 
redirection, although, if you're astute enough, you could 
probably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But
I doubt anyone would bother.

I can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure
on the Web at Stanford's machine:
http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html
That is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the
original format that was used, such as five letter packing
and such that was output from the other machine.  How close
this is to the original version, I can't say.
I recommend the Web version if you're running a 14.4 
connection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit
outdated anyway.

Enjoy playing, and I'm sorry I had to do this to you.  But
if it wasn't for this walkthrough, I never would have gotten
on with *my* life.  :)

Tinseltown Blues walkthrough - by Eytan Zweig
---------------------------------------------

Note - this is a no-frills walkthrough of "Tinseltown Blues". It was written
for version 1.1. 

This walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is 
not an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores 
several non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions
to some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.

On the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant 
chunks, so it's more-or-less clear why you're doing what you're doing. This 
means that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it 
should be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game 
without necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section
I say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from 
beginning to end will know where to begin from.

Note that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, 
but others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will 
say so. 

A final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper 
building) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that 
period, you won't be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker's desk, 
which is randomly determined each game.

Solution to "Bullhockey!" by B F Lindsay

THE APARTMENT

You begin "Bullhockey!" in the upstairs bedroom of your apartment.  Of course you should read the crumpled note, which basically spells out your predicament--your girlfriend Natalie has apparently left, and you are without your work shirts, which you will need to return to work the following Monday (currently it's Wednesday), if only to re-establish some sanity or order in your life.  You won't immediately be able to get down the stairs, because Natalie seems to have returned, to look for her 'mojo' (her 'lucky charm'), and moved some bookcases to block the bottom of the stairway (it's a narrow staircase)--you'll learn this from the sticky note she left on one of the bookcases.  You won't be able to move them from where you are--you'll have to get down by some other means.  All you will need from the upper level here is your backpack, your notepad (SEARCH PILE--the one by the bed), and your walking stick (the staff--LOOK UNDER BED).  Make sure you always have these things, though there will be a few times where you'll  have to put them down.

This is a small, two-story apartment--the overhead fan is just over the banister from all locations on this upper level--but at different distances from each location.  It is also your ticket downstairs, but first, you'll have to turn it off.  The switch is on the fan itself, but you cannot reach it with your hands--you'll need the staff to turn it off with.  If you look at the fan from different locations, you'll see (or not) the switch from different angles.  The switch is on the side opposite from the Loft Bedroom--it is in full view from Stairs--but way too distant.  However, in Bedroom Entrance, it is much closer and you see it in profile--an ideal angle from which to HIT FAN SWITCH WITH STAFF.  Now you want to GET ON FAN, but not from Bedroom Entrance, because you also want something sturdy which will break your fall, when the fan detaches, and possibly reduce chance of injury--how about the train-safe refridgerator??  Go to Loft Bedroom and GET ON FAN (JUMP OVER BANISTER will also work, there).   You will now be able to MOVE BOOKCASES from downstairs--if you want.

You can now explore the apartment, if only to find some clue of where to start your mission.  Read the message on the mirror in the bathroom, take the binoculars, in the black case (these will be indispensible) from Natalie's bedroom. You'll find the key to her closet stuck in her chair cushions if you SIT IN NATALIE'S CHAIR or SEARCH NATALIE'S CHAIR.  You can look in her closet (SEARCH ART DESK to find the light switch for it), but that won't be useful until you find all the shirts.  When you leave Natalie's room, after getting the binocs--Surprise!--you find your office shoes!  Easy points!  Go to the Kitchen and look out the back window--see the odd flash of red?  LOOK AT ODD FLASH WITH BINOCULARS.  Now you have a sense of purpose.  You can go out the front door now, but be sure you're clear on which building the Red Shirt is on top of.  The building right in front of your back window, the one with the black trampoline on top, is Brockwood's Men's Store.  The building that has your shirt on top is the one directly across the street from it going due east--from Brockwood's and your back window (on the east wall of the apartment).  You just need to remember that it's across from Brockwood's.

THE RED SHIRT

- WALTER

Going north out the front gate from the parking lot, you go east to Center Street, then go south to get to Brockwood's.  You are free to do some exploring, but your destination is really the building across the street from Brockwood's.  It's the Vacant Building.  You can't climb up the building from the street; you'll have to go into the building--the main entrance is barred off--but there is another entrance--go south then east into the Gravel Lot--the entrance is north from here.  You'll have to find out how to get Walter to let you in.  Ask him some questions--ASK WALTER ABOUT MAGAZINE, ASK WALTER ABOUT HIMSELF, ASK WALTER ABOUT BUILDING, ASK WALTER ABOUT REHAB, ASK WALTER ABOUT LUNCH BOX--you can ask him about other things (even your Red Shirt), but the idea is to gain his trust by showing an interest in him and/or the building.  Then he will make a proposition--get him a 'drink' and he will let you in.  He will even tell you how to get the 'libation'.  You'll have to get it from Brockwood's!

- BROCKWOOD'S

Then you go into Brockwood's Store--he will take your backpack--don't worry, you won't need it here, and you'll get it back once you leave.  Go northwest to the Fitting Room.  Look in the mirror there--push the mirror, then voila, you can enter the back room (the locked door in the sales area leads to it, but you can't use that door).  There is a desk there, with a waste basket next to it.  You'll need to get into the large drawer, this is where Brockwood hides his booze.  (By the way, I encourage you to look at everything that seems interesting in this game!)  Look in the waste basket for the key.  Read the ledger that's in the drawer--to feel better about stealing his gin.  For an interesting excursion, try sitting in the swivel chair, and SPIN CHAIR.  You'll get the key to the hatch in the ceiling, to get on the roof--this will remind you of the trampoline that is there, and the location of the Red Shirt.  Though you don't really need anything up here.  Now go back down through the Fitting Room and into the store, with the gin bottle--surprisingly, Brockwood will allow you to leave with his bottle--he's really trying to give it up.

- THE BAIT AND SWITCH

But really, you have no intention of giving a bottle of real gin to an alcoholic.  The game won't let you!  You'll have to make Walter 'think' that it's real gin.  From Brockwood's Front, go south then west to Business Parking, then northwest to Brockwood's Nook--there's a water tap there.  POUR OUT the gin bottle, then TURN ON WATER TAP, and FILL BOTTLE WITH TAP.  Don't worry about opening or closing the bottle, that's automatic.  Then go back to Walter in Vestibule (SE, E, E, E, N) and give him the bottle.  He'll assume it's real because you obviously got it from Brockwood, he won't ask questions, he'll leave, giving you his nametag.  You can now enter the building, but there's one more item you'll need--go back out to Gravel Lot, go NE, and pick up the lantern there.  Now turn it on and you have light.  Now go through the Vestibule into the Cluttered Passage, you'll find the roll of duct tape and a newspaper page--which you'll want to look at (please take all take-able items, they will all fit in the backpack).

- THE SCIENCE LESSON

As you go into the Auditorium, you'll notice a hatch way up in the ceiling--it's open!  If you guessed that your Red Shirt is on the roof beyond this hatch, you're correct!  You'll need to figure out how to get up there.  The key is LEVERAGE.  The newspaper page gives some clue--you're going to put together something that will help you get up there--if only to get your shirt.  Try some things--turn on the spigot, turn it off, turn on the 'engine', turn it off--just to get a 'feel' of what you're about to do (Don't worry, Walter won't come back until after you 'do your thing' here, no matter how long it takes)--already there is what is called an Archimedean Screw, this is your base power source.  Now, go west into the Dim Front--you'll find a scaffold, examine it--better yet, look at it through the binoculars.  Now PUSH SCAFFOLDING EAST. The scaffolding has a yardstick on top, with a 5-gallon bucket tied to the end, and it's held down up there by a statue--a precarious balance--try to think of what would throw this balance off?  LEVERAGE.  Fill that bucket, and the statue will topple.  What can fill it--because you cannot reach it--??  The engine.  You'll need to PUSH SCAFFOLDING TO ENGINE.

So, how could the statue toppling be useful to you??  You could PUSH SEESAW TO SCAFFOLDING--but there's one more thing.  You might not get enough LEVERAGE to vault you through the hatch (and yes, you are going to be on the seesaw). TURN CRANK CW(or CLOCKWISE)--try both directions to get a 'feel' for how it works.  What happens?  A bathtub appears, suspended by a chain.  Look at it, better yet with the binocs.  You'll find that if you turn the crank CW, the bathtub gets nearer to the engine--CC(or COUNTERCLOCKWISE) makes it go the other direction.  You'll want the tub to be next to the scaffolding, so TURN CRANK CW until the tub almost buts up against the scaffolding.  Let the messages guide you.  Your final addition will be the seesaw--PUSH SEESAW TO STAGE EDGE--you don't want it to be directly under the tub.

Now, all you have left to do is put some energy through this system.  And you--the Artist--are going to be the vital fifth element.  Get your stuff together--everything in the backpack, close it up, put it on your back, put the staff through the straps.  You won't need the lantern beyond this room, so you can drop it here.  Now turn on the spigot, turn on the engine--you have a generous five moves to get on the seesaw.

Now let it sing!

If all went well, you are back in Kitchen--having gone through the hatch--but not before seeing Walter charge back in--snatched your Red Shirt, crossed the street (albeit in the air), bounced off of the trampoline and through your own back window.  You've come full-circle!  Don't worry about the police that are now in that Gravel Lot (Walter called them), just avoid it.  You'll get thrown in jail anyway, which will be part of this journey, but I'd rather you do that part last (but if you want to go ahead and do it, go to the Gravel Lot or the police station and get yourself arrested by either having Walter's nametag on you or giving the nametag to the sergeant at the station--then skip ahead to BOB AND ROGER, and come back when done).

You can continue exploring, but you won't be able to get anywhere without interacting with Jerry, the Barber.  So---

JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT

If you're wondering why he is groping around, you can either look at the pictures on the walls, or in the hallway to the east of his Shop area--or just ASK JERRY ABOUT GLASSES.  He'll tell you that he tripped on the curb and they fell off and 'bounced off somewhere'.  Go to Corner Curb and look in the grating--that's where the glasses are.  Jerry is a bit self-absorbed, so you're going to have to figure this one out without his (conscious) help.  Your utility key will not help you open the grating--you're going to need something sharper or flatter.  You may have noticed the screwdriver in the barber chair..??  Of course, you can't just take the screwdriver in the presence of its possible owner, so you'll have to engage in a little subterfuge.  GET IN BARBER CHAIR--you'll automatically put down your backpack and other stuff.  You'll be surprised when Jerry pulls out your White Shirt(!), using it as a bib.  You'll have to play along here, because you won't be able to just take the shirt just now, Jerry is a bit stubborn.  Let him cut your hair, but while you are on the chair, TAKE SCREWDRIVER.  When he's finished, you'll be out of the chair again and you'll need to give him the $10 bill--declining the $2 change as a courtesy to him (you won't need it).  Then go to Corner Curb and PRY GRATING WITH SCREWDRIVER.  Then open it and take the glasses.  Play around with them for a while if you want, but they are useless to you--and the world to Jerry.  Give them to him, and you get--a ticket to Bunco Springs Amusement Park(BSAP), down the street.  But not your shirt...

Go east from the shop, into the bathroom, if you haven't already.  There is a sheet in the hole in the ceiling--you'll see it when you LOOK UP.  It's the source of the draft.  You'll need to get this sheet down.  Neither the sink nor the toilet are sturdy enough to stand on, so you'll have to get on the shelf--with the towel bar to hold on to.  Take the magazine off of the shelf, then take the towel--you'll need something to replace the sheet with--then GET ON SHELF.  Now take the sheet and see what it really is.  It's a barber bib!  Now put the towel in the hole--you will automatically spread the towel over the hole.  Now you can go back into the shop area and give the towel to Jerry.  Now he's a happy camper!  Plus, seeing his error, he gives you your shirt back!  Now you have your White Shirt.  And you're ready for the park!

THE PARK

You can do more exploring again, if you want.  If you go to the Demolished Building further south past the park, you'll see a yellow streamer hanging from the flagpole.  Using the binocs, once again, you discover it's your Yellow Shirt!  You won't be able to get it, yet, because you don't yet have the means to do so, however the sign in front of the building gives you a clue.  Now you should focus on the park, and what you CAN do.  Remember the suggestion about getting your spirits up and perhaps a ride will do the trick...??  Though you are supposed to be 'afraid of heights', but now you are so depressed that you don't care.  Anyway, go in through the Amusement Park Entrance, and give the ticket to Chester in the ticket trailer.  Feel free to get to know Chester and how much of a jerk he is.  You can do some exploring around the park, and even see the demolished building from another angle, at the end of the 'nature path'--go into the hole in the tower, go up the stairs--you'll see the Thinker, and the skylight up top--that's where the flagpole is rooted.  You won't be able to open this skylight or remove it, but tuck it away in your memory.

And be careful not to leave the park until after you get results--and you'll know it when you've done it.

If you tried to get on the roller-coaster, you'll notice no one is there to start the ride, you won't be able to start it, so nix the idea for now.  Really, the only other ride is the Wonder Wheel, manned by our friend Rex.  If you're feeling really sneaky, go to his car in the parking lot and LOOK IN REX'S CAR--you'll get a white paper bag--there's some stale popcorn in it so he won't mind..?? (In fact, if you don't take the bag, and you do the Wonder Wheel, he'll leave for lunch in his car, leaving the bag behind.)  Feel free to ask Rex about anyone you've met so far, even about important things.  Ask him about the duck, in fact ask him about the popcorn.  Ask Rex about himself.  Now have your binoculars in hand--or wear them--so he can see them--then GET INTO WHITE CAR--he'll see your binocs and tell you he'll stop the wheel once you get up top--this is crucial, as it's an important vantage point, and you'll get only one chance to do this.  Once he stops the wheel, you'll notice something--what's that clinging to the nearer loop on the roller-coaster??  LOOK AT BLUE SPLOTCH WITH BINOCULARS--that's your Blue Shirt!!  You'll have 6 moves to do this before the wheel starts up again, and you are back on ground level.  Feel free to use the remaining time to look at other things around you, with the binocs.

Now, you can go to the Kiddie Pond, and give the popcorn to the duck--he gives you a gift.  TAKE ROCK.  Perfect for throwing.  You'll realize its use when you get on the Crock Blocker!

When you are on the platform for the Blocker, you have six cars to choose from.  This is important--if you get on the wrong car, too far forward, you won't be able to catch your shirt as it floats by when you are doing the second loop.  In fact, if you get on the yellow car, you're doomed, because the bar on it is loose--avoid it (devilish grin)--get on the rear car, #6.  Don't forget to DROP your stuff before getting into the car.  Now when you are in the car, throw the rock at the green lever, and let the ride begin!  You won't have to type a command, just let the ride do its thing, you've made the important choices and now just sit and enjoy.  You'll catch your Blue Shirt near the end of the ride.

But you won't be able to rest yet...

Hear the ticking noise..??

SEARCH CONTROL BOOTH.  Now you have an incendiary device in the shape of a pipe.  Time is important here.  Don't worry about the whats and whys now, you'll need to put the pipe where it won't be of any danger to anyone, but perhaps more importantly, where it would be of use to you.  In fact, I encourage you to play around with it, have some fun, try giving it to people, etc etc.  Take advantage of SAVE and RESTORE.  You have 20 moves to get this right.  Think back carefully about where this device might be of use.  Seen any demolished buildings lately??

And have you been in the tower?  Third floor?

More crucially, remember your Yellow Shirt?? It's on the flagpole at the top of the tower.  You'll need to get this --shall I say, bomb--up there.  You'll need to somehow attach it to the skylight, so it will work properly--just leaving it in the room won't be effective enough.  Got the tape?  PUT TAPE ON PIPE.  Now, PUT PIPE ON SKYLIGHT--it will stick.  Now, high-tail it out of there, fast!

BOOOMMM...

Now, you've got 15 moves to do this right....and pay attention to what goes on, particularly after the bomb goes off...if you don't see these things, you won't know why you'll need to do certain things, particularly Chester's movements, and the hawk that flies over--you'll see all this if you are back in the park in time to hear the blast from there. Chester will run out of the trailer to get a look, and at the same time, a hawk will fly over, with 'something yellow' in its beak.  You'll see the hawk deposit it on top of the trailer, realizing it to not be food.  Chester meanwhile will run to his car to contact--the police?--on his wireless.  You'll need to get into the trailer and do 2 things--1) get your shirt from out of the skylight, and 2) develop evidence against Chester, because he's certainly got a leg up on you.

First thing's first--you won't be able to get into the trailer from the front window.  You'll have to go to the back of it, via BSAP Parking(go SE from there, or S from Main Exit).  Look under the trailer for the key.  Unlock the door there and you are in.  Your Yellow Shirt is there in the skylight--take it.  Now look at what Chester has left behind--particularly the notebook.  Read it.  Now take it.  Now get out of there, and wait for the police to show up.

You'll figure out that Chester has opportunistically framed you for the explosion--you would have been accused whether you set the bomb or not.  His diary is your proof that he set that bomb, intending for it to go off after the first ride on the Blocker.  With his diary in hand, you'll be exonerated for this felony, and let go, with your Yellow and Blue Shirts.  But if you have the nametag on you--Walter's--they will arrest you and put you in jail for the destruction of the other building (unless you've already gotten yourself arrested--if so, and you 'got results', skip ahead to NAP TIME.  Otherwise, read on).

On the other hand, if you don't have the diary, the game will end with you being thrown into the Big Clink--not the one at the police station.

THE DRUNK TANK

Yep, you're in the 'pokey'.  Walter has got his revenge.  There's nothing you can do here, essentially, except talk--but you have another 20 moves to do it in.  Get a look at your cell mates.  You'll find that only one is really sleeping.  Look at the one in the blue jacket.  He's lying awake.  Look at his jacket.  You may wonder why he is clutching his jacket and shaking.  Is it DTs??  ASK BLUE MAN ABOUT ANXIETY.  He'll loosen up--then you get a surprise!  Your Green Shirt pops out!

But you won't be able to get it right away.  It seems to hold some meaning for him.  You'll need to verbally give him some proof that you should have the shirt.  TELL BLUE MAN ABOUT RED SHIRT(or any other shirt you've already gotten--you'll automatically tell him about Natalie and missing all of the shirts, etc).  How hard was that?  Now you can use the remaining time to get to know Bob and his friend, ask him some questions, about people and things, in the cell, etc.  When the time is up, you'll all be escorted out of the cell and back into town.  You'll see Bob and Roger again, in action, so to speak.

You can return to town by going north from here.  If you have all the shirts, read on from here.  If you got only the Green and Red Shirts, go back to JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT.  If you got only the Green, Red and White Shirts, go back to THE PARK.

If you have gotten all the shirts, you'll be prompted to go home and take a nap.  Follow the messages and clues once you get there.  This is where we segue into what is essentially Part II of the game.

NAP TIME

Go to Natalie's room and GET ON NATALIE'S BED, because you'll want to feel closer to her--and, you've always wanted to know how comfortable her bed is.  Read all the clues.  When you wake up, you'll see her diary(!) laying on the bed next to your head.  Don't worry, it'll disappear only if you try to take it while off of the bed, or if you take it and then leave the bed--and it will reappear when you get back on the bed.  The only thing you need it for is for a password, and how and where to use it.  So READ DIARY.  You'll only see the words inside the front cover--pay attention--the 'magic word' will be one of five possible words, all beginning with 'f'--fooble, forsnook, finsteeth, frotzle or frachet--it was chosen at random at the start of the game, so it can be different if you restart at this point--you will not be able to use one of these words, even if you make the right choice, by chance, without first seeing it in the diary--if you try, you'll get a snarky response (but try it anyway).  And take her advice--remember to 'whisper' it.

THE SECRET ALCOVE 

Where is the alcove?  It's not her Nook out in the Living Room.  Remember the closet?  You'll have to have the light on and go deeper inside it.  Now, WHISPER (the magic word you found in the diary).  Surprise!  Go into that area.  Now look around, do whatever you want, look at the cards, learn about tarot.  Pick up the card on top of the deck.  Look at the cards in the spread.  You don't have to do these things, but I encourage you to read and explore.  Really, the important thing here is the mojo.  In fact, while you are here, if you listen long enough, Natalie's voice will spell out your next mission--find her and bring her mojo to her!!  Take the mojo, then step back out.

THE INVITATION

As soon as you step back into her room, you'll hear something like an engine running outside, and knock at the door.  Answer it.  YOU got a package, for a change.  But also, the mail has arrived.  Take the black box, and then go check your mailbox.  You'll have to sift through the junk mail 3 times before finding the important thing--it's an invite to your boss's party--TODAY.  And you'll need to go in your dress shoes--which you haven't got yet (they're on the list!).  But you decide that they'll have to take you in your office shoes, so put them on.  Wonder what's in the box??  Open it and look into it!  AHH!  Natalie's been KIDNAPPED.  That is, if you haven't already figured this out.  You'll notice some other strange things about this box/sphere.  It seems to tug you in certain directions.  Follow that.  It'll take you down Lookout Avenue--and while you're going down there, feel free to explore and look at things.  You're going to be late, anyway, so take your time.  Examine Mabel Maybre's--your landlady's--mansion across the street from you, take a walk down the street, go on the south side.  Look at the end of the street, past your boss's house--particularly the property with the small house, fenced in.  Now go to the party...

THE PARTY

When you arrive, finally, you'll see most of your co-workers leaving--you don't need them.  Go up and knock on the door.  If you have your invitation--and the office shoes on--you'll be grudgingly admitted, don't worry, this is the only possible way to get in.  Now you can spend all the time you want talking--or trying to talk--to John, Rick, Scottie, look around, etc., but at one point Scottie will be prompted to leave, and John goes upstairs for a nap.  You can spend all the time you want doing whatever you want, but what you should do is first go into the dining room where Richard is, and read the note on the counter.  John found some shoes, and had them thrown to the dog.  Were they yours??  In any case, you feel resentful.

Indulge your curiosity.  When John went upstairs, he left the rope detached.  So go on up!  Don't worry, his wife cannot stay in one place very long, she won't catch you or notice you.  Follow the snoring.  Now you're in John's room.  Stay quiet.  Look in the closet--gotcha!  Look at things.  You'll need to take two things--really three--the key from the drawer in the nightstand, and John's shoes.  Yep, John's shoes.  Be quiet about it!

Now go back down and onto the patio.  What do we do with the shoes??  Remember the note on the counter??  Now do unto John as he has done unto whoever those shoes belonged to.  Could be you, maybe not.  But be careful not to throw them directly at Ruffy.  You see, the sphere is pulling towards the doghouse, and you want to go in there without Ruffy knowing.  So you want to distract him a little.  Is there a tree, or a fence, in the other direction??  THROW JOHN'S SHOES AT TREE, or THROW JOHN'S SHOES OVER SHORT FENCE.  He'll get right after them.

Now the party's over for you, you must now go into the doghouse--you can look around there if you want, but you have 5 moves to unlock the gate with the key you found in John's room--or face Ruffy.  Look at the 'mass' you find there--take it for the points.  Now go--go south, then take the curious object you find on the ground nearby.  You're now at the vacant property next door--if you explored around the Raditch House before you came to the party, you'll realize that this is the house that was fenced in.  The sphere tugs you strongly in this direction, then breaks from your grasp and busts against the cellar doors outside the house, as you approach.

Obviously, you should go down in there...

NATALIE...??

You find Natalie tied into a chair in this cellar.  But not too tightly, as you find out, if you try to cut her bonds--with the strange 'handle'--which is a switchblade (aren't they illegal now?).  You can take the bandanna out of her mouth, and then UNTIE NATALIE.  You'll find out that she's not too conversational--time is of the essence.  What was your mission?  To give her the mojo.  So do it!

But you just can't....

You can try.  In fact, you can try three times.  Or not.

Either way, about 15 or so moves after you free her, you'll find out that she's really...

MABEL!  Your landlady!  And she becomes a giant bird!

And that the small house and cellar were just a mirage!

Before you have any time to think, Mabel flies up and takes you with her.  Why couldn't she just take the mojo??  Because it would reject her grasp.  But there's something about that she NEEDS, and it needs to be willingly given to her by its owner--which is the REAL Natalie.

LOCKED UP, AGAIN?

You wake up in a jail cell, tied--this time much more tightly--to a chair, bolted to the floor.  In a dark, mildewy jail cell underground.  You cannot do anything, you cannot get up.  But wait, what is that in your back pocket (assuming that you did pick up that strange 'handle' back at the vacant property?)??  Push the little button on the handle in the back pocket--it's a switchblade!  Cut the ropes with it.  Now you can get up--to find out that the cell door isn't locked.  You can now leave the cell and go west into the main area--but also collect all of your things from the dungeon alcove just beyond the cell.  Don't worry, all Mabel is interested in is the mojo, which you are still wearing because she cannot take it off of you.  Is this a dungeon, or is it a gym??  Because you see all this exercise equipment laying around.  You'll find out for sure about 15 moves from the time you entered the Exercise Room before Mabel comes down to toture you--and the game ends. Try some of it out, if you want, but what you want to do is open the 'steam bath' and pick up the alabaster key from the floor inside it.  You'll need it later.  If you want some laughs, SAVE your position, and try some of the other equipment!

Now what you have left to do, here, is leave through the hatch overhead.  Now you are at Base of Mountain--pick up the plastic stick that you find there, it's a phosphorescent light stick--BREAK STICK for a light source.  You'll need to go east over to the oak tree fast--you have 5 moves from the time you emerged from the hatch before Mabel spots you.  Once you get to the tree, you won't have to worry about Mabel again--for now.

NIGHTSCAPE

Now from Tree Base, the only way you can go is UP.  You can wear the light stick on your wrist, and put everything you have in your backpack, wear it, and then WEAR STAFF (in case you haven't yet found out, the staff can be slid through the straps and worn in this way).  Now go UP the tree.  You are immediately presented with three branches going in northerly directions--north, northeast and northwest.  Which one is correct??  You can try them if you want.  But look around.  There is a hollow behind you--look into it!  There, you find a leather whip!  Read the tag--'From the One That Got Away'.

Also, there's another branch--overhead.  SWING WHIP AT STRONG BRANCH.  Then SWING ON WHIP.  Bombs away!!

Your way from here is pretty well cut and dried--you're on the other side of the fence, so you can follow the path around the mountain, and then into the cave--which is a tunnel that goes into the heart of the mountian.  Now go into the door--after picking up the piece of paper lying there.  Now you are in a strange place...

BLACK AND WHITE

This is just an abstract piece of interactive fiction that I decided to write into the game...

Now you are in the center of a perfectly white room with a huge black dot--there is even a sign indicating where you are!  If that's not enough, the piece of paper you have also has a huge black dot--this is a map, of sorts, showing you where you are.  Again, you can walk around, examine, explore all you want.  Use the white key that you got from the exercise room to unlock the white door, go into the room with the desk and examine the huge book that you find there--it's a ponderous tome written by Rene Decartes.  What is perhaps his most famous saying?  'I think, therefore I am'.  So we come to the one thing you need to do here.  Think.  But you need to do this in the right place.  Go where you feel most 'centered'--on The Dot.  Now--guess.  

THINK.

ON THE MOUNTAIN

Now you are on the terrace near the top of North Mountain.  Don't worry about getting off the mountain or back where you were.  And don't worry--yet--about Mabel.  Examine the fire--what's in it?  You have about 5-7 moves to take your nametag from the flames.  That's the last thing on your list!  You get the points.  Put the nametag on, because it's an important identity symbol.  Now you can look around and examine things there on the terrace.  Specifically, examine the hole on the side--what do you notice just over the side, near the hole?  A cave entrance, on a lower level.  You'll need to get down there.  How?  It's a precarious climb, and there are no hand-holds.  Seven symbols of your identity will be needed to help you climb down there.  You're already wearing one--the nametag--as a sort of bolster to your courage.  Now, what do you have that can fit into the hole?

Your staff.  PUT STAFF IN HOLE.

Now, you're going to have to make a rope--with the remaining five things.

The shirts.  It doesn't matter what order you tie them in, you can do it this way--TIE RED SHIRT TO WHITE SHIRT.  TIE BLUE SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE YELLOW SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE GREEN SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  Or however.

Now you have a long rope.  Obivously, you can TIE ROPE TO STAFF.  Voila!

Remember to be wearing your nametag before you go.  Now, DOWN....

You are now in front of the cave entrance, on a narrow ledge.  The only way to go is into the entrance, south.

You find--NATALIE!--but she's lying down with her hands tied.  She notices you--listen to her--she IS the real Natalie.  Cut her bonds with the switchblade--you won't be able to untie the leather string.

Another surprise!  (And don't worry, you did everything correctly up to here.)

Now you have TWO Natalies!  Is this a good thing??  No, because one of them is Mabel!

Now ask either one of them anything!  Try anything!  Have fun!  You won't be able to tell which one is which, no matter what you do or ask--but listen to what they say.  The crucial thing is knowing which one to give the mojo to.  After about 20 moves from the time you freed the real Natalie, one of them will say something interesting.  Remember the 'magic word' from earlier?  She will say that word, to which the other will say 'Oh bullhockey, honey, don't listen to her!  She's nuts!'  Which ever one, the Natalie on the left, or the Natalie on the right, that said the 'magic word' is the one that you should give the mojo to!  (Like the magic word, which Natalie is the correct one is not necessarily the same in each complete game playing.)  Now watch the pyrotechnics!

GETTING HOME

Natalie has now flown you both back down to the ground, but beyond that point, she is not exactly going to hold your hand on the way home.  Really there is only one route you can go--she will not let you turn back.  Listen to her as you pass the Goblins, Inc. shop--an important suggestion.  You are now on Center Street--but now it's night time and you are heading south to the corner at Rex's--you've been here before, but just during the day when it wasn't so active.  Now turn west--you are now at the Alley Entrance, again.  You see two pairs of feet sticking out of the alley--EXAMINE FEET, for another surprise!  It's your two buddies from the jail cell!  Natalie looks none too patient, but she'll need to wait for a bit, because this is a very important encounter--a key conversation.  You have 20 moves to tell them about the right things.

They want to know how your quest is going.  Now TELL BOB ABOUT one of the following--Natalie, Mabel, the kidnapping, the shirts, the rescue.

Bob will then 'confer with his cohort' and in moments, this results in him donating their jackets to you and Natalie.  You get Bob's jacket, because, with your bald pate, you look more like him, and Natalie gets Roger's jacket--and she gets the fedora--with her hanging on your neck, this makes you two look like the two of them, with Bob toting Roger to their lodgings for the night, at the apartments.

Now all you have to do is get home.  Literally.  Continue west to Lookout Avenue Apartments, go south into the gate, and go back to the apartment.  Your disguise fools the giant bird hovering around the mountain to the north, until the hat blows off of Natalie--just as you get inside the gate.  Then Mabel spots her and as the two of you start running, the gate begins to close.  Crazy Mabel doesn't notice this, as intent as she is, and just as she swoops down, the gate closes!  Game over for her!

And for you.

Thank you for playing my game, and as the ending says, look out for 'Bullhockey 2!"

At the time of the walkthrough creation, this game could be played at

Since actions are timed, you have 20 seconds between run or jump
actions; if you don't take one of these actions every 20 seconds, you'll
freeze to death. So if you're a slow typist, you may want to add "jump"
as needed.

Het doel van het spel is om een grote schat te vinden.

Het verhaal  begint in je eigen huis. Daar kun je een briefje 
oppakken. In het briefje staat hoe je de commando's in kunt 
typen. Als je door het raam klimt, zul je de schep vinden. Als 
je naar je slaapkamer gaat, zul je een kleine, brandende 
lantaren vinden. Het is ook mogelijk om een tukje in je bed te 
doen. Verder is hier nu nog niets te doen, dus ga weer terug 
naar de kamer. In het oosten is een hal, waar een sneetje 
brood, een fles melk en een munt liggen. Ook staat er een 
mooie houten kist. Als je de kist beter bekijkt, zul je een 
vreemde inscriptie ontdekken. Misschien is het handig als je 
die inscriptie even opschrijft. Misschien ook niet.

Nu kun je je huis verlaten en naar buiten gaan. Je staat dan 
midden in het dorp, en je ziet de herberg en in de verte een 
groot, eng kasteel. Ga de herberg binnen. Ga zitten en luister. 
Je zult een aantal gasten horen praten. Luister dan nog een 
keer en de gasten zullen opstaan en ergens anders gaan zitten. 
Als je weer bent gaan staan, wil je natuurlijk de knoflook 
hebben. Maar je mag het niet pakken van de waard! De oplossing 
is dat je intypt "koop knoflook". Dan zal de waard het gewoon 
aan je geven. Typ dan "vraag waard" en hij zal je een trap 
naar de zolder laten zien. Ga naar de zolder. Daar tref je een 
kist aan die onder het stof zit. Blaas het stof weg, en er 
komt een oud boek te voorschijn. In dit boek staat hoe je 
vampiers kunt doden. Bekijk de rare steen ook eens goed... Je 
kunt ook het bloed op de grond onderzoeken, maar daar wordt je 
niet veel wijzer van. Ga weer naar beneden in de herberg. Als 
je in een agressieve bui bent, kun je de waard in elkaar 
slaan, maar na een paar keer zal hij je doden en moet je 
opnieuw beginnen. Daarom is het handig als je het spel even 
opslaat voordat je hem gaat slaan. Dit doe je door 'bewaar 
spel' in te tikken. In de herberg is nu voorlopig niets meer 
te doen, dus we gaan naar het bos.

Als je weer buiten staat, ga dan het bos in. Nu moet je even 
ronddwalen (ga west, ga noord etc.) tot je bij een boomhut 
komt. Hier kun je de voetafdrukken bekijken, en dan in de boom 
klimmen. In de hut zul je een kapmes en een houten wig vinden. 
Ga weer omlaag, en probeer voor de grap eens in de boom te 
snijden.

Ga dan het bos weer uit door weer op goed geluk allerlei 
richtingen op te lopen. Nu gaan we maar eens een kijkje nemen 
in het kasteel!!

Als je het bos weer uit bent, ga dan naar het noorden en naar 
het kasteel. Als je een andere richting neemt, kom je weer in 
het bos. Als je voor het kasteel staat, kun je de tekst boven 
de ingang lezen en dan naar binnen gaan. Binnen zul je een 
harnas aantreffen. Als je erin wilt kruipen, moet je "trek 
harnas" intypen. Als je daarna "kijk vizier" typt, zul je 
vreemde dingen zien. Trek het harnas dan weer uit, want je 
kunt er nu nog niet mee bewegen. Je kunt het wel meenemen, 
maar laten staan voor later is ook goed. Je kunt namelijk 
maar een beperkt aantal spullen meedragen. Je moet dus goed 
opletten waar je dingen laat, zodat je ze later weer kunt 
ophalen als je ze nodig hebt. 

Er is hier een deur, maar als je daar door loopt, kom je in 
een kamer waar verder niets is te doen. Er is hier alleen 
een lange tafel met etensresten. Ga de kamer uit, en loop de 
trap op. Je staat voor slaapkamer 2, maar de deur is niet 
open te krijgen. Als je naar het westen gaat, kom je bij 
slaapkamer 1. Als je die ingaat, kun je naar een balkon. Als 
je daar van af springt, ben je dood. Ga slaapkamer 1 weer 
uit, en loop weer naar het oosten. Je bent dan weer bij 
slaapkamer 2. Ga nu de nauwe gang zuidwaarts in. Je kunt 
hier verschillende kanten op. Als je de wenteltrap omhoog 
gaat, kom je in de kasteeltoren. Hier is een kist met een 
gesloten luik. Nu kun je die nog niet openen. Ga door het 
raam en je zult een waterbron in de verte zien. Vanaf nu kun 
je bij die waterbron komen in het bos. Ga weer omlaag en dan 
nog een keer omlaag. Je staat nu voor een geheimzinnige deur, 
waarop gebonkt wordt. Ook deze deur kun je nu nog niet 
openen. Als je weer omlaag gaat, kom je op de begraafplaats. 
Als het goed is, is hier een lange ladder. Neem die mee. Je 
kunt eventueel nog door het poortje gaan, om bij de graven 
te kijken. Ga weer door het poortje en ga omhoog. Ga nogmaals 
omhoog en zet dan de ladder neer, die zal tot het gat reiken. 
Klim de ladder op en je bent in de spionageruimte. Ga naar 
het oosten. Je kunt nog verder naar het oosten, maar daar 
loopt de gang dood. Ga terug en ga door het gat omlaag. Je 
komt in een ventilatieruimte, waar je verder niets kunt doen. 
Ga weer omhoog en twee keer naar het westen. Ga dan omhoog de 
uitgehouwen trap op en kijk door het gat. Je zult Dracula 
zien die in een kist stapt. Als je nog een keer kijkt zie je 
een dichte kist staan. Klaarblijkelijk zit Dracula daar in, 
maar vergis je niet. Als je weer naar beneden gaat via de 
ladder zul je hem tegenkomen. Je kunt proberen hem te slaan, 
schoppen of doden, maar dat haalt niets uit. Hij zal je 
altijd doodbijten. Nee, de truc is dit: typ "schijn dracula", 
en gooi dan de knoflook. Dracula zal met een plof verdwijnen, 
maar hij is nog niet dood!

Neem de ladder mee en ga nu het kasteel weer uit, - let op! 
De deur valt nu dicht en kan niet meer open!- en ga naar het 
dorp. Je kunt nu naar de waterbron. Gooi de duivelaarsmunt 
in de waterbron, en vul de fles met het giftige, blauwe 
water dat nu is ontstaan. Je kunt de munt ook weer meenemen 
als je dat wilt. Als je behoefte hebt om nogmaals op de 
zolder van de herberg te kijken, dan kan dat. Maar de waard 
zal je er niet langs laten. Als je hem de munt geeft, wordt 
hij weer wat rustiger en kun je op zolder kijken. Hier is 
echter nog steeds niets te vinden. Ga weer naar je eigen 
huis en naar de slaapkamer. Als je nu gaat slapen, zul je 
midden in de nacht wakker worden door gebonk onder je bed. 
Schijn met de lamp onder je bed en je ziet een open luik 
zitten. Ga omlaag door het luik. Je zult een doosje en een 
bijl aantreffen. Open het doosje en je vind een hamer. Pak 
de bijl en ga weer omhoog. Ga naar het bos en zoek weer naar 
de boomhut. Hak nu met de bijl een stuk hout uit de boom, 
en raap dat op. Snij nu met het mes in het hout en het zal 
de vorm van een kruis krijgen. Je kunt voor de lol met de 
bijl ook huis gaan houden in de herberg. Als je de bijl 
gooit zal de waard hem weer terug smijten enz.

Ga weer naar je huis en zet de ladder neer onder het gat 
boven je. Beklim de ladder en pak het touw dat daar ligt. 
Ga weer omlaag, neem de ladder mee en ga naar je slaapkamer. 
Kruip weer door het luik onder je bed. Pak de hamer en 
graaf met de schep naar het noorden tot je op iets hards 
stoot. (De bijl heb je overigens niet meer nodig, evenals 
het mes, de lamp en de knoflook. Zorg dat je in ieder geval 
de hamer en de wig hebt, het touw en de fles met giftig 
water.) Duw  de steen weg en ga door het ontstane gat. Je 
bent nu weer in het kasteel en je stuit op de doodskist van 
Dracula. Open de kist en de klok zal twaalf uur slaan door 
je pc speaker. Dracula opent de ogen en zal wegvluchten. 
Typ nu telkens "volg dracula", totdat hij niet verder gaat 
en hij voor je komt staan. Tijdens je achtervolging zul je 
merken dat je nu wel door het luik kunt gaan van de kist, 
die eerst dicht zat. Je komt dan in slaapkamer 2 waar je 
eerst niet in kon. Maar goed, Dracula staat op het punt je 
weer aan te vallen. Als je de knoflook en de lamp nu zou 
gebruiken haalt het niets meer uit. Nee, nu moet je het 
houten kruis tonen. Dracula zal angstig tegen de muur 
opkruipen en de handen voor zijn ogen slaan. Sla dan de wig 
met de hamer door zijn hart en Dracula is dood!!!! Zijn 
lijk zal tot stof vervallen en je kunt nog net het woord 
'incoronium' lezen. Vergeet ook niet om de gouden halsband 
op te rapen die hier ergens ligt.

Ga nu naar de kamer waar stond "Dit is Sesam". Typ nu de 
toverspreuk in die het lijk van Dracula achterliet en de 
deur zal opengaan. Je komt nu oog in oog te staan met een 
gevaarlijke spin. Ook hier kun je proberen haar te doden maar 
dat lukt niet. Je moet de fles met giftig water kapot gooien. 
De spin zal dan het water opdrinken en sterven. Als je 
rondkijkt, zie je een vuur in deze kamer. Als je er doorheen 
loopt, ga je dood. Je zult het harnas aan moeten trekken. 
(Als je het niet bij je hebt, moet je het gaan halen) Je zult 
merken dat je je nu opeens wel kunt bewegen in het harnas. 
Loop door het vuur heen en je komt in de geheime schatkamer. 
Hier staat een kist vol met gouden munten. Als je de kist 
oppakt zal het kasteel gaan schudden en beven. Het wordt tijd 
dat je je uit de voeten gaat maken.

Als je weer terug bent gegaan door het vuur, moet je naar de 
plek waar de doodskist van Dracula stond. Gooi alle voorwerpen 
die je bij je hebt weg, en pak de doodskist op. Ga nu naar 
slaapkamer 1 en naar het balkon. Knoop daar het touw vast, ga 
omlaag via het touw en zet de doodskist neer. Kruip nu in de 
doodskist en je zal met kist en al van de heuvel afglijden, zo 
het dorp in. Als je weer uit de kist bent gestapt heb je het 
spel uitgespeeld. Je kunt nu gaan genieten van al je geld. 
Hoewel. Er lopen nog meer mannen rond in lange, zwarte 
jassen...

NB: Het is mogelijk bepaalde handelingen in een andere volgorde 
te doen, en voorwerpen op andere plaatsen te laten etc.

Walkthrough for "Dracula - Prince of Darkness" by Paul T. Johnson

Note, while this will get you from beginning to end, you'll need to do
considerably more EXAMINEs and LOOKs if you want to enjoy the full
effect of the game. Also, most of the timed puzzles are unforgiving of
any errors, so if you make a mistake, be sure to undo right away (or you
can wait to see the death first). Save frequently.

ZORK - aka DUNGEON - circa 1977, Mainframe (final version)
-------------------------------------------------------
GREAT WEBSITE:
http://zork3point2b.blogspot.com/2013/03/chapter-1-box-full-of-letters-wilco-1995.html
http://zork3point2b.blogspot.com/2013/11/appendix-4-this-song-george-harrison.html


FUN NOTES:
All purpose Gunk - fix leak in the dam from pushing the Blue Button
the Coffin - you can carry it out across the ravine and down the slide, or you can visit the room, and let the thief transport it all the way to his hideout - YEAH!  Turn the tables and make the thief work like a dog before you slit his throat. (After all, your crimes are quickly adding up:  trespassing, breaking&entering, stealing, killing, and probably caused massive flood destruction downriver too!)

This faux "Granite Wall" has no use...others might, but as the InvisiClues for Zork I stated, "Evidently the ancient Zorkers did not have strong truth-in-advertising laws. Take nothing for granite." 

Who is that Ugly Person staring back at me in the MIRROR room?
ARAGAIN Falls  -->  Backwards?  NIAGARA

Have you ever:
 - read lettering (in the Living Room)
 - look at blue cake through flask (and others)
 - eat the different cakes!
 - examine the portrait of Flathead, and the bills, coin, stamp
 - try digging with the shovel in the bat guano 
 - try to keep digging on the sandy shore
 - get in the barrel and say "GERONIMO" over the falls
 - wave stick again while walking on the rainbow
 - try to take the bat
 - walk into stinky room with torch
 - the water can also be used to cool the bell if you need to ring it again
 - examine stamp (Balloon area)
 - try floating to the top of the volcano
 - read the card after detonating explosives
 - look into any sphere (after you've put all 3 in the case!!)
 - IF YOU DIE... maybe pray at an altar for forgiveness?
 - in the temple... you can go to the treasure room:  TREASURE
 - opened the grating from beneath while the leaves were still on it?
 - tried swearing?
 - tried anything mean to the bodies in Hades?
 - burned the black book?
 - damaged the painting?
 - lit the candles with the torch?
 - read the matchbook?
 - play violin / play violin with sword
 - tried to take yourself (or the Thief, Troll, or Cyclops)?
 - tried cutting things with the knife or sword?
 - poured water on something burning?
 - said WAIT or SCORE or PRAY while dead (as a spirit)?
 - count (blessings, matchbook, candles, leaves, bills)
 - examine me
 - brush teeth
 - brush teeth with gunk (open tube and take gunk)
 - oil sword with water
 - make wish (at top of barrel with coins in hand)
 - attack cretin with sword
 - poke cyclops
 - send for brochure after you already get the stamp
 - burn brick, leaves, wire, bills
 - JUMP (from top of well)
 - kick the bucket (ie. the well)  haha
 - attack master with sword (ENDGAME)
in DREARY ROOM
  > look through window  
    The door is open, dummy.
 
Words you may not have tried:
  HELLO (by itself, and also to Cretin, Troll, Thief, Cyclops and objects)
  OIL (lubricate)
  XYZZY
  PLUGH
  ZORK
  DUNGEON
  SKIP
  FIND (especially with house, hands, teeth, cretin, grue)
  CHOMP
  COUNT (treasure, blessings, matchbook candles, leaves, bills)
  WIN

  MUMBLE (or SIGH)
  REPENT
  YELL (or SCREAM)
  SMELL

  NOOBJ
  FOO
  BAR

  BACK
  FROBOZZ
  SCHEDULE
  TIME
  DIAGNOSE

NOTE:  In some versions, the elvish sword can be referred to as "Glamdring" or "Orcrist"  

DON'T FORGET - type "score" once you get the full 616 points!

EXITS from UNDERGROUND:
1.  Trap Door (Cellar)
2.  Chimney  (Studio)
3.  Grating  (Maze - unlock with rusty keys)
4.  Pray     (Altar)
5.  Hole in Living Room Wall (Strange Passage)
6.  Over the Rainbow (Climb back up the Canyon)

LAMP BATTERIES:  Lasts about 325 turns

BALLOON RIDE:  The guidebook burns longest... otherwise you will need to burn a few different items (newspaper, leaflets, labels, brochures).

ENDING TEXT:
[Treasury of Zork] This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste. To judge from its contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.

There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.

In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and other informative and inspiring works.

On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground Empire, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure, and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.

On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.

As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon Master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things. Long have I waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!" He taps you lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells, and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped. For a moment there are two identical images staring at each other among the treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

Enchanted Castle (enchcast.zip)
----------------

You started in a medieval castle without any knowledge about it. You are to
escape the castle. There are three missions you might also want to do to
complete the wholestory of this beautiful text adventure game.

Walkthrough:
East: One of the torch is not firmly attached. Get it. This would be your
      only light source
West: Great Hall. There is a magic word written here. Some other areas
      would bring you back to here whenever this magic word is spoken.
      There are also other magic words. To distinguish it, we would refer
      this as return magic word.
Up,Up: There is a painting here.
      Try to get it. Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west
West: Prison cell
      There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them
      appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.
      You are trapped. But don't worry, you have the return magic word.
      so... You are back to Great Hall

Try to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,
and east where you can light it again. If you come to a place where there
is a sign "Abandon Ye..." on the west door then north, south, and west would
allow you to pass the west door. If you are ready then:

   menagerie, play oboe. You put him on sleep

   north (cruciform), east. There is a magic word that whenever is spoken
   somewhere else, everything there would be disappeared. So south, and say
   the magic word.

   you come to the nursery room, west. Notice the furnace? unlock it,
   open it, and you can get the Star
8. Exploring rooms behind hall of dragon
   Go to catacomb east of it. Southeast. Northeast. Keep trying to go to
   northeast until you found a bridge. Cross it. You would find a chained

   keys from you. Unless you have had the star of diamond, you won't need
   them anymore. East, north, west on the edge of a pit. Down. You entered
   a Zimbu house (This one too is just like the basilisk will be after you).

Walkthrough for A Very Hairy Fish-Mess
A Hideous Holiday Horror by Byron Alexander Campbell

This game was my attempt at a more traditional IF, with compass directions and puzzles to solve and plenty of ways to die.  It goes without saying that in this walkthrough I've included only the moves necessary to win, but experimentation should be rewarded, whether it's in the form of a funny response or a grisly death.  Taking and eating things are most likely to yield a unique response.  It's not supposed to be an unforgivingly hard game, but there may be a few rare parts where the puzzles are too opaque or the parser asks for too specific a command; if you run into this, you can curse my programming inexperience to the seventh generation, and hopefully this guide will help move things along.  Oh, and Merry Fishmas!

                              Walkthrough for

                            Getfeldt's Treasure

                             by Mike Salisbury

                           Written by Richard Bos


  First, some notes. 
  
  To start with, this is an MS-DOS game written in Quick Basic, and a port of
an original for the even earlier Tandy Color. This shows, sometimes badly.
Technically, the program is rather restrictive. There are no command recall
facilities, not even the ones used by the DOS command line. At least capitals
are accepted, but never significant. The most unpleasant lack, though, is that
you cannot save your game. At least it's not very long.
  As far as vocabulary is concerned, it has what it needs and nothing more.
Only the first three letters of a word are significant, except where they
aren't - see below. Some abbreviations are recognised, and some are required;
specifically, "east" is only recognised as a full word in "go east", not on its
own. You'll have to use "e". This one limitation is not very onerous, of
course. Also, you can't use "it".
  Another limitation is that this program is very bad for guess-the-verb. At
times, it even needs guess-the-exact-command. Synonyms are not common. "Get"
and "Take" will both work, and that's about it except where a special case has
been accounted for. But those pre-defined commands have their foibles, one of
which is is that they do not always recognise abbreviated words. Some work with
a three-letter abbreviation but not with a four-letter one. Some demand the
entire noun but allow the verb to be abbreviated; some do not. Using the entire
words in all commands would be best, which makes it all the more inconsistent
that "east" is not recognised on its own. And, of course, where I've used "the"
below to make the text read better, omit it.
  Those special cases have another problem: they are not accepted except in the
very circumstances for which they have been anticipated. Everywhere else they
will be treated as if you typed nonsense, or give a non-committal message such
as "nothing happens" where "that is not here" would be a more appropriate.
Similarly, "look object" and "read object" are not the same thing even where
they should be - in at least one case, "look object" says "nothing to be read",
but "read object" tells you what is written on it!
  Real bugs are, as far as I have found, rare. That is to say, bugs which
affect gameplay seem rare. You need to be careful not to lose your dog before
you get him - that seems to be all. Cosmetic bugs are much more common. One or
two messages seem incomplete, but the most common bug is that room descriptions
remain static when they shouldn't - objects remain in view when you take them,
that sort of thing. Misspelled words are also common.
  Finally, since this is a walkthrough, spoilers are rife below. I'm not taking
you past every single clue and sight - in fact, I'm not taking you past any.
All code numbers I'll be giving you can be found in the game somewhere. As
mentioned above, the Look and Read commands are not always helpful, but they do
occasionally reveal something useful. Therefore, look at everything before you
resort to this walkthrough, and if you accidentally read the solution to a
problem you hadn't come across yet, don't blame me.

  Now, let's go and get that treasure.  


  You start in Getfeldt's garden. Go east, take the crowbar, and go west and
south. Use the crowbar. (Yes, "use". Tsk, tsk... naughty implementor.) Drop the
crowbar. Open door, go east and north. Move the painting. You're asked for a
combination, which is 121513. Yes, a hint this can be found elsewhere in the
game. No, I'm not telling you where. Serves you right for reading walkthroughs.
Take and wear the amulet.
  Go s, s, e. Open the refrigerator ("fridge" is not recognised) and take the
steak. Go east. Now (and you must enter this as one command, nor will you be
allowed to proceed until you do) "give steak". Get the treats, and give treat.
If you now check your inventory, you'll find that you are carrying the dog!
  Pull the lever and go down. Take the gear and the balloon. Go east twice.
Unlock the door - the code is 6603243e. Go east twice more, then north and up.
Start the engine and set the navigation. You'll be asked for the coordinates,
which are 121.15.09:34.09.12 - and you've already come across these, although
I haven't told you explicitly where to find them. 
  Go east twice. Wear your gear, then go down and north. First turn the wheel,
then the handle. Go east. Close the door, and when asked which, enter /~\I
(slash, tilde, backslash, single I: the "one" version of the visible door's
"two"). Now "push green". Do not "push green pad" - that doesn't work. Turn
the cross.
  Go east, look shelf, take batteries, go east, take flashlight. Go south. Put
batteries in flashlight. Drop the flashlight, batteries (yes, you have to drop
them individually even though you just put them in the flashlight), balloon,
gear and treats. Go west. Put amulet in star, get chest, go east. No, all your
stuff hasn't disappeared. It's still here, it's just not shown in the room
description.
  Take the gear and balloon - leave the rest. Go back n, w, w. Take the net.
Wear the gear. Close the door - enter /~\II, that is, slash, tilde, backslash,
double I - push red and go west. Put chest in net. Attach net. You'll be asked
"to what" - enter "ring", as a single word. Don't ask me why this command could
not be handled in the same way as "put object in object", but if you try that,
you get told to "slow down". Pull the tab.


  Hooray - you have beaten Getfeldt. Although there are messages spread around
the game which make it uncertain how much you've actually "beaten" him and how
much of it was his idea all along. In any case, you're now rich, so no matter
who was the mastermind, it counts as a victory for you!(version 1.0 of this walkthrough -- 11/12/03)

WALKTHROUGH FOR GHOST TRAIN
                -----------

_Ghost Train_, by Paul Johnson, is available at

http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/ghost.z8

(you may need to watch for line breaks in the above URL)

This file is a little discursive, including some actions which are not
necessary to complete the game. However, they should make the experience
more enjoyable. The exact phrases you will need to type into the
interpreter are in ALL CAPS.

This walkthrough is based on
Release 4 / Serial number 070503 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 


ON THE FIRST TRAIN
------------------

Basically your goal is to wait around a few turns. READ NEWSPAPER, TALK
TO INGRID, KISS INGRID, and be sure to X INGRID. She's wearing a
necklace; X NECKLACE. You can take INVENTORY and X TICKET too. Whatever
you do, after a few turns there will be an accident.

AFTER THE ACCIDENT
------------------

Now you're in "blackness. A sleepy unconscious state." You want to WAKE.

Look at the wreckage! No, really, LOOK AT WRECKAGE. You can X BODIES, X
DEBRIS, SEARCH BODIES, and SEARCH DEBRIS too, but it won't get you
anything nifty. Instead go SOUTH. (You could go north, but it would only
take you to an endless set of tracks, so why bother?) X LIGHT and X BOX
here, then go WEST, UP, and WEST again to enter the signal box. You'll
see a ghostly train go by beneath you, but you don't have to worry about
it.

Well, you were looking for a phone, so X PHONE and it tells you how to
use it. TURN HANDLE for some more atmosphere. Next, look at other things
around you. X NECKLACE (look familiar?), X COIN, X LEVER, X PANEL. You
can GET the COIN and NECKLACE. You can PULL and PUSH the LEVER, but I
don't think it does anything useful. Notice that the panel is loosely
attached--PULL PANEL, then LOOK to see what you've uncovered. GET KEY.

That's all here, so EAST, DOWN, and EAST to get back to the tracks. The
strange figure you saw earlier has left a lamp. X LAMP and GET IT. Go on
to the SOUTH. You can X WALLS and X LICHEN for some more atmosphere, and
you can even X WATER and DRINK WATER. Then go SOUTH again.

See the writing on the door? READ WRITING. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY and
go WEST into...

THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY
-----------------------

Go NORTH so you can interact with things.

X CLOCK, X POSTERS, READ SIGN. Notice that the train comes at 10:30 and
the clock thinks it's 10:24 right now. Then go NORTH into the waiting
room.

The ghost will call your name, but you can ignore it for a moment. X
BOOKS, READ BOOKS, READ NEWSPAPER, X SOFA, SIT ON SOFA will all give you
more atmospheric messages. Then you can deal with the ghost. X WINDOW
and wait a turn, then the ghost asks "Fares Please". Then X GHOST. He
wants you to buy a ticket, so GIVE COIN TO GHOST.

Okay, notice the clock is ticking again--at 10:30 the train will be out
at the track. But spare a second to X TICKET to see where you're
going... a cemetery... brrr. Then go SOUTH and wait until the train
arrives. Once it does, go SOUTH again to enter it.

ON THE SECOND TRAIN
-------------------

Pay attention to the colors of the carriages here, and write them down
in order. It will come in handy later.

In room #1 (the westernmost room) is a red door which is locked. In room
#6 is a locked door.

Also in that room is a Ouija board. If you hang around a moment, the
spirits will spell out "HELP US" on the board. X BOARD--you can ask it
about things just as though it were a real person. Sometime about now,
you may get strange messages about mice running through the room, or you
may hear footsteps on the roof of the train. That's okay. It's just
random atmospheric stuff.

Go ahead and ASK BOARD ABOUT whatever you can think of, including: ME,
TRAIN, GHOST, TICKET. But to continue, you must ASK BOARD ABOUT INGRID,
and the door to your east will open. Go EAST and be confronted by a dead
man rotting. Make sure you read his description carefully, especially
the mention of his badge. You can't actually interact with him yet,
though. Notice the key--X BLACK KEY and GET IT. *Now* you've woken up
the dead guy. GIVE TICKET TO GHOST and he'll leave you alone.

Return to room #1 (go WEST six times) and UNLOCK DOOR WITH BLACK KEY.
Then go WEST twice to enter the train's cab. You'll see a bunch of
controls, which you may want to fiddle with yourself before continuing
with this walkthrough.

Your goal is to get the train to stop. The brake wheel looks
promising--TURN BRAKE WHEEL. That slowed it, but didn't stop it. PULL
LEVER to finish the job. Then DOWN to get out of the train.

CEMETERY AND CHAPEL
-------------------

Go NORTH to the cemetery proper. X STONES and it mentions a particular
inscription. READ INSCRIPTION--you don't want it to be true, but it is.
Ingrid's gone. Unless... NORTHWEST takes you to a fairy dance. X
DANCERS, and then go NORTH to the chapel.

X CHAPEL and NORTH takes you inside. X INSCRIPTION. X BIBLE and try to
GET IT. You can X PEWS and X LECTERN too, if you want. Then go EAST to
the bell room. An empty room, except for that rope. You can PULL ROPE to
ring the bell, but it doesn't do much for you. X ROPE hints at the
proper thing to do... You want to CLIMB ROPE.

(I like to PULL ROPE again when I'm at the top of it, right next to the
bell. But then, I read Dorothy Sayers' _Nine Tailors_.)

The language here is a little weird. GET PARCHMENT and then X PARCHMENT.
X BOOKS tells you to search for things by name... You saw the name of
the church is St. Gorgon (although it was spelled differently), so
SEARCH GORGON and GET EXORCISM. READ EXORCISM for some colorful
language, but nothing else of use. CLIMB ROPE to get back down ("down"
doesn't work, for some reason). WEST and SOUTH to leave the chapel.

Now, you want to go around back. So NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST. X GARGOYLE
and READ INSCRIPTION. Aha, a clue. Go back to the dancers by going
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, then SOUTH. Then ASK DANCERS ABOUT GARGOYLE. The
dancer will kiss you, so I like to KISS DANCERS in return. Then go back
to the chapel and do what the dancers said--three times around,
counterclockwise. You'll end up in back of the chapel having a chat with
Satan.

He asks who dares to call him back; TELL SATAN ABOUT ME. You've only got
one thing on your mind, so ASK SATAN ABOUT INGRID. Uh-oh, is there any
way to save her? ASK SATAN ABOUT HELL. (If this is clued, I don't know
where.) Obviously you have to answer "YES". Satan gives you an hour (60
turns) to do what must be done.

You end up at a funeral service, before an open grave. There's no reason
to know this, but you have to ENTER OPEN GRAVE. DOWN takes you to a pair
of eyes, asking about you. TELL EYES ABOUT ME and then go WEST. X HOUND
to get his name. Pluto (and you can try to go down if you want, but
he'll stop you). Go back EAST and ASK EYES ABOUT PLUTO. Now it's safe to
go WEST and DOWN. DOWN again, and EAST to... yet another train.

THE THIRD TRAIN
---------------

X SWITCH to see which way the train is headed now (northeast), then UP
to enter the train.

OPEN BOX to get a message from Ingrid telling you your goal, then go
NORTH to this train's cab.

The controls are mostly the same as the other train, except that you
must turn the switch to face northwest first, using the colored levers.
Here's where the colors of the second train come in handy... Pull the
colored levers in the order that the carriages were colored in that
train (type PULL RED, PULL BLUE, etc.). I don't actually think it
changes with each game--I think it's always RRBBGR (R = red, B = blue, G
= green).

Now you just have to get the train moving. Remember how the other one
was stopped? Well, do those things in reverse. PUSH REGULATOR LEVER and
TURN BRAKE WHEEL.

If you read the plaque, it will give you a hint how you can escape the
demon: TURN DAMPER, twice.

Congratulations, you win!
Solution to "Groove Billygoat" by Efrain Finnell

This is the "quick and dirty" walkthrough that skips a lot of detail.
There is some randomness you may need to account for.
It is suggested you use the in-game hints (type HINT) before resorting
to the walkthrough.

First:
GO IN
GO OUT
WAIT (for about 15 turns or fiddle with your inventory)

The Orphans will escape and Betsy will start singing you a song. Wait
till she's done or drop her to end it early.

Soon after that, the Thin Man will appear in the Bad Part of Town. Wait
for him to go in to the Badder Part of Town and follow him (GO IN).

The StepEasy will now be apparent. Say the password SHAMONE and you'll
get inside.

(This is determined by asking one of the orphans about JAMON which is
what you thought the Thin Man said.)

TAKE OFF COAT
GIVE COAT TO GIRL (You'll get a coatcheck marker.)
NORTHWEST
WEST
MOONWALK NORTH
PUT MARKER IN BEAM
TAKE DIFFERENT MARKER
NORTH
EAST
SOUTHEAST
GIVE MARKER TO GIRL (You'll get the Thin Man's left glove.)

To get to the northeast quadrant where the stairs up are, you must
dance. You need to start in the southwest corner of the warehouse by the
jukebox. You have to start at the beginning of the song. You can either
wait for the Thin Man to throw a coin in the jukebox, put the coin you
found in the trash can in the jukebox if you didn't give it to the bum,
or HIT JUKEBOX Fonzie-style to start the music. Each move must be typed
in order before it happens in the description Don't type in moves the
text says you do automatically as it speeds up toward the end.

PIROUETTE
KNEES IN
NOD NOD
HEELPIVOT
POINT POINT
HEADPOP

NORTHEAST

Now you can go UP to the rooftop (click click click!)
WEST
WEST
USE CPR ON ANNIE

Thugs will kidnap the orphans and attack the apartment.
You must defeat them randomly by using the Thin Man's dragon shouts.
WEAR GLOVE then

AAOW - will knock the thugs back and has a chance of disarming them, but
will not stop bullets or ninja stars.
HOO - will stop bullets, thrown ninja stars, and lunging thugs who
attack you physically when out of weapons.
EEHEE - will get rid of whatever is hanging in the air. 

Once you stop all four thugs:

1/ General hints

Before revealing the complete solution, I thought it may be helpful to
have some tips for those who are stuck and just want a gentle nudge in
the right direction.

The aim of the game is to collect 5 specific items and leave them in the
pub (hence the name, 'Five Artifacts Inn').
The five artifacts are well-known items from 'The Hitch Hikers Guide to
the Galaxy', so you can discount the items you find that are unique to
the game (such as the Alterian coin).
To check if an item is one of the 5 artifacts, drop it in the Inn and
type SCORE.  You get 20 points for each object, so your score level will
tell you whether you have got a correct item.
Some of the artifacts are useless, except for scoring purposes, but
others are needed to solve puzzles in the game.
To get the Vogon ship to fly, read the book of poetry in the Vogon
Navigation room (where the poetry is graffitti'd on the wall).
To get the 'Heart of Gold' to fly, drop the rusty old engine in the
control room and push the lever (As the sign says: Don't pull the
lever).
Get the babel fish before giving the Arkleseizure a drink.
Use the coin to buy the chocolate first - don't use it on the Nutrimat
until you have the chocolate.

appear.  Don't let your input get ahead of the events onscreen, or you
may find yourself blasted into space.  Secondly, the gun can overheat
after a certain number of turns, so it is important to switch it off

3/ Cosmic Capers

While browsing through the screenshots in James Burrow's excellent
'gamebase 64', I came across an adventure game called 'Cosmic Capers',
which can be found on the 'Blast from the Past' disks (Blast 97, menu
option 9).  As soon as I saw the first line ("Hi there, guys, I'm Bugsy,
your lovable computer companion."), I knew it was the same game -
especially since 'Bob Chappell' and 'Supersoft' appear in reverse video
on the screen.

If you play this game, you will see that it is exactly the same game as
HH-64.  The only differences are that the reference to Douglas Adams and
Pan Books has been removed, and all the objects and places have been
superficially renamed.  However, it is obvious by the names that the
Hitch Hikers Guide version came first:  all the Cosmic Capers names keep
the same kind of format (for want of a better term): the 'bowl of
petunias' becomes a 'vase of pansies', the 'Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of
Traal' becomes the 'Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo', and so on.  And it
is unlikely that Cosmic Capers was first with the idea of bad alien
poetry!

So, if you want to solve 'Cosmic Capers', just follow the walkthrough
and use the appropriate nouns (eg, 'SHOOT VERRUCAN rather than SHOOT
VOGON).

- - - - - - 
4/ Miscellaneous

I was stuck on this game for a very long time (somewhere between 13 - 14
years, in fact, but this included several years without a C64).  I
finally found the solution on a disk of adventure game solutions created
using the Vizawrite 64 word processor.  I loaded up "The Hitch Hikers"
file to test the disk, expecting it to be the solution for the Infocom
game, and was bowled over when it turned out to be a walkthrough for the
Supersoft title!  Being in an 80 column format (on a 40 column screen),
I had to take two screen dumps and then stick them together in order to
print the solution out.  When I got home, however, I found that the
walkthrough missed a number of steps - a fairly common problem when
people write solutions down as they play the game.  Having used the
solution to get past my sticking point, I managed to finish the game
with a bit of judicious mapping.  I must say that after having waited so
many years, the ending was quite a disappointment!

There is a Spectrum version of this game (HH-64), which states it is (c)
Estuary Software Products.  It does not say who the programmer was, or
what year it was made.  There is also no reference to whether ESP and
Supersoft are the same software house, or one version was licensed from
the other.  I have always wondered whether HH-64 was  truly a piece of
commercial software, or if the 'by kind permission' line was just a bit
of fun added to a 'tribute' game by some keen fan.  However, it is
strange to find a non-commercial game popping up on two separate
platforms (unless one was just a home-attempt on one platform at
reproducing the commercial version from another platform?).

A post was made on internet news in Nov-Dec 98 by a person who claimed
to have programmed an intro to the game.  They were looking for a copy
of the file as they couldn't find it anywhere on the internet.  Having
searched both comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm, I have not been able
to find a copy of this post either to reproduce it here or obtain the
posters e-mail address in order to get more information from them.
Possibly the question was posted on rec.arts.int-fiction.

Obviously HH-64 had to have been released before Infocom got the rights
to create a HHG game.  According to the 'Infocom Fact Sheet VIII:
Chronology' by Paul David Doherty, the Infocom HHG was released in
October 1984.  I have a note that I bought my copy of this game in
August 1985 (compiled 21st December 1984, if you're interested).  My
preliminary map for HH-64 appears before this entry in my map book, and
it is dated '1st May'.  Whether that is 1984 or 1985 I cannot tell.

No information on HH-64 can be found on the Adventure Games List
maintained by Hans Persson and kept on ftp.gmd.de at
if-archive/info/adventure-game-history.

General tips:

Best weapons:
cleaver (village, in store) strength 10
battleaxe (eastern forest, grass roof hut) strength 18
fire whip (mystic cave, held by golem) strength 22

Most wearables has no effect, but the armor and shield (village, paladin)
occasionally heal you, and the cloak (elf) occasionally increases your damage.

There are two NPCs who can help you in combat
Werewolf (in mansion)
Tursk (in caverns)

Eating the rations (village, tavern) will give you an extra 200 hp and refill
your food count.  Eating the food (village, small room) will give you
100 hp and refill your food count, and will reappear in the small room
afterwards.

Lecture Feature
An Interactive Fiction by Paul Equinox Collins

Note: A few puzzles require speaking with someone who will probably be moving
around. So if you need to "talk to" someone mobile, you may have to walk
around for a bit to find them, or if you're trying to do something sneaky you
may have to wait for them to leave the room before doing it. In these
situations, the next line will be a room to go to to reorient yourself on the
walkthrough.

There's a list of all the students you need to recruit at line 225.

Reflective Comments
--------------------
I quite liked this game and even though only the beginning currently exists, 
most of it is complete enough to be considered a short game.  I thought the
answering machine puzzle was a bit tricky because there was no description of a 
button on it and it must be assumed that it can be turned on and off somehow. 
The game would have benefited greatly if it was more polished. I really liked

Mindshadow (Activision) Solution.

   Part 1

 Let's get started. You awake on a deserted beach with a spectacular
view of the ocean. In fact, look at the ocean but but don't go in the
water. Go N, then enter the hut and take some straw. Examine the trash
can and take the candle. Well, you don't really need it. Exit the hut
then go E.
 Take a piece of steel from the dory, then go E again and take a vine.
Go W, W, S, and drop all but the vine. Go E, and you should be at the
edge of a cliff. Tie the vine to a rock then go Down. Enter the cave and
examine and search all, then take a rock from the ground. Dig in ground.
Take the map, then E, Up, W. Look at the map, then N.
 At this point, you might want to save the game. Go N, N, E, N, E, E, S,
S, E. Search the trunk and take the bottle, but don't drink it. Go W, W,
N, W, W, S, W, S, S, S. Drop the map, then take the piece of steel and
the shell. Listen to the shell. Type, "BANG ROCK WITH STEEL OVER STRAW
TO MAKE FIRE". Drop the rock and the piece of steel, then wait. When the
boat comes, offer the captain the bottle.

 MINDSHADOW
   Part 2

 You should now be on the pirate ship and the captain will have left you
alone to go exploring. Go N, W, and talk to the doctor. Go S, then fight
with the man. Go S again and take the meat cleaver. You can also eat the
fish if you like sashimi. Go N, N, E, S, S, S, W, then cut the chain
with the meat cleaver. Go E, N, N, E, E.

 You should now be in England. Go E, E, E, S, and search the sleeping
man. Take the hat and the money, then go N, W, W, S.  Give the man 5
pounds and take the pole. Go N, W, and get the debris with the pole.
Drop the pole, then take the newspaper.  Read it. Remember to remember.
Go E, N, and talk to the man. Give the man 5 pounds and remember the
password (it may vary with different disks). Go S, E, N, E. This is
another good spot to save the game.
 Talk to the woman, then give her the hat. Go E. Examine the drink, then
follow the man. Go S, W, then take the hat and look inside the hat.
Rather then leave a tip, you can kiss the woman. Go W, N, E, then type,
"CHANDRALT" or whatever the password is in your game. Give the man 200
pounds for your ticket then go W, S, S, W, N, N, and enter the airplane.
Remember to remember.
 You should now be in beautiful downtown Luxembourg. Go N, W, then BOOTH
11. Talk to the man. If that doesn't work, search the man. Take the note
and the ID card, then read both of them. Go E, E, N, N, W, Up, N. This
is another spot to save the game.

 MINDSHADOW
   Part 3

 Go W, then DUCK. Examine the room and take all. Read the parchment. Go
E, S, Down, E, S, and now we are going on a little nature hike. Go E, E,
E, S, and dig in the ground with the shell. Drop the shell, then take
the leaflet and read it. It sure does look like a bank account number.
 Go N, W, W, W, W, and talk to the woman. Type in the bank number then
open the box. Take the gun, then drop the box. Go E, N, W, Up, N, N, N,
N.
 This is it. Save the game again, then E. Shoot the man with the gun,
then take themessage and read it. Now, if you have remembered all the
names and found all the clues, you should regain your memory and solve
the game by using the THINK COMMAND.

 Type "THINK ARCMAN". "THINK BOB". "THINK MASTERS". "THINK JARED".
"THINK TYCOON". "THINK LUXEMBOURG". "THINK WILLIAM". At this point, a
new screen should appear with the entire story of your trials and
tribulations.
Moon-Shaped
A Fairy Tale Retold by Jason Ermer

Annotated Walkthrough for Release 2


This document gives the full list of commands needed to complete Release
2 of Moon-Shaped. The walkthrough was written so that users can see "the
full story", but it is efficient in its approach and so won't lead to
the most rewarding gaming experience.

In addition, different adventurers will find different pathways through
the game; this document describes only one possible path. Annotations
have therefore been provided to make it clear what's happening so that
those who have progressed to a certain point via a different path can
get their bearings.

Comments on this document (as well as on the game itself) are welcome:
jasonermer -at- gmail -dot- com.


We play Rosalind Wechsler, age 13. It's Rosalind's birthday, but her
mother is distraught and either hasn't remembered or isn't paying
attention to her. So, Rosalind decides to visit her grandmother who
lives in the forest. To prepare for the journey, we'll need all of
grandmother's supplies (everything that's on the table: the wine, the
bread, and the jar of honey), plus our red cape:

> take everything from the table
> open the chest
> take the cape
> wear the cape

Before we go, though, some insight to the story can be gained from
trying to talk to Rosalind's mother:

> north

Then, it's out the door and on to grandmother's house:

> out
> south
> southwest

Upon entering the woods, we meet a wolf (press any key to advance
through the cut scene). He leads us somewhat astray, but Rosalind is
becoming a resourceful young woman, and we soon finds our way back to
the path:

> (any compass direction)
> (any compass direction)
> (any compass direction)

This puts us at the covered bridge and the edge of the Black Forest. Now
that we've reached the forest, many options are possible. For the
pursposes of this walkthrough, we'll go first to grandmother's house (to
retreive her locket). It isn't far:

> north
> northwest
> north
> north

Something seems amiss here in grandmother's living room, and having a
good look around may be in order. We're after the locket, which is up in
the attic crawlspace, which we can access via the kitchen:

> west

Before going up the the attic, note the cellar door:

> open the cellar door

(More on that later.) In the meantime, let's proceed to the attic:

> up
> examine the glint
> take the locket
> wear the locket

Now that we have grandmother's locket, other important parts of the game
will become available. There's one challenge though:

> open the locket

The locket won't cooperate with this, at least not yet. A hint about
this can be found by stepping out into the woods and trying again:

> down
> east
> south
> open the locket

To open the locket, we need to get out from under the canopy of the
forest (and into the center of the lake):

> south
> east
> east

To properly get out from under the canopy, we'll need to get into the
center of the lake, by boat:

> pull the chain
> enter the boat

Under the unfiltered moonlight, we can:

> open the locket

This action activates the magical powers of the locket, prompting a
variety of visions and remembrances throughout the rest of the game. To
get back in to shore, we:

> pull the chain

There were some parts of grandmother's house left unexplored, so let's
return there (to collect the walking stick and the monocle, among other
things). On the way we'll make a detour so that we can have some light
in the basement. To make all this possible, we'll need to re-purpose the
jar of honey.

> open the jar
> wash the jar

Then, we'll make ourselves a lantern:

> west
> catch some fireflies

Now back to grandmother's house for some snooping around her side yard.

> west
> north (*this action will trigger a vision)
> west

In the side yard, there's grandmother's woodpile and the hatchet she
uses to trim her firewood.

> take the hatchet
> examine the woodpile

Someone's been digging through the woodpile. Perhaps you should as well:

> search the woodpile

You find an unusual log, which bears a closer look:

> examine the log (* this action will trigger a vision)

The other major attraction in the side yard is the old well:

> examine the well
> examine the bucket

Recall that the cellar door was locked. This is out alternative route
underground, where we find some important items, and return to the
kitchen:

> enter the bucket
> take the key
> north
> take the glass fragment
> examine it (*)
> east
> east [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNLOCKING]

Now let's return to the living room (to collect the gloves and the
pebbles):

> east
> examine the quilt
> take it
> look

Disturbing the quilt uncovers the gloves, which will come in handy later
(the quilt itself is unnecessary).

> drop the quilt
> take the gloves
> examine them

The other important item here is the grandfather clock:

> examine the clock
> open it

To open the clock, recall a specific detail from the vision:

> concentrate on the locket (*)
> set the time to 2:35

Inside the clock, we find a boy's hunting jacket. The jacket itself is
less important than the contents of its pockets:

> search jacket
> examine the pebbles
> south
> examine the pebbles (*)

Moon-Shaped is clearly based on the Grimm Brothers' tale of Little Red
Riding Hood... but it may be at this point that another tale begins to
come to mind (if it hasn't already). Anyhow, those pebbles sure are
shiny -- just watch:

> out

Now that we've begun to notice them, we can spot those shiny pebbles in
places we hadn't noticed before! They form a path which we can follow
(to visit the burned ground and collect the candies):

> southeast (*)
> east
> northeast
> northwest
> northeast (*)

This creepy patch of burned ground has past significance (which is
revealed explicitly if the old woman's monocle has already been
discovered):

> look
> concentrate on the monocle (*)

When the old woman wore the monocle, she moved as though was was
avoiding "invisible obstacles". Wearing the monocle will grant us a
similar ability:

> wear the monocle

Uh-oh. The orange candies inside the cage are mesmerizing. If we try a
couple of different things while we're transfixed, a few hints will be
revealed about how to free us from the candy's spell:

> blink
> eat the bread

Now, let's try that again:

> wear monocle
> examine the cage
> take the candies

We can't reach the candies, at least not with our arms:

> push the candies with the walking stick
> take candies
> examine them (*)

The pieces are coming together, but there's one area that we haven't
explored completely yet. We'll go there to collect the dagger, crush the
candies, and learn the details of the curse (which will kick off the
endgame):

> remove the monocle
> southwest
> west
> north (*)

The cave entrance is blocked:

> north

But the vision we saw upon arriving indicates that the walking stick
will be helpful:

> swing the walking stick
> north
> down

There are several things of note in the cavern. First the inscriptions,
which are un-readable without the aid of the monocle:

> examine the inscriptions
> wear the monocle
> examine the inscriptions
> remove the monocle

Once we have taken the candies and read the inscriptions, things can
progress rapidly towards the endgame. A few final visions will "barge
in" during the next few rounds. The first of these visions gives a hint
about where to go next (the waterfall).

But first: note that the inscriptions mention a bit about "sweet
temptation" and show an image of snow or powder sprinking down onto a
skull. To make some sweet powder, we'll use the mortar and pestle here:

> take the pestle
> put the candies into the mortar
> crush them with the pestle
> take the powder
> put the pestle into the mortar

Also note the tin box:

> open the box
> take the dagger

Ouch! The silver allergy was also mentioned in the inscriptions, but
don't worry. We're prepared:

> wear the gloves

Although you might have to do some inventory management, depending on
what's in your hands at the time (the walking stick, for example, is
dirty and would ruin grandmother's gloves). Once you're wearing the
gloves, you can:

> take the dagger

Then, it's off the the waterfall (and the endgame):

> up
> south
> south
> southwest
> southwest
> down (*)

If you had visited the bottom of the waterfall before, it was a dead
end. However, by this point you're more attuned to your surroundings.
Note: from here, there will be no turning back -- this would be a good
time to save the game!

> north

There are two graves in this clearing (one for Rosalind's uncle Hansel
and one for her brother Rainer), along with the wolf (her father) with
grandmother (who was swallowed whole) in his belly. According the the
inscriptions, we're in search of the bones of the first cursed person in
the family to die. That's uncle Hansel, and to access his bones:

> open the wooden grave


From here, there are eight final outcomes possible. The endings have
varying levels of "success" depending on whether you and your family
members survive the next few rounds and whether you're able to lift the
curse. There are several actions that can be undertaken in a variety of
combinations:

-- Attacking the wolf with the hatchet will free grandmother from the
wolf's belly without killing him.

-- Attacking the wolf with the silver dagger will kill him (and
grandmother, too, if she's still trapped in his belly).

-- Sprinkling the powder onto Uncle Hansel's bones will lift the curse
and turn the wolf back into your father. (This action will kill
grandmother if she's in the wolf's belly at the time.)

-- Going south will be considered an attempt to run away. (You'll be
given two opportunities to reconsider because this choice will always
end badly.)

Here are the eight combinations that will end the game:

--- Ending #1 ---
This is the best possible ending, in which Rosalind, grandmother, and
father all survive and are free from the curse.

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #2 ---
Rosalind and grandmother survive and are free from the curse, but the
wolf (your father) dies:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #3 ---
Rosalind and father survive and are free from the curse, but grandmother
dies:

> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #4 ---
Rosalind survives and is free from the curse, but father and grandmother
both die:

> attack wolf with the silver dagger
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #5 ---
Rosalind and grandmother survive but remain cursed. The wolf (your
father) dies:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #6 ---
Rosalind survives but remains cursed. Grandmother and the wolf both die:

> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #7 ---
Rosalind dies. Grandmother survives, but remains cursed:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #8 ---
Rosalind and grandmother both die. The wolf survives but remains cursed:

> south
> south
> south

(At least skim through the StreamDiver Manual, and read the mission description and the mission report.)

(Now, one last thing. If you're using the advanced interface, I suggest typing SCAN. Now the left-hand window pane will list all scannable items every time you walk into a room. You'll see the necessity of scanning later, and it's incredibly useful to have a list of scannable items for each room you enter.)

(Also, another note. I didn't have the translate chip on during most of my playthrough, but as far as I know there is no disadvantage to always having that chip on. So type TRANSLATE now if you want.)

This is no tragedy, as you can always talk to Joxley and arrange to come back here, but it's worth keeping in mind. Also note that using your shield or cloak chips will use up your temporal capacitor charge a lot faster.)

               Sing1  Sing2  Sing3

    Amplitude  49     195    212
    Frequency  60-80  70-90  off the charts
    Phase      [*]    [*]    74
    [*] 180 degrees out of phase with each other.

(Your time-traveling nemesis stabilized Singularity 1 and took it with him. And since he didn't change the dials afterward, the dials represent the correct values for stabilizing Singularity 1. That is, amplitude=44, freqency=77, phase=223.)

(Putting all this information together, I predicted that Singularity 2 would have an amplitude of 190 to 195, a frequency of 70 to 90, and a phase of 43. This range does indeed hold the correct value.)

(My first guess was amp=190, freq=87, phase=43. This was not correct. And unfortunately, when you are close but not quite right, the game gives you no hint of this. As far as I know, all you can do is use a lot of trial and error, or get the help of somebody who's solved the game before.)

(If the power conditioner's initial setting of 55 is 10% over normal, then normal must be 50. And if the damage threshold is at least 50% over normal, then the damage threshold must be at least 75.)

(This is a nuclear weapon stolen from the submarine SSN Lansing. It has been set to do a secondary explosion if moved.)

(We need to deactivate this setting.)

(If you look in your documents, you'll see the thermonuclear activation reference. This is the info from the "stiff leather folder" in the submarine control suite. It says that you can interact with this weapon by typing an 8-digit code consisting of a 5-digit security code, a 1-digit weapon ID number, and a 2-digit function code.)

(That same reference, as you can see, also gives a very extensive listing of function codes.)

(You'll also need to look at the "launch codes" document (from that small leather folder from that dead guy's briefcase in the submarine). It says there are two launch codes, depending on which type of weapon.)

(Furthermore, you're going to need to guess the weapon ID number. When you interfaced with the submarine computer, did you note any information that might assist in making this guess?)

(Finally, it is helpful, though not essential, to have noted some information you get when you examine the missiles in the submarine.)

(The missile is #6.)

(Therefore, according to what it says when you examine the missiles, it is Weapon Class B.)

(Therefore, based on the launch codes, you should use the code 17015.)

(Finally, the proper function code to deactivate the security setting is 19.)

(And we now have a nuclear weapon, which, unlike the missiles just south of here, is small enough to be brought inside the sphere.)

(Furthermore, the conceit is that if you set off a nuclear weapon within the sphere, the temporal shield will prevent damage to everything outside of it, even as it itself is destroyed.)

(So our job here is to detonate the nuclear weapon. Forget everything you learned playing Trinity; violence is the answer to this one.)

Walkthrough for Necrotic Drift

So, we're in New Haz again, on a different outing. How different? It's a
bit like comparing The World's End to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in
the Blood and Ice-cream Trilogy: Necrotic Drift's setting and focus are
more linear and narrow than Fallacy of Dawn, but with a darker, more
mature plot and characters. I may make another reference to these films
later, but I'll keep it to one.

Chapter One: Duffy
Our intro is to a nice guy named Duffy, his love of D&D and one of the
few times he and his dad were best friends as well as family. Today
however, he's rolling his Dodge stat against video rental fees by going
to Academy Videos in New Haz so he can have a movie night with his
on/off girlfriend Audrey. Trying to prove a point about The Lord of the
Rings can lead to danger, it seems.
You don't 'need' to talk to Gibs or your room-mates in this number-based
dialogue system, but there's a nice bit of flavor.
Gibs is your best mate and chatting to him goes a little bit more into
your problems with Audrey (any number), and why your room-mates should
not be around if you want a movie night with her (if you picked 3).
Talking to him again after he mentions his plans for tonight offers some
foreshadowing.
Talking to both of your room-mates gives you an idea of why they
probably shouldn't be your room-mates.
X Clerk if you like- Adrian Bates hasn't changed a bit, not even his
profile photo. 
X DVDs. You can also X the genres to get an idea of Duffy's personal
taste.
Take DVD- no need to specify as Duffy automatically takes The Lord of
the Rings. 
You can also TAKE NAIL GUN when the clerk tells all of you to hurry up
for sleazy reasons, as he places it on the counter. He doesn't notice
you nicking it, so it looks like he really wants that massage...
Soon enough it begins. Some creature lurks its way into the store. The
clerk thinks it's a tramp and shows his caring attitude from the last
game. Everyone else thinks it's a bot, but bots other than Failed Romero
normally don't attack people- not even rude video store staff.
I normally ATTACK THING and save the clerk, but as long as you deal with
it before it starts on you. In fact, if you let it knock the clerk out,
Gibs encourages you to go get the nail-gun- which you may not have
noticed before because you weren't reading closely enough (oops).
So, no need to pay to hire LOtR. Let's go home. E.

You can X your car all you want, you can't realise that the bot's
climbed into your car until you try to 'enter car'. Cheeky bastard knows
to hide on the car floor.
Attack thing again until it drops.
Enter car.
Drive.

Chapter Two: Audrey
Onto your date with Audrey! In your living room, with two troublesome
housemates...This is definitely the part that reminded me a little of
Shaun of the Dead, so this is a problem that many people are having
today, especially since many people can't move out. This chapter is
fairly dialogue-driven, and your choices matter more in the banter you
read next. You can skip to the next chapter in this walkthrough if you
like.
The Duffster shares the story of his one big win that lead to his car, a
less limited wardrobe and his relationship: a D&D tournament that was
won through being a skilled and kind player...five years ago.
 
T Pang. Unfortunately, no matter which number you pick he won't bugger
off. When you hear the knock on the door, OPEN DOOR to let Audrey in.
You can talk to your housemates as they argue over what DVD they're
watching, but you can't change how they behave.
You can give your housemates a serve for ruining your date and being
rude to your girlfriend. T Pang, T Criswell in that order if you want to
do both.
N to go to your room and face the music. 
T Audrey.
Rather than her talk being a generic bitch about your housemates and a
nasty screech blaming you for it, Audrey is concerned about you. She
believes you deserve and can make a happier life for yourself, and that
you two are falling into a rut instead of enjoying life. Looks like
she's grown from once dumping Duffy for someone trying to buy his
funeral plot early- then dumping him for failing. You don't have to
agree, but repeat T Audrey and choose numbers to keep the conversation
going. 
She's also moving to Texas and wants you there with her, but you're not
keen on it. When you tell her this, she's a bit miffed and begins trying
to convince you.
Your only option is to say you have work. Not exactly a lie, but you'll
be starting early. Audrey agrees to talk more about Texas later and you
leave on uneasy-but-happy terms. 
S to get ready to leave.
You have nothing to say to anyone now. Let's go to work. OUT.

Chapter 3: Corporate Fret
Talk to Trott, read the postcard to learn a little about Delarion Yar's
happy ending.
Talk to Gibbs when he arrives, and do the same for Audrey when she shows
up.
Audrey wants to talk to you, but the request is more mundane: can you
help her friends working at the Bead Store with their register computer?
Try talking to the girls as they set up their ill-advised ritual. X
register. A cable appears to be causing the problem for the PC. Ooh, a
pretty crystal ball holder. Take Holder.
Take cable. 
To get back to it more quickly, STAND UP. Everyone is fine, Casey even
seems a bit too happy that the lights have blown. Sydney may need help.
X her...
And that's not Sydney. The Not-Sydney has weird demon eyes, is floating
and has now summoned a...

Skeleton: Duffy knows that skeletons, if they are like role-playing
skeletons, are vulnerable to blunt force. Where's a good bludgeon...the
crystal ball holder. Attack with holder!
Unfortunately, Duffy's afterthoughts inspire the Not-Sydney demon to
play with the funny little monsters and rules of D&D. At least they're
well-known, right?

Chapter Four: Necrotic Progression
After the crickets stop, Gibbs pulls everyone out of the store with
plans to escape the mall, which is now in lock-down. You, as Duffy, have
now been entrusted with being the group tank.

The only other person we care about in the mall is Trott (and even if we
don't care, he knows how to open the doors) so let's go find him. You
might as well drop that holder, as it's broken.

With Trott being as smart as he is, he would have gone to security to
find a way to lock out monsters or find weapons. We have to make sure
he's okay either way. Go east twice and then south to get back to your
store. Pick up the stool if you want to use another blunt object. E to
back office, x handprint on the window. X shelves, then LOOK IN
cardboard box to get the Sierra Hobbies Gamer Glove. N to move on from
dumping ground to lounge. Open the door to get into the security room
antechamber. 
Trott must not have heard us. The doors may be kept shut for a reason.
Maybe we haven't checked everything yet...Damn.

Zombie: Gibs makes a good start on attacking the zombie but his lacrosse
stick is knocked away and you have to save him lest you get two zombies
on your neck. TAKE STICK and do not let it go. You will need this more
often. 
Attack zombie with stick!
Talk to Gibs to see if he is okay and to cheer him up with the story of
losing your virginity...on 9/11.
Trott is actually quite well and will not turn into a zombie soon, one
of the few benefits of being a chubby nerd. He will open doors if you
ask him nicely. He offers to open the Sports Store door now, but I
prefer the 'later' option as the girls are just outside and have no
weapons. When he gives you the switched-on phone, just talk to Trott
when you're back at the sporting goods store.

However, there may be a few potential improvised weapons in the sport
shop, even if it's just a door knob in a sock. I like taking this moment
to talk to Casey, especially about boyfriends, caps and Audrey being
happiest with you. However, get in that store when the screams start!

Ghoul: X ghoul. Gibs is brave enough to draw attention away from Audrey,
but becomes paralysed due to direct contact with it. If you haven't
already, get those socks from outside the shop. Wear socks (as mittens
so they protect your hands). Attack!

Audrey takes you to see if an exit can be found, leaving Casey to look
after Gibs. What she finds instead is a suspected wraith at the perfume
counter and pulls you into the jewelry store to hide.

This part was a bit tricky.
Talk to Audrey as the vision unfolds. Empty pleather purse, and take the
silver comb that drops. Wraiths don't like silver.
When you first notice Audrey's shadow acting strangely, attack shadow
with comb. Shadows also hate silver and we don't want it hurting Audrey.
It will crumble and Duffy will entertain the risky idea of getting the
wraith inside to lower the temperature so the safe will open and get rid
of the wraith.
Yell to bring the wraith over. Now it's a waiting game. Watch
As soon as that sleazy bastard makes the safe lock open, open safe, take
silver rings and then throw those rings at the wraith. It will now turn
to dust and it is safe to leave.

The make-up kiosk is broken, but there is a bottle of perfume to be
salvaged. Not a gift for Audrey though. Throw that bottle of perfume
over the railing to get rid of that horrible smell. 
IN to enter elevator. Press 'Down'. Press 'Open Doors'. 
West.
Ghast: This guy hates cleanliness more than a sharehouse slacker. Take
water from the fountain. Throw water from the fountain at it. Even you
feel sorry for the hopeless sap.

For fun, go north, the display case at the Sunglass Hut and grab those
shades.
Lips in Poster Store: Be polite, there's no need to tempt fate. Listen
carefully to directions out and turn the flip rack to see the posters,
some even relevant to your quest. Remember the candles, text and water.
Spectre: Be nice. We'll need him later. Never tempt the non-immediately
hostile creatures.

You can't help the poor dead girl crucified in the cheap paperback
bookstore, but the text by her will be helpful. Take text. If you read
pink text with messed-up capitalization and accusations of being screwed
up, you are taking the right things to banish Not-Sydney.

Revenant in Candle Shop: Be nice. Tell him his murderer was the
Not-Sydney if you like. Talk to Audrey during the vision. Take menorah.
Take the urn from the crappy party favors store. Go back to the
fountain. Take water. Put water into urn.

Get back to the west side where Gibs and Casey were digging up rubble
for the way out until a vampire lady stole her. We can still save Casey
but we need protection in the form of garlic and to handle that
poltergeist throwing stuff at us.
Poltergeist: Drop all items at health store. W. Take all. E. Drop all.
Repeat this until there is nothing there to play with. 

At the Health store, search shelf. Take ointment. You will most likely
need this shortly. Move down, move further into the coffin room, then
into the alcove and take the garlic from the trestle. Immediately, you
have triggered the mummy, possibly Guardian of the Garlic? 
Mummy: This guy's strong, fast and poisonous for being dead for so long,
so you can't take too many hits and running away will only mean you get
hit in the back. It can be infuriatingly funny if you make a dash back
to the shop during the fight because Gibs will warn that the mummy's
behind you just as the last hit and poison is killing you. 

So...
Back to coffin room. South to go out. (Listen for the bang as the mummy
hits the bracket). North to go in again. Throw stick at bracket. The
torch will fall and burn the mummy to a crisp. Take stick.
If you're touched from the hits: Open jar. Take salve. 'Put salve on me'
to cure mummy ichor.

Search the coffin. You will find a blood bag amongst the dried blood.
Always good to have some of the universal type lying around, so take it.
Get back to near the fountain. The spectre is friendly enough, despite
his chilly exterior. He's happy to hold onto the blood for you and keep
it in good nick.

W.
Vampire: We have our garlic now. Attack with stick to eventually stake
heart. 

Let's go NW to get out of here. Not-Sydney is back now, but we have the
tools to banish the demon.
Follow Audrey's cue to read the text.
As far as drinking the water goes, we need a virgin. Who is a virgin?
Well, not our main characters and Trott's too far away anyway. Ah, the
head of the ghast you felt sorry for as you defeated it! No one would
touch someone that awful.
Pour water into the head.

You need to light a candle to finish the banishing ritual. X menorah.
Note white candle. Trott will appear and give you a lighter.
Light white candle with lighter.
Now the demon is defeated and cowed as you explain that your friends
that allegedly slowed you down are the ones who helped you get there,
and that the tabletop games fundamentally teach you about working
together, using your strengths to assist others' weaknesses and
protecting them so that they can repay you.
Sydney is now safe. Casey is not out of the woods yet, but the main
danger is gone. 
Gibs will be telling you of the time you have left to save Casey. The
vampire curse may be gone, but so is a lot of her blood. 
N.

Because you gave the blood bag to the spectre, he will now appear and
give it back. Audrey, being a good medical student, can now start the
transfusion to save her and you immediately know the video store is a
good isolated, dark place for a makeshift surgery. With the help of your
friends, your grit and a lot of D&D knowledge, you have saved a life and
may have kicked smoking. However...


Epilogue
Story time. Four months later, Benji's turned the arcade into something
more like a junk store. With Dance Dance Revolution knock-offs and
vomiting dolls. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Everyone has pretended the incident never happened. Casey has severed
all contact from you. Audrey moved to Texas anyway, leaving you behind.
This portion is conversation dependent, so talk a bit to Trott. It turns
out we couldn't have used him at the end and he's convinced there are
several mundane explanations for that night.
Attack the reappearing bot before it attacks you. Gibs will become a big
damn hero and find a practical use for a stripper pole. He's finally
ready to talk a bit about that night if you choose (and you finally get
a thank-you and bro-hug) or you can ask about new job opportunities.
Either way, keep talking to Gibs and Duffy will finally get the penny
that dropped for us ages ago, make the hardest phone call of his life
and take Gibs up on a long-standing offer. This will be the first night
for the rest of his life...

For anyone who's really cut up about the ending:
Yes, there's a lot of sadness in it all, but the final moment here is
Duffy's personal turning point. I think it makes sense: while main
characters often have their 'Eureka!' or personal problems solved during
the intense conflict, and Duffy did have his realization to what his
only real hobby was truly about, he was trying to help himself and his
friends survive the night rather than trying for a crowning moment of
awesome. The fact that no one ever wants to talk about it and face up to
nearly dying doesn't help his self-image either. It's only after he
chooses to take a real opportunity to start something better in his life
that he becomes a hero.

also included some hints for future TADS programmers which may or may
not come in handy. I apologize ahead of time for any unhandy hints.

Cody Sandifer (sandifer@crmse.sdsu.edu)



THE SOLUTION:

In general, studies in museums have shown that people are more likely to
turn right than left, so the order of the solutions might be backwards.
No, I am not kidding about the studies.

The "endgame" puzzles are two or three pages down the line.



You can't find your way across the puddle in the laundromat...

I suppose that you already tried to jump the darn thing. It won't work,
but it's fun to try anyway. I included mop as a verb only because a
playtester suggested it -- there isn't a mop anywhere. Perhaps you could
cover the puddle with something? The something would have to be large in
an absorbent kind of way, making the puddle safe to walk upon. It's on
the floor somewhere. In the pub. If you can't find a container, you
should do some serious searching -- especially in the tank area. You can
probably figure out the next step yourself. What kind of machine hangs
out in a laundromat? The date on the receptacle is a clue, albeit a lame
one. Put the dollar coin in the vertical slot. You're in the money!



You can't get the valuable rock in the rock museum...

Citizens of Chewton installed an alarm, but they're rather,
ahhh......stupid. The key isn't difficult to find once you take this
fact into account. I can't use invisiclues, so I'll just type in the
answer backwards: (.elbat eht rednu si yek ehT) Don't bother holding the
clue up to a mirror -- you'll just get confused. The letters are
forwards even though the words are backwards.



You can't get the bikers to leave the bar...

You could act on your violent desires, but that'll just get you
poetically smacked around. They seem to be intent on completing their
ritual -- remember the perfect note? I bet you could find one. If you're
looking for a tape recorder, don't bother. I decided that there was way
too much random noise to allow players to tape everything audible. Plus,
you'd probably get sick of hearing "Why would you want to tape that?" a
million times. Oh yeah -- the note is in a lofty place. Those choruses
really know their stuff. You haven't been to heaven, you say? Take a
good look at the pebbles on the tank. Then throw something at them --
but make sure you haven't stolen the smock first.



You can't get the mechanic to pay any attention to you...

Even with the hints I programmed into the game? Really? Kick 'em twice.
If you don't, your thoughts will nag you 50 turns later.



You can't find anything to give the mechanic...

Take a good look at the objects in the pub. Specifically, the (elbat
loop). Is this backwards thing annoying you? I hate reading clues before
I'm ready, so I figured that this is a fair compromise. If you're
dyslexic, I'm probably destroying whatever letter sense you've developed
through years of hard work. Sorry.



You can't get the money from the juggler's hat...

This one is pretty tough, actually. To get the cash, you'll need to
distract the juggler. If you haven't already thrown something at the
juggler, you should try it out. If you're still stuck, take a good look
at what she's juggling. The balls are round. Sound familiar?
Specifically, throw another round item at the juggler. If I haven't
screwed up, there's only one other round item in the game. It's the
(kcor elbaulav). If you *still* can't get it to work, it's because the
rock (darn, I just ruined it) doesn't look enough like the balls. What's
special about the balls? You got it: (egnaro er'yeht). You can turn the
rock (egnaro) by painting it twice. I'm not sure that this would work in
real life, which is why I added the bit about the paint "doing funny
things sometimes" if you ask the salesman about the paint.



You can't figure out what to do with the corn dogs...

Whatever you do, don't eat them. I left the obnoxious hunger daemon out
of the game. If you chow down, the game will be unwinnable. So, what to
do? As any good American will tell you, it's nice to have money. ($8
worth, in this game) I provided a heavy-handed hint in the description
of the cart. Try selling them. If that doesn't work, it's because you're
not dressed appropriately. Would you buy a corn dog from a weirdo on the
street? Even one as good-looking as you are? A salesperson should at
least *look* official. You'll need the smock in the uniform shop. The
corn dogs should be in the cart before you try selling them.



You can't find a way to get the smock...

Did you read the description carefully when you tried to get the smock?
(You'll never get the tailor's attention, so don't bother. Not even by
dancing.) There are a number of actions in the game that your conscience
won't allow you to do. This is one of them. Is there a way around your
conscience? Maybe if you (knurd tog).



You can't figure out what to do with the whiskey...

Try drinking the whiskey again. Be sure to read the reaction carefully.
(I really did try to hint at most of the solutions in the game.)
"Straight" implies that you might be able to drink the whiskey with
something else. A (ados) will do the trick, although you'll need money
to buy one first. Once you get drunk, try acting slightly immoral. You
know -- steal some stuff. At one point, I considered running a "guilt"
daemon late in the game to make the player feel bad. I never got around
to it, though.



You can't get the goddam (or goddamn, according to my progressive
spellchecker) apple without the old man checking out your action...

You can try to take, kick, and throw stuff at the apple. You can try to
hassle the old man. None of it will work. The only way to get rid of the
old man is to satisfy his craving. Buy him a little boy! (Just kidding.
The dirty old man isn't Michael Jackson.) You'll have to scrounge up 8
bucks first. Once you get the (nig), let him have it.



I've satisfied the mechanic's requirement.  What do I do now?

Did you tell him about the parade? He's in need of a good convincing. At
this point, you should be painfully aware of your (redneg). Use it to
your advantage. (It's probably too late to warn you, but I disallowed
[kcuf] as an option. Aside from 40 goddams and 20 hells, I decided to
keep the game relatively clean.)








HOW PARADE GOT ITSELF MADE


Before I start, I want to apologize if you find this overly
self-indulgent. Personally, I enjoy behind-the-scenes analyses of
movies, books, and other kinds of arty things. I thought others might
feel the same way, so I put my thoughts to paper. If anything else, I'll
be glad to have this record for whenever I get motivated to write
another game. Here goes!

After a long break, I got back into playing interactive fiction games
late in 1996. Flames of Perdition was a whole mess of fun, but I was
impressed that games such as Wedding and Uncle Zebulon's Will were
playable, entertaining, and (most importantly of all) SHORT! I didn't
want to spend an entire year on a game (or two, or three -- you know who
you are). I figured that I could bust out a game in three weeks. And --
you know what -- I *did* bust out a game in three weeks. Version 1,
anyway.

Before I began programming, I read the manual, drew a map, and penciled
in objects and puzzles. (Not that the outline was in its the final form,
mind you. Looking over my notes, I originally included a golf course at
the eastern end of the parade and a couple of additional puzzles: (1)
stealing money from an organ grinder monkey, and (2) escaping from the
van (initially) by popping a balloon with the lighter. In case you were
wondering, I got sick of programming and canned the extra puzzles.)

The introduction was the very first thing I wrote, which is probably why
it's so damn long. One playtester complained about its length, but I
decided to leave it as-is.

Up next was the daily typing ritual. Over Christmas break, I programmed
for three weeks straight -- sometimes, up to 10 hours/day. (I'm a
college student, which was how I found the time. I originally had four
or five college references in the game, although I've since deleted most
of them. There's probably some truth to the advice about "writing what
you know", but i-f games with collegiate themes bug the hell out of me.
Kissing the Buddha's Feet is a prominent exception.) 

As a TADS beginner, I spent most of the original 3 weeks figuring out
how to implement the puzzles in TADS. I averaged about a puzzle a day.
Although most experienced programmers advise against it, my working room
descriptions were short lists of objects and actors (you know, like the
old Scott Adams type of games). I wrote most of the room descriptions
the day before I shipped out Version 1 to playtesters. Since Parade was
a relatively small game, it worked out OK. I would advise against it for
larger games.


Here are some concerns I had early on:


Since Parade takes place in the real world (sorta), I had to restrict
the player's movement with something other than cave-ins and giant
Balrogs. That's how I thought of the train. Eventually, I walled the
player in with the parade itself. 


The whole money thing was a real pain. I'm just now learning how to
program indistinguishable objects, so an entire inventory of droppable
money (both coins *and* bills) was out of the question. That's how I
came up with an undroppable wad of cash that incremented only in whole
dollar amounts.

Due the lack of female leads in i-f, I knew from the start that I wanted
the player to be a woman. Also, I thought it would be tremendously funny
to provoke a gender re- evaluation halfway through the game.


Before initial playtesting:


Heaven and hell didn't exist. (If you didn't find hell, you can get
there by trying some of the "fun stuff" that I outlined.)

The bikers (arbitrarily, I now realize) left the pub after 4 visits.
This mystified most playtesters, since there was no sign of their
departure other than a brief "The table's free!" comment when the player
re-entered the pub. The apple could be found by searching the pool table
-- it had fallen into one of the pockets. Also, in contrast to the rest
of the characters, the bikers had no personality to speak of. "Rocks"
was how one playtester described them.

I didn't nudge the player with thoughts about getting the mechanic's
attention.


After initial playtesting:


I gave the bikers personalities and made it obvious when they left the
pub. After exiting a second time, the bikers pushed the player aside and
wandered into the crowd. To find the apple, you still had to search the
pool table.

I added a ton of inspectable objects, new verbs, and minor bug fixes.
Some major bug fixes, too. If you dropped the apple in the initial
version, you could never pick it back up. "But you already have the
apple!" Oops. Also, you could get the old man wasted with the gin
without ever trying to pick up the apple. Since the player has to be
aware of his/her sex before confronting the apple-munching mechanic,
this made the game impossible to win.

I still didn't include the nudging "thoughts" about getting the
mechanic's attention. As a result, some players (still) had no idea why
the hell getting the apple was so damn important. Since getting the
apple is the motivation for the whole plot, I thought it best to pound
the player with hints if s/he didn't smack the mechanic a few times. (In
retrospect, I now see the dangers in programming a highly linear game
where leaving a single puzzle unsolved can screw up everything.)

I wrote a bunch more atmospheric texts. (e.g. "The paint salesman rolls
his eyes.") Originally, there were 5-7 per noisy room. I ended up with
10-15 per room.


Somewhere around final playtesting:   (some modifications just before, 
some just after)


I included plurals. ("The clowns doesn't appear appetizing" really
started to annoy me.)

I changed the bikers into a puzzle. Getting them to leave was no longer
arbitrary. (At this point, the afterlife already existed -- but purely
for fun. Only those players who threw something at the tank could find
it. Finally, I realized that I could tie heaven to the bikers by giving
them musical tendencies.)

I made the apple fall to the floor. At first, I left the apple on the
table when the bikers left -- until someone pointed out that you don't
need to bend over to pick up an apple off the surface of a pool table.
So, I made the apple fall off the table and wedge itself. No complaints
about apples rolling on sawdust, please.

I modified the smock slightly. Many playtesters pointed out that wearing
the (originally tight) smock was a valid solution to the wedged apple
puzzle. I got around this by (1) making the smock loose and (2)
generating an appropriate message when the player goes for the apple
while wearing the smock. Unfair? Maybe so.

I added in a few other comedy bits (esp. the Giant Sack).

I downsized the Mound of Quartz room description. The original Mound of
Quartz room description included the information that now pops up when
you inspect the upper class. It was overwhelming (still is, maybe),
which is why I backgrounded the unnecessary detail. Also, I moved the
ATM machine from the Mound of Quartz to the Minimall Entrance to make
the Quartz room description more manageable.

Likewise, because I was unhappy with my writing, I erased or relocated
most of the original Uniform Shop room description. The wind, ghost, and
ominously looming objects are brand new. (Not even seen by the final
playtesters, actually. I bet that's how typos creep in.)

On one playtester's suggestion, I disallowed the use of "all" with
nearly every verb: all but 'get', 'put', 'take', and 'drop'. The
playtester had used "smell all" as a way to get a quick list of every
inspectable object. He had even solved the perfect note puzzle this way.
(Note, however, that the use of "examine all" allowed early playtesters
to figure out which items I accidentally omitted from room descriptions.
In Version 1, I had forgotten to include the bulletin board (Rock
Museum) and desk (Garage).)


Most playtesters still didn't like the late revelation of the player's
sex. (Which can come *really* late now that getting the bikers to leave
is a puzzle.) After wavering back and forth for a couple of weeks, I
decided not to give in to peer pressure. 

On the suggestion of playtesters, I added in a few more things for the
player to do when drunk (jumping over the puddle and reading the porno
mag, in particular).

I included standard TADS instructions (with a few minor changes to
interactions with characters) just because I could.

Hell was created for my own amusement.  Since there's a heaven, why not?


Changes for v2.2:

I corrected a major bug in the pub. Before the bug fix, TADS allowed
players to "show" every visible item. Thus, it was possible for the
offended biker to grind the bartender, the old man, and the pool table
beneath his boot. Man, that's one powerful boot. 

I made it easier to get to hell. Rather than solve the puzzles in a
particular order, the player can now get to hell by throwing an object
at the tank *after* stealing the smock. Jumping over the puddle while
drunk now transports the player to limbo. You can also get to limbo by
riding the train. Thanks to Admiral Jota for the smock-stealing
suggestion.

The player can now become a hobo by climbing on the train. I did this
mainly as a programming exercise to see if I could get the train to
start and stop like the elephant in Graham Nelson's "The Meteor, the
Stone, and the Tall Glass of Sherbet." (Sorry if I remembered the title
incorrectly.) Thanks to Stephen Granade for the train-hopping
suggestion.


Closing comments:

The playtesting and revising of games takes a *lot* of time. Version 1
(130k) came out in January. The first public version of Parade (Version
2.1 @ 264k) came out in March 1997. Before the final release, I must
have played my own game 30 damn times. At least.

Finally, writing this game was a lot of fun! Give it a try! To this end,
here are a few hints for those who want to give TADS a try. I highly
recommend it. (To help persuade you, keep in mind that, before TADS, my
last bout with programming was a beginning Pascal course in 1986.) 


TADS ADVICE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMERS:


If you think it'll help, I'd be glad to share code with anyone
interested in programming. Otherwise, here are some helpful hints for
hopeful programmers:


1. The Synonym and -> shortcuts save a lot of typing. Use 'em whenever
possible.

2. Programming doVerbPrep(actor,iobj) stuff is a real pain (as in "cover
puddle with sawdust", where "puddle" is the important object for the
verb). Redirect the ioVerbPrep action to the doVerbPrep like it says in
the Book of the Parser. Otherwise, the doVerbPrep never gets accessed.
(Can you say 2 wasted hours? I can.)

3. Take care of important details as you stumble across them. Don't wait
until later! For example, I programmed the responses to the improper use
of the paint machine (while the safety door was open, etc.) because I
knew that I would forget later on. Your playtesters will get cranky if
you don't anticipate these details. Speaking of which...

4. Use playtesters. They're nuts, but they're a big help. Like I said,
Version 1 was only 130k.

5. Use the plurals.t module on ftp.gmd.de if you want to incorporate
plurals. (Don't forget bugs.t, too!) This module may become pronouns.t
in the future.

6. Be sure that you don't modify a class property (the container class
verDoLookin property, e.g.) more than once. Unfortunately, the compiler
doesn't warn you when this happens; it just keeps the latest
modification.

7. In a related topic, be sure to check ADV.T before you modify a class
property. You might wipe out something important. (By the way, both
ADV.T and STD.T are worth a good look before you start.)

8. Unless you modify ADV.T, TADS allows players to "put" things that
they aren't carrying. This can lead to serious bugs if you forget to
block the "put" verb for inaccessible items (a wedged apple, for
instance). If you don't believe me, put the bush from Unnkulian I in the
bucket. Or, put the gold bar, anchor, or bookmark from Unnkulian II on
the went board. My solution was to forbid the player from "putting"
anything that he or she isn't carrying; Inform does the same thing. (I
should know, since I stole Inform's default "put" response.)

9. If you replace the default ldesc (long description) of a surface or
container object, any attempt to look in or search the container/surface
will call up the response "There's nothing on/in the surface/container."
Silly, I know. Bugs.t repairs this oversight.

10. If you want to trigger a daemon more than once, don't forget to
reset its counter to zero.

11. Watch James Cagney movies. Public Enemy, Strawberry Blonde, and
White Heat are good places to start.

12. If you replace one object with another (a live monkey with a dead
one, for example), don't forget to setit(new_object). This way, the
pronoun "it" will refer to the new object.

13. Create separate files (verbs.t, modifications.t, actors.t,
paint_shop.t, etc.) from the very beginning. This makes it *much* easier
to locate code for future revisions.

14. It's your own damn game. Do whatever the hell you want.

15. Read the manual and download lots of source code. If that doesn't
work, don't be afraid to look like an idiot on rec.arts.i-f. I'll be
glad to keep you company.

       Rakish Walkthrough
           By Anon

       (written with the invaluable
          aid of Nigel Downes)


Rakish is a TADS text adventure of an adult nature, written by Nigel Downes.
The introductory paragraph says it best, so here it is:

  In this adventure you take the role of a flirtatious and somewhat
  notorious english nobleman on holiday in France.  As well as all
  the typical Adventure commands (Take, Give, Examine, Look) you may
  well need some slightly less obvious instructions (especially those
  regarding the fairer sex...).  One other point to bear in mind,
  Gentlemen may Fence but they rarely simply Attack.  On with the show....


A few things not mentioned in this paragraph are two very important
commands.  The first is common in TADS games, which is "TALK TO X"
where X is a character name.  With this command, you can figure out
the game and complete it, but most likely not score above 50/100 points.

The second is a special command for this game, that being "SPANK X", where
X is again a character name.  With these two commands you should be able
to complete the game with a full score of 100 points...  However, if you
are stuck, a blatant walkthrough is listed below.

Also note that there is a bug in the game which allows you to amass a
score well above 100.  Giving anything to Alicia will increment your
score by +15 points (possibly dependent on TADS runtime version) while
only one particular item in the game should give you 15 points when
you give it to Alicia (don't worry, YOU'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT,
and it's in the walkthrough).

Full walkthrough for rematch.

REmatch, as you know, is a one move game.  If you and your friends survive this one 
turn, you will win. However, it takes exactly nine moves minimum to deduce the 
information needed for the winning move.  This walkthrough shows you alll nine 
moves.

1/1

>sw

You will see a guy get mad at his table number being called, and get ready to smash 
his cue stick into a control panel.  However, someone else will stop him, and tell 
him that it wasn't his table, which it wasn't. Write down the number of that table.

Nick and Ines get killed. You lose.  type "auto"

2/2

>s

You will see that one ceiling fan is very rickety, and right in front of the pane 
of glass where the SUV goes through. if someone could just make it fall, it would 
scare people away from the front, and save lives...

All three of you die. You lose. Game auto-restarts.

3/3
>se

Here you see a distracted cashier, who hears someone shouting a number, and then 
mistakenly calls to that table, saying that their time is up. This is why the 
person got mad earlier. If you could just get her to say the number from 
earlier...

Nick and Ines get killed again.... you know the drill.

4/4

>w

Here, you see the loudmouth, who shouts a movie name with a *number* in it. Funny 
enough, the cashier lady call *that number*.  

You know the drill.

5/5

> look in ines's knapsack.

You see a cellphone, some tennis balls, and a far-side calendar.  perhaps the 
calendar deserves a closer look.

You know the drill...

6/6

>look at farside calendar

Unlike most of them, this one has each day with it's own number, so it has all the 
numbers from 1 to 365 on it.  Aha!  This calendar has the number from earlier.  But 
now what?

7/7

>ask ines about loudmouth.

They talk about how annoying he is, and how she'd like to throw something at him.

By now, you should realise a few things.  Ines will do *anything* that Nick dares 
her to.  Trying to dare Ines yourself doesn't work. Nick must do it. But if you 
tell nick to do it, she'll hear. So you must whisper to nick to dare ines to...

8/8
>whisper to nick to dare ines to throw eight ball at loudmouth.

Well, just as they predicted he says the number on the ball. Aha!  So if you could 
get the calendar page to him, he'd probably make a remark like "Far Side Calendar 
page <XXX>, the best cartoon of all time?!?!?"  But those calendar pages are too 
flimsy to throw. You'd need to throw it with a ball. But he always says the number 
on the ball... what do you do?

9/9

>.whisper to nick to dare ines to throw cueball at loudmouth.

Right, the ball with no number on it!  This is what you will use to send the 
far side page!

About here you get told the Deja vu message.  This time, the table number you got 
from step one will be the one near the panel! So now, we know what to do to break 
the cycle.

10/1

> whisper to nick to dare ines to throw page <xxx> at loudmouth with cueball

If you were to try this on any other time in the cycle, it would fail, and you'd 
need a different number.  Congrats. this is probably the longest adventure game 
sentence you've EVER had to type to complete a game. :)
Walkthrough for Room 206 v.2
A Harrowing Reflection on Horror, Death, and Love by Byron Alexander Campbell

NOTE: this walkthrough applies to Version 2 of the ALAN release of Room 206.  The precise solutions may not apply to later or earlier versions, or releases in a different format.  Also note that this plot-driven tale relies on a precisely timed series of scenes or events to proceed.  There will be times (indicated with a 'z' for 'wait') when a certain number of turns, rather than a specific action, will be required for the next event to occur.  While you can spend those turns however you like, I highly recommend taking every opportunity to examine and interact with anything and everything in sight.  The person who simply does what needs to be done to "win" won't get nearly as much out of this story as the person who explores every nook and cranny of the Room and its surrounding spaces.

Room 206 is light on puzzles, and death should never occur, but there are a few times you'll be asked to perform action that might not be immediately apparent.  You might also hesitate when the way forward seems clear, but morally ambiguous.  This walkthrough should help with those moments.

(note: during this puzzle the mystery man will occasionally call in to provide hints, depending on your progress.  While these are intended to help solve the puzzle, they also expand the story in their own way; it may be worth waiting around to hear all four of them before you start the following actions)

(note: the seagull's actions are random, but basically you need to wait until it has thrown itself against the window enough times for it to shatter)

(note: in this section you have a choice that will help determine which ending you receive.  You can continue beating the man, even though he has stopped talking, or you can wait until the drapes rustle, allowing you to exit the room)

(note: here's another choice that will determine your ending.  "say guilty" or "say innocent," whichever you think is correct)
once the door is open:

(note: you're now in a pseudo-maze.  The solution is random; just go in the direction of the light.  If a direction doesn't work, use the synonym listed in the room description)

THE WEDDING WAS LIKE A DREAM...
On Saturday.
------------

This is a day for general stuff. To prepare the way. Very few
puzzles actually need doing today. Most of this stuff can be put
off.

Once you wake up from your dream. (cast the WOO spell and make a
move on the girl).

GET BOOK. D. NE. SIT. Once all is loaded on the carpet. the carpet
controls come on. TAKE OFF. Follow the directions in the DOX.TXT
file. Print that file up. It is very useful.

Once you get to Fort Naughtytail, you will have to push everything
off the carpet. Push the stuff off in whatever order you want. You
will find it all by the end on Monday anyway and the only things
you really need are the trunk and the lotion.

The game will carry you along until the confrontation with GLY.
Then cast the FRIMP spell on each barbell (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)
just before he tries to lift them. FRIMP takes time to recharge so
only cast when he is standing before each barbell.

Go to the souvenir shop. (There is a mapping function in the game
so I will not give specific directions to most places). Near the
Hotel. Buy the UPPSSY spell.

Open all spell boxes if you have the book with you, this writes the
spell in the book for multiple uses.

Then go to the Casino near the center of the village. Cast the
UPPSSY spell on the casino (UPPSSY CASINO), when you are outside.
This makes it no longer "crooked" both literally and figuratively.
Then save the game and go in and PLAY RUELOTTO. Bet on number 6
until you win or have bet six times. If you win go outside and save
the game. If you lose restore. Remember if you didn't cast the
UPPSSY spell you can never win in the casino. Get about 1800 or so
gold. This will be as much as you need for the whole game. It takes
patience but it is worth it in the long run.

Once you have 1800 gold. Buy the key from the rummy in the
groggery.

Buy the slimfish from the fish stand in the fish market.

Go to the mouth of the cave and get the haunch. Take it to the end
of the road (From mouth of cave S.S.SW.)

Drop the haunch. Tomorrow there will be a hole under the fence.

Get the gloves batman dropped at the cliff road. At the bottom of
the cliff you will find one of the things you pushed overboard.

Go to the open shops (Pawnshop, hardware store and souvenir) BUY
ALL in each store except the pawnshop. There BUY BOX,BOMB. OPEN
BOX.

Leave everything but the BOOK AND SHOVEL in the lobby. Go to the
seafood restaurant (the TOURIST TRAP). SIT. ORDER BISQUE. when the
bisque gets there EAT BISQUE. GET ALL. N. The sheriff will bust you
for the first of many times in the game. To get out of jail. DIG.

Go to the hotel lobby and GO TO ROOM 911. Wait until someone offers
to sell you a good ticket and BUY TICKET. When your turn comes go
in. OPEN SUITCASE. OPEN RATANT BOX.

Go to the lighthouse at the jetty end. UP. Get bulb. Get treatise.

Go to the fort. L IN CANNON. GET MOSS.

Go to the lobby. DROP ALL. If you followed all instructions (and
had enough time) then the following items should be there.

Go to the END OF THE ROAD. The dog has vanished as has the haunch.
go through the hole in the fence. (W).

Open the box. (SPUNJ SPELL)

Go west to enter maze game. One way of winning at the hard level

SLAP THAT FISH OVERFISHING GUIDE
by Michael Martin

GENERAL STRATEGY

Slap That Fish is a series of battles for the fate of yourself, your
honor, and all mankind, against legions of fish.  Although, as the
game progresses, you will begin to face enemies that are actually item
usage puzzles, the core of the game (and what your score is ultimately
based on) is a resource management puzzle; the general goal is to
trade stamina for damage as efficiently as possible.

BASIC ATTACKS

You have four basic attacks (ATTACK FISH will cue you with them):
PUNCH, KICK, SLAP, and BACKHAND.  If they connect, they generally
charge you two stamina and inflict two damage.  KICKs are more likely
to be evaded by smaller fish, and evaded kicks in particular will
generally only cost you a single stamina point.

COMBINATION ATTACKS

The cost of a basic attack can vary based on the last few moves you've
done; this will either deliver extra damage or cost you less stamina
to perform.  For example, against most enemies you can use the basic
"one-two": if you follow up a SLAP with a BACKHAND, the BACKHAND will
cost only 1 Stamina but inflict 3 damage.  Thus "slap/backhand" is a
combo that costs 3 and inflicts 5.

The difference in combat effectiveness is significant; against the
first opponent (the rainbow trout, who has no counters other than
immunity to kicks): with a sequence of nothing but slaps, you will
need to attack five times and expend 10 endurance to defeat him. As
you start with only five endurance, this works out to 10 turns of
battle and five attacks. However, if you instead use one-two combos,
you can inflict 10 damage in two iterations, and this means you only
need to rest for a single turn, between the two combinations.

Running out of stamina partway through a combo will interrupt the
combo and is always bad.

Different fish have different combinations against which they are
vulnerable. Pay attention to the text you get, as combinations in
progress usually have some special text that seem to indicate that a
move was unusually effective. This is worthwhile even if it looks like
there's been no extra damage or lesser stamina cost; sometimes
completing a combo will trigger a plot event or environmental effect
that will deal loads of damage.  If it looks like a combination hasn't
paid off, it's probable that you just haven't extended it far enough
yet.

Moves that do not finish a combination but are nevertheless part of
them may actually not do damage; replies to these often will mention
something about the fish becoming exposed or moving into a new
position that will suggest a followup.

OPTIMIZING YOUR SCORE

The scoring itself is based on, effectively, damage per second (DPS)
and damage per attack (DPA); it's computed based on how long it takes,
and how many attacks it took, to take down your foe. Because of the
combat and stamina regeneration model, however, optimizing damage per
endurance (DPE) - the most damage for the least stamina cost - will
usually optimize both, and so this is the statistic to focus on
primarily.

Some items will change the damage of your basic attacks; this may
change the total efficiency calculus if you have endurance to
burn. There is also a point in the game where you can get a full
stamina recharge, which will be necessary to get a perfect score in
its fight.

It is usually unnecessary to spend the between-fight times preparing
items for the next fight, but it also rarely hurts. When working for a
perfect run, save immediately after the ends of fights, not at the
beginnings of the next ones.

PER-FISH HINTS

Trout:        This is a practice fight. Get your combos going, and make
              every move count. If you can't perfect this guy, you may
              have trouble doing damage fast enough to the enemies
              that will actually fight back.

Bass:         Examining the situation and reacting appropriately will
              yield more damage faster than just attacking blindly.

Clownfish:    This enemy can be one-shotted. Think outside the box.

Catfish:      Just because a move has done no damage doesn't mean it's
              not part of a combo.

Tuna:         Long, repetitive combos can end with a sizable bang.

Swordfish:    Make your combos last as long as they possibly can. Also,
              do not run out of stamina while performing them or you
              may trigger a game-breaking bug in version 1.1.

Pufferfish:   You can't touch it directly. Keep the pressure on and
              don't let it close.

Shark:        This is a puzzle battle, but keep your combos in mind.

Electric Eel: Protection is available. You'll need to prepare in
              advance to overcome its defenses fast enough for a
              perfect score. Fortunately, you can rest as much as you
              want before he shows up.

Piranha:      Mix it up! You cannot safely do any move more than twice. The
              crowd's chant gives you key to a flawless victory, but
              you'll need to make sure your stamina is at least half
              full before you make the first move.

Anglerfish:   In defeating the piranha, you will have improved your
              basic attack damage. For once, combos are not the whole
              of the answer, even once the puzzles are solved.

Coelacanth:   To complete this battle as rapidly as possible, you will
              need to have satisfied your winning combination's
              preconditions in advance.

OPTIMUM COMBINATION VALUES

These are targets to shoot for for a maximum score. Some fights may
require you to prepare in advance during the inter-fight
sequences. Others may actually be beaten by careful use of preparation
or foreknowledge.

Trout: 5 turns, 4 attacks
Bass: 8 turns, 3 attacks 
Clownfish: 1 turn, 0 attacks
Catfish: 9 turns, 6 attacks
Tuna: 20 turns, 10 attacks
Swordfish: 22 turns, 11 attacks
Pufferfish: 16 turns, 6 attacks

Walkthrough for
SPECULATIVE FICTION
by Diane Christoforo and Thomas Mack
(This walkthrough is by us, that is. But we wrote the game too.)


RORY: Hi, everybody, and welcome to the annotated walkthrough for Speculative Fiction! Whether you're stuck in the game, or just curious to see if you missed anything, we hope this walkthrough will be a fun and educational experience! I'm Rory. I play W.D. in the game. 
MARTIN: And I'm Martin. I play the wizard. 
RORY: The wizard doesn't officially have a name, but we like to refer to him as Bill. 
MARTIN: I prefer Frederick, but we're never going to agree on this one. Anyway, let's get started. You begin the game in Not a---
RORY: Wait. We should explain how this works, first. This walkthrough is divided into a number of parts. 

In Part 1, we'll try to determine who we are, why we're here, and what our goals are. 

In Part 2, we'll do a general exploration of the game map, and pick up any freely-available objects. 

In Part 3, we'll solve the easier puzzles. These are pretty straightforward. You'll need to bring a few objects to the right location and combine them. 

In Part 4, we'll solve the harder puzzles. These puzzles have multiple stages, require timing, or both. 

In Part 5, we'll solve the endgame. Now, the endgame _is_ timed, but it's also pretty simple, so this bit shouldn't take too long. 

If we have time, in Part 6 we'll talk about interesting actions you may want to try, some of which will be hazardous to Bill's health, or to W.D.'s. I should mention that this walkthrough will strive to be pretty thorough - we'll mention actions a player might take even if they're not strictly necessary - examining objects and such. 

MARTIN: But then you'd miss out on all the behind-the-scenes gossip. 

PART 1: WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE

MARTIN: We begin the game in Not a Dungeon. Your first goal is to figure out what's going on. 

> x me

MARTIN: Ok, that's kind of a strange description. You get told that your body is unconscious, but you're giving commands to someone or something. 

Let's see what else is in the room. 

> x vase
> take vase

MARTIN: We'll need this vase eventually, so we're going to take it now. 
RORY: I really hate that vase. 
MARTIN: I know, but we need it for full points. 
RORY: Bleh. What else is in this room? 

> x tapestry
> x inscription

RORY: This is just flavor, but it lets you know a little bit about the backstory. Let's check out the body. 

> x body

RORY: That's the same description as "x me". So who's driving this thing? 

> look in mirror

RORY: And there I am! Aren't I awesome? 
MARTIN: As a side note, "x you" also describes W.D. Let's examine Frederick the wizard some more.

> x robe
> look in pockets
> take wand
> x wand

RORY: Yay! Magic items! 

> wake wizard  

MARTIN: Now you have some more idea what's going on. Your mind is inside W.D., giving him directions. 
The vase and the wand are the only objects you can get in the room, so it's time to escape. 

> x door
> open door

RORY: W.D. can't get through the door, because he's a bird. On the other hand, he's a bird. 

> x window
> fly out window

RORY: And with a big WOOOSH, W.D. is free. "d" doesn't work to get out of the room initially, but once you've escaped for the first time, you can use "u" and "d" to go between Not a Dungeon and Castle Gate. 
MARTIN: I have to say, this was probably the hardest scene in the game for me to film. You'd think lying there would be easy, but it's really hard to be still! At least Fred's only supposed to be unconscious, so I could still breathe. 
RORY: There was that one session where you kept laughing. 
MARTIN: You examined the tapestry thirty times in a row! Maybe Frederick was having a funny dream. 
RORY: Well, his brain is in W.D.'s bag, so I don't see how - 
MARTIN: *cough* Anyway, we eventually got the scene filmed. At this point, W.D. is in Castle Gate and ready to explore the game world proper. 
RORY: Unfortunately, W.D. cannot break down the doors of the castle, so the relevant thing to see here is the tree. 

> x tree
> climb tree

MARTIN: This brings us to the top of the tree. You can see a fair amount of the map from here. 

> x stall
> x castle
> x magic
> x farm

RORY: This area's here to give you a feel for the map. Note that when you examine the magic shop, W.D. says, "We should go there to ask for advice."
MARTIN: There's one other thing here. Don't forget the note. 
RORY: Right, right. 

> take note
> read note

RORY: So one of those pesky tree-climbing humans has left a treasure hunt for his girlfriend. We'll be following it later. 
MARTIN: Fun fact: the models of the other game locations which you can see here? Ken in costuming made them. He makes dollhouses as a hobby. He's working on a replica of the whole game world now. 
RORY: Wow. I didn't know that. Cool. 
MARTIN: Yeah, I learned a lot of neat things about the crew while waiting to film my scenes. 
RORY: I kind of regret not being able to hang out with people more, but I was on camera basically the whole time. Anyway, we should probably take a break from the shop talk. People are trying to win this thing. So! Mel will give us advice, so that's where we should head.

> n

MARTIN: Now we're at the south part of Big Street. Mel's is off of the center section. You'll notice there's a beggar here - 

> x beggar

RORY: But we're going to skip the beggar for now. At this point, it's not entirely clear what we're up to. We'll come back once we have a reason to bug this guy. 

> n

RORY: This is Big Street, Center. It is the greatest location in the game, because it contains Sandie's Hot Meats. Tragically, we need to skip it for now and go to Mel's. 

> e

MARTIN: The room description of the magic shop starts to explain what we're doing: "We're here to ask Mel for a Midas potion." 
RORY: Now, the very first action you take in the magic shop is going to be intercepted by a cut-scene, so we'll just look at the room again. 

> l 

RORY: And here's your plot dump. Now, that was a lot of text, so let me summarize:
   1.) Bill the wizard has been embezzling and just got caught. 
   2.) The treasurer has to go find the king to get Bill executed.
   3.) Bill needs to fill the treasury back up before that happens. 
   4.) If we get Mel lots and lots and lots of money, he will sell us the ingredients to make a potion that turns all the fake treasure in the treasury to gold.    
   5.) Profit.
MARTIN: I think that's the first time I've seen one of those lists where the item before "Profit" isn't "???". 
RORY: Well, it's, "Get Mel lots and lots of money", which might as well be "???"
MARTIN: I guess it wouldn't be a game if it were obvious. So, there are a lot of things going on in this location. First, Mel speaks Raven. He's the one NPC you can have real conversations with. 

> ask mel about money
> ask mel about wizard
> ask mel about wand
> ask mel about potion

RORY: Some of these are hints, and some are just flavor. If you haven't already tried waving the wand, you should do that. About half of the responses in "ask mel about money" actually correspond to things you can do in game. He also has opinions on many of the other NPCs. 
MARTIN: Including a backhanded compliment about poor Frederick. Sniff sniff. 
RORY: Also, this is where we'll come back to in order to cash in completed puzzles. It's also where we'll make the Midas potion. That will be later, though. 
MARTIN: There are also several items in the shop. The cockroaches are there to look cool. The trinkets we'll deal with later. We can take the balloon now. Then we'll head off to the southeast corner of the shop. 
RORY: Yeah - now that we know the plot, we're going to do a rapid-fire run through of the map, taking objects and looking for puzzle pointers. 

PART 2: RUN AROUND THE MAP AND TAKE STUFF

> take balloon
> se

RORY: The alchemy bench is full of items which aren't nailed down. We'll take all of them. 

> x dye
> take dye
> x clear
> take clear
> x book
> read book
> read page

MARTIN: There are three bottles of blue dye, but we're going to solve the puzzles in an order such that we only need one. You can come back here if you use up or destroy a bottle. (Or you can just take all three at once.) Also, we don't need the whole spellbook; just the relevant page. 
RORY: The solvent actually works, if you're wondering. The prop for the spellbook is now blank due to an accident with the "clear fluid". 
MARTIN: Rory carefully neglects to mention who caused the accident. 
RORY: HEY GUYS I SPILLED THE SOLVENT ON THE BOOK. ::cough:: 

> nw
> w
> s

MARTIN: We're back at Big Street, South. Let's check out the beggar in more detail. 

> x beggar
> x cup
> look in cup
> x strange
> take strange

RORY: Okay, so the beggar can hear us, but not see us. He's got some kind of rare coin, but we can't get it from him yet. 

> n
> x stall
> x sandie
> x pans
> excitement pan
> ask sandie about meat

MARTIN: Sandie can't speak Raven, but she does know who we are. There are a couple of NPCs who know that W.D. is a special raven and will treat him a little bit more like a person. 

> take salt

RORY: There's salt and pepper here. I'm cheating a bit in that I know we'll need the salt and won't need the pepper. But hey, that's why you're reading a walkthrough--- for the delicious cheating. There's infinite salt here, but you can only take one packet at a time. If you use it up, you can come back to Sandie's to get another packet. 
MARTIN: I need to interrupt for a minute and put a plug in for Alessandra, here. She plays Sandie, and she was an absolute _delight_ to work with. She's professional, she's funny ... if you are trying to write a female character in your game and you need someone, I really recommend her work. 
RORY: I have to second that. We tried to get her in here to help with the walkthrough, but she's got a gig as an evil sorceress in a dungeon crawl right now. 
MARTIN: The salt is the only thing we really need here for now, so it's off towards Moneyville.

> n

RORY: This area is _mostly_ a hub. There's one thing to check out:

> x cord
> pull cord

MARTIN: Well, that's exciting! We'll be back to deal with the cord in more detail later. Conveniently, we've been moved to the Bank Lobby. 

> x forms
> x poster
> x man
> take poster

MARTIN: All humans look kind of alike to W.D. 
RORY: Which is speciesism. 
MARTIN: Anyway, we can take the poster. It describes Two-Handed Bart, horrible bank robber. 
RORY: "Horrible" because he's bad at it. 
MARTIN: What? No, no, the fact that he robs banks is horrible ... er, moving on.

> e
> x teller
> ask teller about loan

RORY: The teller doesn't speak Raven. If we want to communicate with her, we'll need another way. 

> x chandelier

MARTIN: Here's the cord we saw outside the bank earlier.

> x cord

RORY: We'll see the cord in the guard tower too. It's the bank's alarm system. 

> break cord

RORY: But we can't do anything about it from here. 

> w
> n

MARTIN: This is the Stock Market. There's an auction going on.

> x auctioneer
> x coffer
> x merchants

RORY: There are also a lot of animals. 

> x animals
> animals, hi

RORY: Some of the animals are pretty nervous.
MARTIN: If you stick around for a few turns, you can watch the auctions going on. For now, there aren't any objects we can take. 

> sw 
> w

RORY: Mindo Street lets us get into the guard tower, and also has a cool statue. 
MARTIN: I hear the statue is actually modeled after the father of one of the writers, as a sort of cameo. 
RORY: Really? I heard it was the set designer's ex. 
MARTIN: Huh. Well, it's someone. 

> x statue
> x plaque

RORY: Cute. Time for the guard tower. 

> n
> x bell

MARTIN: Here's the last part of the alarm system. If you try to ring the bell from in here, you just annoy the guard. 

> x guard
> x mustache
> take mustache

RORY: Sound sleeper. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that's artistic license. I tried that thing on. It _hurts_. 

> x wastebasket
> take vellum
> read vellum
> x signature

RORY: Apparently Bill the Wizard was up to something other than just embezzling pre-game. 
MARTIN: This letter relates to a mysterious device which we'll see in a few turns.

> x tunic
> take key

RORY: I'm now going to show you the evidence cabinet and then walk you through two ways of not opening it. 

> x cabinet
> x crack
> look in crack

MARTIN: You can't examine the scrap and the device without opening the cabinet, which you can't do yet. 

> x lock
> break lock

RORY: That's Failure 1.

> unlock lock with key

RORY: And that's Failure 2. 

> give key to guard

MARTIN: Say it with me, folks: "We'll be back to deal with this later." We're giving the key back to the guard now because he's the only person who can open the cabinet. 

> up

RORY: Now we're at the barracks. We can finally take some more objects. 

> x blanket
> take blanket
> take bit

MARTIN: Mmm, a smelly blanket.

> x guard
> x forms
> x stamp

RORY: The signature is, in fact, the treasurer's.

> x guard
> x tunic
> take pouch
> open pouch
> take florin

RORY: They really don't hire the guards for their alertness, do they? 
MARTIN: The guy's been stamping paperwork for sixteen hours. 
RORY: I guess. As we learned with the guard downstairs, tunics contain exciting objects. This guard has ... A SINGLE FLORIN!!! Our first real money!
MARTIN: Don't try to turn the florin in to Mel, though. We'll need to turn one florin into many before we have anything worthwhile. 
RORY: Off to the last few game locations. 

> d
> s
> w

MARTIN: Ah, the sea.

> take rod
> x rod
> wave rod

RORY: The fishing wand generates a variety of forms of bait. 

> eat <bait>

RORY: We're going to eat the bait to get rid of it for now. Our props deparment failed to get us duplicates of some relevant items - there's only one "salt" and one "faery coin" and one "bait", so you won't be able to get another one until you dispose of the first one. 
MARTIN: Yeah, in an ironic twist, it turned out a certain someone was stealing from the props budget...
RORY: Legally, we can't mention her name, but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Also it rhymes with "Mendolyn". 

> x scarecrow

MARTIN: The end of that description is not a typo. 

> x hat
> take hat

RORY: For convenience, you can refer to it as a hat. 
MARTIN: So what's up with the circle and the barrel? 

> read sign
> x circle
> x barrel
> take fish
> enter circle
> take fish
> eat fish

RORY: I would like to point out that I am claustrophobic and this was not fun to film. I'm going to go get some air. Martin, you deal with this bit. 
MARTIN: Ok. So W.D. is trapped in a magical cage. 

> x cage
> open cage
> e
> z
> z
> z

MARTIN: It doesn't open on its own. (We filmed a scene where if you waited for twenty turns, a fisherman would come and throw you into the ocean. That got cut for being too gruesome.) Violence turns out to be the solution to this one. 

> break cage
> break cage
> break cage

MARTIN: W.D. can break out in 1 to 3 turns, so you may have to try multiple times. Now we have a treacherous source of fish. 

> exit circle
> e
> sw 

MARTIN: Hey, Rory - we're at the Farmland. You can come back. Rory? Hrm. From the farmland, we can go into the cottage or over to the barn. There's also a hedgehog. 

> x hedgehog
> hedgehog, hi

MARTIN: The hedgehog and W.D. can understand each other, but communication is still difficult. The notable thing here is that the hedgehog is hungry. 

> s

MARTIN: If you've played the Introcomp release, you probably remember the cottage. In the full game, there's a second room further to the south. 

First, let's check out the fireplace. We can ignore the farming tools. 

> x fireplace
> x chimney
> take brick
> take parchment
> x parchment

MARTIN: If you remember all the way back to "ask mel about money", he does happen to mention insurance fraud. 

> x scarf
> take scarf

MARTIN: Fashion!

> w
> x basket
> x lever
> pull lever

MARTIN: W.D. has a serious egg problem.

> take egg

MARTIN: Really serious. 

> pull lever
> pull lever
> pull lever
> pull lever
> take egg

MARTIN: _Really_ serious. There are an infinite number of eggs and W.D. has infinite stomach capacity. Hm. Is Rory back? No? Rory got _really_ sick doing this scene. Rory does not have infinite stomach capacity. 

> e
> n
> w

MARTIN: This brings us to the barn, which is the final location in the main map. Here we have a beautiful, brand-new building, which we now know was just insured for some amount of money, hopefully a large amount. Our path is clear. 
RORY: I'm back! I brought coffee. I got you a latte. 
MARTIN: Thanks, Rory. Also, good timing. I was just about to start solving puzzles. 
RORY: Awesome. Time to burn down the barn? 
MARTIN: Time to burn down the barn. 

PART 3: TIME TO BURN DOWN THE BARN, AND OTHER SIMPLE PUZZLES

RORY: If you've jumped straight to Part 3, we're at the Barn. 

> x hay

RORY: This hay is very dry. It would be a shame if something happened to it. 
MARTIN: Now, we don't directly have a fire source, but if you examine our vast pile of objects, we do have an explosion source. 
RORY: (If you haven't already waved the magic wand to get a faery coin, you should do that now.) 

> wave wand
> take coin
> x coin
> x salt

MARTIN: Faery coins explode if you put salt on them. We have salt. Now, it's not a very big explosion; don't go thinking you can blow off the castle doors. But this hay is quite dry ... 

> put faery on hay
> put salt on faery

RORY: And now we _leave_. 
MARTIN: If you're feeling suicidal, you can stand there and watch W.D. burn to death, but we like winning. 
RORY: And in case you're worrying that I have a poor charred stunt double somewhere, _that_ scene was CGI. 

> e

MARTIN: In your playthrough, we encourage you to stop at Farmland and watch the barn burn down, but we're going to get a move on. 
RORY: This next bit is different from Introcomp. In the initial release, there was an insurance salesman at the stock market who you could turn the policy into. Now you'll need to turn it in at the bank. 

> e
> n
> n
> n
> e
> e
> give parchment to teller

RORY: Yay money!
MARTIN: I'm going to walk you through giving the check to Mel now. This will teach you about buying ingredients. After this, we'll just hold them till the end. 

> w
> w
> s
> e
> give check to mel

MARTIN: Now you've gotten the right to buy one ingredient. For full points, you'll need to buy all seven. You can win the game starting with the four-ingredient potion. 
RORY: If you are playing the game on your own and not just following the walkthrough, we recommend not buying any ingredients until you've given up on puzzles. 
MARTIN: Right. The five-ingredient potion needs a different set from the four-ingredient potion. So you don't want to buy three ingredients and then realize they're only useful if you manage to finish all seven puzzles. 

> buy ingredient
> midas potion

RORY: We're actually saying "Midas potion" here because that backs you out of the buying dialog. We've successfully gotten the check out of our inventory; we'll buy all seven ingredients at once later. 

MARTIN: Now we'll do Puzzle 2: The Riddle Trail.
RORY: This is the puzzle connected to the red note. Each note clues a location in the game. You go there and get the next note. Repeat. 

> read red note

MARTIN: We're told to go to the left elbow of Blue Fever's brother. If you'll recall, Blue Fever is mentioned on the plaque underneath the statue on Mindo Street. 

> w
> n 
> w
> x left elbow
> take violet note
> read violet note

RORY: We saw forms in the bank.

> e
> e
> search forms for x1-fsb

MARTIN: The treasure hunt involves a couple of uses of "search X for Y".
RORY: This is about two hundred commands too late, but if you haven't tried "ABOUT" by now, it points you to"ABOUT VERBS", which lists some verbs you might not otherwise think to try. 

> take green note
> read green note

RORY: There is only one place in town that contains pans of meat. You'll notice the note doesn't specify which kind of meat is the favorite, but there are only three options. 
MARTIN: Also, it's the pork pan, to save you two commands. 

> w
> s
> look under pork pan
> take yellow note
> read yellow note

RORY: I am sorry to say that the only purpose the Exploding Cockroaches serve in this game is to point you back to Mel's via this note. 
MARTIN: Yeah, this was a missed opportunity. One of the script editors said there were plans for a big bug race, but, you know, budget issues...

> e
> search trinkets for cedar
> take cedar
> open cedar
> take ring

MARTIN: We're bad people. 
RORY: It's in a pile of things in a store. What's to say someone completely innocent didn't buy it by accident? Also, yeah, we're bad people. 

> give ring to mel 

MARTIN: Might as well get rid of the ring, since we're right here. 
RORY: We actually talked about this at the cast party and we decided that Mel is totally on to you and just doesn't care. 
MARTIN: Well, Mel is _actually_ good at magic. What's going to happen to him? Maybe he'll have to turn a couple of guards into toads or something. 
RORY: All right. Time for the last two simple puzzles. Conveniently, they both involve the same location. Off to rob the bank. 
MARTIN: It's funnier if we do it in the other order. 
RORY: Hm. Good point. Okay, Puzzle 3: Two-Handed Bart.

> w
> n
> e

MARTIN: We're back in the bank lobby. 

> x poster
> x man

RORY: W.D. thinks the guy looks a little like Two-Handed Bart. 
MARTIN: He's _not_ Two-Handed Bart, but that's irrelevant. 
RORY: The poster describes Bart. He's got shiny hair, a handlebar mustache, and a green scarf. Our man has a hat on, a wispy mustache, and no scarf. So we need to fix that. 

> x scarf

MARTIN: Hm. It's yellow. Wrong color. 

> x dye
> dye scarf
> give scarf to man

RORY: Okay. One down. He's got the wrong kind of mustache, but we can fix this. 

> x mustache

MARTIN: ... W.D. may interrupt you here. 

> x mustache
> wind mustache
> wind mustache

RORY: You may have to wind it more or fewer times to get it into the right shape. You want the handlebar mustache.

> give mustache to man

MARTIN: We're nearly done, but we have to get rid of the hat. Disambiguation here - you can refer to his hat as "fedora" and skip the "do you 

mean the unhat or the hat or the fedora or the ordinary man" ridiculousness that you get sometimes. 

> take fedora

RORY: He won't let us take the hat. This is okay, though, because we have the essence of anti-hat. 

> put unhat on man

RORY: Okay, now we're good. We just have to summon the guard ...

> w
> pull cord

MARTIN: Now we need to collect the reward. 

> w 
> w 
> n
> show poster to guard

RORY: More treasure for us! And now we're in the right place to start robbing the bank. 

> x evidence 
> look in crack

MARTIN: You can see there are now more things in the evidence cabinet. Who knows where Two-Handed Bart has gone? 
RORY: All right. We need to blow open this cabinet. Where have we seen explosions before? 

> s
> e
> s
> get salt
> n
> w
> n

MARTIN: Darn you, Mendolyn! All right, we've gotten more salt from Sandie. 

> wave wand
> get faery
> put faery in crack
> put salt in crack

RORY: Now in some sense this is Failure #3, because the door stays on, but it alerts the guard, which is good enough. 

> z

MARTIN: Come on, man, wake up. 

> z 

RORY: Now we have one turn to grab things. 

> get scrap from cabinet

MARTIN: You can duplicate these steps and try to grab the device, but we're not going to do that here, because it doesn't actually work. The device is too bulky and the guard will notice you. There's another way to get the device, which we'll talk about in the next section. 
RORY: I dropped that thing on my claws at least twice. 
MARTIN: Hey, it was an authentically heavy prop. No cardboard boulders for us. 
RORY: Oy. Anyway, what the heck does this scrap even say? 

> x scrap

MARTIN: Hey, some bozo tried to rob the bank! 
RORY: Hey, look! A note! We don't need to speak People if we have a _note_!
MARTIN: Hey, Rory, do you like crime? 
RORY: Hell yeah, I like me some crime. Let's robbinate. 

> s
> e

MARTIN: Now, as you may recall from the previous puzzle, _there is an alarm system_. 

> break cord

RORY: But I'm awesome, so whatever. 

> e
> e 
> show scrap to teller

MARTIN: And now W.D. is the King of Moneyville. Good job. 

PART 4: THE HARD PUZZLES

RORY: Technically, you can win the game now; four puzzles is the minimum necessary. You can skip down to Part 5 if you want that. But now it's time for the good stuff. 
MARTIN: Puzzle 5: Robbing the Blind involves several parts and requires doing a timed event correctly. 
RORY: So we have this blind beggar in Big Street, South. He can't see you but he can hear you. So you need to make a really loud distraction so that you can steal the coin without him noticing. 
MARTIN: Now, there is a place in the game that's very loud. It's the one place in the game where "listen" does something special. 

> w 
> n
> listen

RORY: As W.D. says, the stock market is a zoo. Somewhat ... literally, I guess. These animals would be _really loud_ if we could get them to the beggar. 
MARTIN: We have a bunch of barely controlled animals, and we need to get them from Point A to Point Not A. We need to startle them, and then nature will take its course. 
RORY: Its chaotic, chaotic course. 
MARTIN: Right. Everybody loves a stampede. So we need a loud noise to startle the animals. 
RORY: Hey, wait, you're going to send them on the wrong track. You can't use the coin-and-salt trick here. The coin isn't actually loud. It's just bright. 
MARTIN: Ah, yes. You want less "explode" and more "pop". 
RORY: We're going for the balloon, if that's not clear. 
MARTIN: But you also shouldn't try to pop the balloon yourself. Standing in front of a stampede when it starts isn't very safe. (Feel free to try it and then "undo", if you like.) 
RORY: Now, you need someone _else_ to pop the balloon for you. 
MARTIN: Someone who might pop the balloon accidentally. 
RORY: Right. Someone kind of ... pointy.
MARTIN: DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! 
RORY: ... 

> s
> w
> w
> sw
> ask hedgehog about stampede

MARTIN: Okay, asking the hedgehog about a stampede won't really work. You can't actually get a word in edgewise with the hedghog. 
RORY: I think you mean _hedgewise_, amirite amirite? 
MARTIN: Did you get an Irish coffee, by any chance? 
RORY: Hey, it was funny!

MARTIN: Reader, I know this is text, but I promise you I'm glaring at Rory. Anyhoo, no matter what you try to say to the hedgehog, he just 

obsessively asks for food and tells you how pointy he is. 

> hedgehog, go east

MARTIN: And you can't give him orders. 

> show balloon to hedgehog

RORY: But he _does_ like toys. 
MARTIN: We don't want to give him the balloon right away, because he'll be completely engrossed once he gets it. So let's go drop the balloon where we need it, and then come back. 

> nw
> e
> ne
> drop balloon
> sw
> w
> sw

RORY: All right. The hedgehog won't do anything we want. I guess we're forced to _listen_ to him. Let's feed him. 

> wave rod

RORY: You may recall that the fishing rod creates insects. Hedgehogs are insectivores, if you didn't know. You can also give him fish, but the fish are a pain to get. As soon as you wave the fishing rod, the hedghog will snarf the bait. 

> nw

RORY: And he'll follow you. You'll need to keep feeding him every few turns to keep him following you. 

> e
> wave rod
> ne

MARTIN: Now we've dragged the hedgehog to the stock market. He will start playing with the balloon. Now you need to book it to Big Street, South. The hedgehog will pop the balloon in a random but low number of turns. 

> sw
> s
> s

RORY: From here, wait until the stampede actually hits this location...

> z
> z
> z

MARTIN: You may need more or fewer than three turns.
RORY: Then grab the coin!

> get strange
> n

RORY: Yoink!
MARTIN: If you don't want to try to time your waiting, you can also just type "get strange" repeatedly and when it works, it works. 
RORY: The kid who plays the hedgehog was eight, in case you were wondering. So the screechy singing is authentic. 
MARTIN: He was a good kid. He was just really boisterous. 
RORY: And we'd like to point out that no actual animals were harmed in this. Just fake ones. We hear that our hedgehog actor went back to school and has been excitedly telling everyone that he got flattened by a cow in his first acting job.  

MARTIN: Now it's time for Puzzle 6: The Mysterious Device.
RORY: If this phrase means anything to you, this is Speculative Fiction's version of the Babelfish puzzle. 
MARTIN: The puzzle has a lot of steps and it's easy to break things at any step, so be prepared to restart it a lot.
RORY: You shouldn't have to undo or restore save games. But you might find it easier to "undo" than to run back to grab items again. 
MARTIN: First, let's grab the device. We know from an earlier puzzle that you can drop a faery coin and some salt into the crack in the evidence cabinet, and that will cause a guard to open the cabinet for a turn. But the device is big and bulky, and the guard will stop you from taking it. 
RORY: So we need to get the device "legitimately." We've been carrying around this vellum page which is some kind of requisition form for the device. 

> n
> w
> n
> show vellum to guard

MARTIN: The guard isn't impressed. And he tears up our form. That jerk! Frederick tried this trick a lot, though, so we'll just get another one. 

> look in wastebasket
> take vellum
> read vellum
> x signature

RORY: The major problem here is the signature. Even W.D. knows it's a bad forgery. Even the idiot downstairs knows it's a bad forgery. We gotta do better than this. Let's start over.

> x clear
> pour clear on signature

MARTIN: Now we have an unsigned sheet of paper, and a very sleepy civil servant with a stamp. 

> u
> put vellum on stack
> z
> take vellum
> read vellum

MARTIN: That's better. It's an official stamp! Who can disagree with an official stamp?

> d
> give vellum to guard

RORY: I feel like many problems in this world were caused by the city guards not caring. 
MARTIN: Nononoo. You're looking at it wrong. Many problems are _solved_ by the city guards not caring. Besides, there's that one guard from the ransom job. He knows it's not really Two-Handed Bart. 
RORY: Maybe Bill and him will team up in the sequel or something. 
MARTIN: Speculative Fiction 2: This Time It's Personal.
RORY: Yeah, so we have this device. 

> x device
> x tray
> push green button
> push blue button
> push red button

MARTIN: Oooh, oooh, maybe it's an instruction manual...

> take pamphlet
> read pamphlet

MARTIN: Er, well ... kind of. So the device needs:
   1.) Some wool
   2.) A bottle of blue dye, in the bottle
   3.) An unbroken egg
You put objects in the tray and press the blue button to load them. Then you press the green button to get money. 
RORY: Well, we have wool. 

> put wool on tray
> push blue button

MARTIN: And we have blue dye. 

> put blue dye on tray
> push blue button

RORY: Now we just need an egg! This puzzle is easy!
RORY AND MARTIN: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 

MARTIN: Okay, as you may recall, W.D. is basically a black hole when it comes to eggs. So we have to somehow get an egg into this machine without W.D. being able to eat it. 

RORY: Let's go back to the egg dispenser. 

> s
> sw
> s
> w

MARTIN: We already know he immediately eats the egg. Maybe we can put the egg into a container? 

> put vase in basket
> pull lever

MARTIN: Okay, the egg breaks, which isn't useful. However, you'll notice W.D. can't get the egg while it's inside the vase, which is useful. 
RORY: The machine won't accept a broken egg, so let's get rid of it. 

> break vase
> z
> z
> z
> z
> z
> take vase

RORY: The vase is magic. It reappears five turns after it disappears, so you can 
MARTIN: Maaaaaybe we can cushion it? 
RORY: What do we have that's soft? We just used up the blanket bit. 
MARTIN: And the whole blanket wouldn't fit anyway. Hey, you know what was soft? That scarf we gave to Two-Handed Bart. 
RORY: But Two-Handed Bart got disappeared! 
MARTIN: But his stuff ended up in the evidence locker. 
RORY: So ... back to the salt mines?
 
> e
> n
> e
> n
> n
> take salt
> n
> w
> n
> wave wand
> take faery
> put faery in crack
> put salt in crack
> z
> z
> get scarf

MARTIN: Phew. I'm tired just reading that. 
RORY: But we have the scarf!

> put scarf in vase

RORY: Note that the scarf is still sticking out a little. So if you are doing this puzzle before the ransom puzzle, you can get it back out. 
MARTIN: The vase is notable in that it's "very narrow". W.D. can't get his head in there. 
RORY: And once there's an egg in there, he'll be too blinded by its holy egginess to think of tipping the vase over. 
MARTIN: You're forgetting your own lines, Rory. W.D. tries to tip over the vase but the egg gets stuck. 
RORY: Grrr. I resent the implication that birds are this stupid.
MARTIN: Hey, I spend the whole game lying on a stone floor. 
RORY: What about the endgame? 
MARTIN: Okay, okay, two minutes of glory. ANYWAY...

> s
> sw
> s
> w

MARTIN: Back in the Pantry.

> put vase in basket
> pull lever

RORY: Now we have a vase with an egg in it, and W.D. can't get at the egg. 
MARTIN: But there's going to be a problem at the other end. We'll have to take the egg out of the vase and then W.D. will eat it. 
RORY: So we'll have to keep him from getting at the egg a different way. 
MARTIN: To get the egg initially, we had to put it into a container. To get rid of the egg, we'll have to put W.D. in a ... container.
RORY: Let's go back to the device. 

> take vase
> e
> n
> nw
> n
> take device
> s

MARTIN: The device is too heavy for W.D. to carry. But he can push it. 

> drop device
> push device s
> push device w

MARTIN: This has got to make an extremely strange sight for any passerby. "Hm, there's a bird pushing a metal box and frantically trying to stick its head in a vase." 
RORY: I really hope I get cast in a dramatic role someday. 

> take scarf

MARTIN: We'll need to remove the scarf from the vase or else the device will reject the egg. 

> put vase on tray
> get device
> enter circle
> drop device

RORY: We'll also need to remove the vase from the egg. W.D. is ::grumble:: apparently too "bird-brained" to think of this one himself. 
MARTIN: Note the timing here. You have to take the fish the turn before you free the egg, or else W.D. will have time to eat it. 

> take fish
> break vase

MARTIN: Sproing! Now W.D. can't reach the egg, 'cause he's in the cage. 

> push blue button

RORY: Of course, W.D. also can't reach the button that will get rid of the egg...
MARTIN: Ha ha, but Frederick the wizard, tool-using mammal, will save the day!

> push blue button with wand

RORY: Now the egg's gone and you can get W.D. out of the cage.

> break cage
> break cage
> break cage

MARTIN: At some point, the vase will reform itself. Surprise. It's magic. 

> push green button
> take counterfeit
> exit circle

RORY: Regardless of what the machine says, Mel will accept this money. 
MARTIN: In theory we could go get another egg and another bottle of dye, but the blanket represents the only wool in the entire kingdom, so we're done here. 
RORY: We're ready for the last of the pre-endgame puzzles. Puzzle 7: Playing the Stock Market.
MARTIN: This is a two-stage puzzle. In the first stage, you'll need to crack the mystery of the merchants and successfully buy a stock. In the second stage, you'll need to artificially inflate the price of the stock you just bought. 
RORY: It's now finally time to deal with the merchants. 

> e
> e
> ne

MARTIN: The merchants are immune to stampedes, by the way. A wizard did it. 
RORY: But not you. You're incompetent. 
MARTIN: Mel probably did it. 
RORY: If you haven't already examined the merchants...

> x merchants

RORY: ... will cause W.D. to assign them names. You'll need to be able to disambiguate them. 
MARTIN: Here we have eight merchants, and an auctioneer selling stock in various animals. If you wait for enough turns, you'll see that different stocks sell for different amounts of money. Every bid doubles the price of a stock. Bidding starts at one florin. You have one florin. 
RORY: Each merchant cares about a different attribute. You'll need to figure out what each merchant likes and dislikes, and then pick a stock which no merchant wants. You'll be able to buy that stock for a single florin. 
MARTIN: The auctioneer randomly selects animals, but will never select the animal that's the puzzle solution. You can, however, suggest stocks to him with "search coffer for <animal>". 

> search coffer for dog

RORY: You may have to enter this command a couple of times; the auctioneer only takes suggestions right as one auction is ending. "dog" isn't the answer, by the way; it's just an example.
MARTIN: You can bid via "buy certificate with florin", but any other merchant can outbid you. 

> buy certificate with florin

RORY: If you examine the individual merchants, you can get a vague hint as to what they like. 

> x rupertina
> x sunshine
> x fnyrx
> x elspeth
> x percival
> x demonspoon
> x rombert
> x hortensia

RORY: Also as another hint, two of the merchants care about the attributes of the animals themselves. The other six care about attributes of the _names_ of the animals. 
MARTIN: So this is mostly a word puzzle. 
RORY: For the record, we didn't know about any of this ourselves. The writers gave us a list.
MARTIN: There are some _hilarious_ outtakes of the merchants trying to remember their lines. 
RORY: "One!" "Four!" "Six! No, wait, three! Wait, do I even like cows?" 
MARTIN: The crew laughed for a good five minutes. 

ALESSANDRA: What's up, home fries? 
RORY: Alessandra?! You came! 
MARTIN: I thought you were filming!
ALESSANDRA: We had to wrap early. Fatal bug - turned out you could "take" the dragon. 
MARTIN: Ooooh. Classic blunder. 
RORY: Hey, now that you're hee, want to read the merchant list? 
ALESSANDRA: Uh, sure. Lessee...
   One only likes land animals (including amphibians)
   One only likes animals with legs
   One only likes animals who don't have any doubled letters in their names
   One only likes animals with five or fewer letters in their names
   One only likes animals with nine or greater letters in their names
   One only likes animals with an even number of letters in their names
   One only likes animals whose names cannot be beheaded to form a new word. "So crow is bad because if you take off the c you get row, but dog is good because if you take off the d you don't get a word." 
   One only likes animals whose names cannot have their third letter changed to form a new word. "So dog is bad because you can change the g and get dot, but snake is good because snike or snoke or whatever aren't words." 

   ... What? 

RORY: Thanks, Alessandra. 
ALESSANDRA: Was this from the stock puzzle? I didn't really see it because I spent the whole time in Big Street, Center. 
MARTIN: Yeah. I didn't really see it either. I just heard about it later. 
RORY: We should give them the actual answer. 
MARTIN: Right. Alessandra? 
ALESSANDRA: Okay, wait, I lost my place ... Ah. You know from the two lengths that you want an animal whose name is between six and eight letters. From the even merchant, you know you want a seven letter name. From the land animal and leg animal merchants, you know you want a sea creature. You also know it must have a doubled letter, that it must form a new word if you change the third letter, and that the last six letters must spell a word. The answer is herring. 
MARTIN: Okay, knowing all that, you still have to enter the right commands: 

> search coffer for herring
> give florin to auctioneer
> z

RORY: I think we may have said this before, but you can only suggest a stock right as one auction is ending, so you might have to time the 
"search coffer for herring" command right. Nothing bad happens if you try it at the wrong time; it just doesn't work. 
MARTIN: Ta-da! Now you've done part one of the puzzle. 
ALESSANDRA: That was part ONE?
MARTIN: Well, in some sense that was part 2. Part 1 was getting the florin, although that isn't too hard. 
ALESSANDRA: Clearly I missed a lot by staying in the meats stall. 
RORY: Once you've bought your share of Consolidated Herring Securities, the merchants go off to have coffee and the auctioneer sets up a stock ticker. Now you get to play with another mysterious device. 
MARTIN: Right. The stock certificate you have now isn't worth anything. You'll have to hack the ticker to convince the auctioneer that it's 

valuable, and then sell it back to him. 
 
> x ticker
> push red button
> push yellow button
> z 

RORY: Pushing the red button spits out some mysterious text, and pushing the yellow button causes the stock ticker to start displaying stock 

values. If you wait a few turns, you'll see it rotates through the same five stocks. 

> x panel
> open panel  

MARTIN: Inside the device you'll find six colored wires and six places you can plug those wires in. 
ALESSANDRA: I'm getting a headache. Goodnight, guys. 
RORY: Aw. 
MARTIN: Any time, Alessandra. 
RORY: Again, aw. All right. Let's finish this puzzle. 

> disconnect black wossname
> z

RORY: You can see the stock ticker's display has changed. If you push the red button again: 

> push red button

RORY: You can see that's changed too. 
MARTIN: The wires somehow connect the incoming stock data to the external display. 
RORY: Where the "incoming stock data" is coming in through magic or something. 

> disconnect brown wossname
> connect black wossname to brown receptacle
> connect brown wossname to black receptacle
> push red button

MARTIN: You can see the ordering of the alphabet has changed. So now the input data's been warped and the ticker's displaying a different set of stocks. 
RORY: According to the notes which the writers gave us, the device is using a six bit input - each of the letters and numbers corresponds to a six-bit number. By swapping the wires around, you change what letters and numbers the device displays. 
MARTIN: You can keep changing wires and checking the red button until you get the alphabet in an order you like. But here's the answer:

> connect yellow wossname to orange receptacle

> connect red wossname to brown receptacle

MARTIN: You can leave the green wossname - er, wire - in place. 
RORY: At this point the ticker will tell you that CHS (Consolidated Herring Securities) is up 37, um, units. 

> give certificate to auctioneer

MARTIN: And ... that's the seven main-game puzzles. 
RORY: LET'S TAKE THIS TRAIN TO THE ENDGAME.

PART 5: THE ENDGAME

RORY: Okay, so there's one and a half endgames. First we have to give all the ingredients to Mel and go make the potion. This part is not timed. 

> sw
> s
> e

RORY: Back to Mel's. 

> give sovereign to mel
> give sack to mel

MARTIN: Once you give Mel four treasures, which will be now if you're following the walkthrough, Mel will unlock a secret trapdoor in the floor. This will let you go down to the "sekkrit laboratory" and make the potion. 
RORY: Mel unlocks the trapdoor at four treasures because that's the minimum you need to make a potion which won't get you killed. So you can stop at four or keep going for more points. 
MARTIN: We, of course, want more points. 

> give banknote to mel 
> give reward money to mel
> give strange coin to mel

MARTIN: Make sure to check the recipes before you start buying things. 

> buy all ingredients

RORY: If you haven't solved all seven potions, you can do "buy <ingredient>" with a specific name. The page you got from the alchemy bench will give you the list of options. Or "buy ingredient" will _also_ give you the list of options. 
MARTIN: Now we'll save our game and go downstairs. I'm specifically suggesting saving now because you can get different endings depending on which potion you make. 

> save
> whatever pick a save name
> d

RORY: And now we're in the secret laboratory.

> x sign

RORY: Did we mention to save your game? 

> x pot
> x liquid

MARTIN: Here we have the potion-o-matic. Now. Do NOT add anything to the pot that is not part of one of the potion recipes. You won't get it back and you'll ruin any potion you have in progress.

> put kidney in pot
> put whiskey in pot
> put starmetal in pot
> put ash in pot
> put blood in pot
> put runestone in pot
> put fur in pot

MARTIN: Alternatively, use "put all ingredients in pot". 
RORY: Nearly there...

> press sigil
> i

MARTIN: There's a potion! W.D. will tell you to go back to your body. Well, W.D. will tell you to tell him to take him and your mind back to your body. 

> u
> w
> s
> s
> u

RORY: Oh no! NOT ANOTHER CUT SCENE!
MARTIN: And now we're at the "real" endgame. This part is timed. You'll only need three turns to finish, though.
RORY: Now, if you don't have a valid potion, you are going to die. I hope you saved when we told you to. 
MARTIN: We start at the bottom of the tower. The treasurer will take a few turns to get the lift started. W.D. can just fly up. 

> u
> n

RORY: Everything in the vault is a mess. 

> x logs

MARTIN: These are the logs which Frederick the wizard put here so that the Perfectly Foolproof Illusion could have some objects to work on. 
RORY: Now, you have two options. One, you could: 

> pour potion on logs

RORY: ... and watch that ending. Or, you could "z" until W.D. says "Uh oh. They're here." Then...

> pour potion on treasurer

MARTIN: Obviously, the latter option only works if you have the full Midas potion. 
RORY: You'll get a winning ending with "pour potion on logs" for any potion that required at least four ingredients. 

PART 6: CRAZY ACTIONS YOU SHOULD DO SO SOMEONE SEES ALL OF THIS TEXT DEAR GOD WE INTENDED FOR THIS GAME TO BE SHORT

MARTIN: Once you've won, you should check "AMUSING" for some random fun things you can do in the game. 

RORY: My personal recommendation is that you put the costuming parts on "Two-Handed Bart" one at a time and pull the cord after each one. You can't actually make that puzzle unwinnable, so the guards get more and more ridiculous as you summon them over and over. 
MARTIN: I also like trying to go back to the barn after you've burned it down. 
RORY: Try having W.D. drink the potion as soon as you make it. 
MARTIN: Oh, that's a good one. He'll run through all the puzzles you've solved, complaining about each one. 
RORY: Try popping the balloon in the stock market if you want to watch me die. ::sniff:: You're not that cruel, right? Also, if you wait while the hedgehog plays with the balloon, you can see him try to befriend it.
MARTIN: Oh, oh! Goofy endings. I think the five-ingredient potion is pretty exciting. 
RORY: SO MANY EXTRAS. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that was exciting to film. Also, if you do have the full Midas potion, you could try pouring it on the other people in the room. 
RORY: I find the "pour potion on guard" ending pretty funny for W.D. 
MARTIN: You can also get killed by going to the endgame and just waiting until the treasurer has you executed. That ending kills Frederick but not W.D. Or you can do "pour potion on wizard" if you hate us. 
RORY: I guess in some sense that's the ending we deserve for all the havoc we wreak, but come on man, it's funny!
MARTIN: Hm, random things to try. Oh, if you break the alarm cord and then wait around, a workman comes and repairs it. That's actually a cameo by our Executive Producer. 
RORY: Oh, and W.D.'s girlfriend does not actually appear in the game, if you're wondering. 
MARTIN: Well, I've finished my coffee (thanks again, Rory!) and you've finished the game, so I think that's time to call it a day. 
RORY: Yeah! Thanks again for playing! We hope to see you in another game!
Supernova Walkthrough  (Apogee Software)
By Ramon Bartschat (bartschat@goldnet.sk)

I will only describe the shortest way. 
And I will omit many details. There are many more rooms and objects you should explore on your own.

In between the described steps you will have to eat, drink and sleep.
-Sleeping can be done in your hotel room bed or spaceship bed.
-You can drink your beer and then refill the mug at a water tap at either your room or your spaceships bathroom. You can also drink directly from the water tap.
-You can only eat the food from the old storehouse; careful it is for a limited amount of times.

START
- Buy a beer, sit at the middle table, wait for the aliens to sit down and then "listen carefully" to all they have to say, write down the coordinates they mention.
(Notice that the holster in your room is of no use in the game, also the rusty key is only needed to open your hotel room, nothing else)
- Go outside to the old storehouse and get the satchel with food (you don't need the satchel, just the food)


(SPECIAL CHEAT
- Go W on the Dusty Road until you "notice something unusual" then type ENTER or IN
This will take you directly to the ice planet with all the items you need and you will not be hungry, thirsty or sleepy)


WITHOUT CHEAT
- Go to your spaceship
- Go to the cockpit, place the cushion on the seat and sit down.
- To make it past security you have to provide the same "identity code name" you defined at beginning the game
- Fly to the coordinates you overheard from the aliens in the bar (R2/20-8-23 D2/VEGA)
- Initiate the countdown and rush for your cryo tube
- Keep trying to land (pushing the button) until you do so.
- Get out of your spaceship and head for the pyramid. Careful to "jump stream" to avoid the acid stream.
- When you get stung by the animal return to your spaceships laboratory and get serum number 6 (Poisons/Venoms). Put the empty mug in the niche for the serum. The serum dispenser will work only 2 times but you will not need it any more, only this one time.
- Get the cushion you will need it in the pyramid
- Return now all the way to the pyramid.
- Open the mouth of the dog, take the jewel and open the pyramid door with it.
- Get down to the skeleton room; get the grey disk (you don't need the skull)
- Go to the mini-pyramid room; touch the pyramid to open the secret passage. 
- Enter the secret room and get the dusty ball, clean the ball, throw the ball at the wall to extract the shiny key (Should the secret door close then "turn podium" to open it again or just leave the room before it closes)
- Go to the mirror room. In the mirror room go NW-S-SE-E-NE-W-SE and then DOWN. (You might have to try several times until you don't bump into a wall any more)
- Drop all you have except the cushion and the shiny key (You will need to carry a heavy rod later)
- Head for the other mini-pyramid room
- Put the cushion on the floor, put the shiny key in the keyhole, catch the crystal (wait a little for a secret room to open)
- Get back to the round room and take the rod
- CRAWL NORTH, JUMP GAP, PUT ROD IN RECESS
- Go and take all the items you left before. 
- Go back through the mirror room NW-E-SE-S-NW-SE and UP  (again you might have to try several times to go in a certain direction until you don't bump into a wall)
- Go back to where the big climbable tree is. A new way heading SW will be available now.
- Follow the SW track and enter the Antenna Building  (From now on, when you find things to read, read them backwards - SDRAWKCAB)
- Go to the transport booth and push the button
- Go find the robot in the Reactor Control room, "open panel" and get the plastic card
- Open the closed door with the plastic card, enter and get the suit
- Go to the transport boot and push the purple button to get the goggles, push the cyan button to go to the ice planet. Use the tan button to get back to the planet with your spaceship (to refill water or to sleep for example)


ON THE ICE PLANET (in reality a giant planet size spaceship)
- Enter the building and put the grey disk in the slot
- DROP ALL! If not you will loose all when the robot comes. You will find the grey disk here again, you don't need it.
- Wait for the robot to zap you and then get all your possessions again.
- Wear the suit and go out to the circular corridor
- Go to the Transmission room and turn off the alarm (this is not a necessary step though)
- Go to the Maintenance room, find and get the gloves (you don't need the "device" found there)
- Go to the closed door -the one with the picture of a cryogenic tube- and open it with the plastic card
- Enter to the Emergency Override room and Hit the cryo tube with the mug to free the scientist
- Either wait for the scientist here or follow him (you will end up in the same room again anyhow; following him gives you a clue where to check which crystal is damaged)
- Give him the clear crystal
- Wait to hear all his instructions
- Head for the elevator and go to the level the scientist mentioned you (480)
- Now is the time to wear the goggles (to cross the catwalk) and the gloves (to touch the crystals)
- Exit the elevator and head for the Reactor Regulator room where the panel with the crystals is 
- The robot in Security Tunnel Number 3 will shoot you, you cannot avoid it.
- Open the panel and get the blue crystal
- Place your clear crystal in the socket


That is about it.
Remember, there are many more rooms and objects you should investigate.

WALKTHROUGH FOR VACATION GONE AWRY
                ------------------

_Vacation Gone Awry_, by Johan Berntsson, Fredrik Ramsberg, and
Staffan Friberg is available at:

http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/Vacation.z5

(you may have to watch for line breaks in that URL)

Note:  _Vacation Gone Awry_ has in-game hints.  Before resorting
to the walkthrough, you may want to get as far in the game as
possible, using those hints.

This file is a little discursive, including some actions which are
not necessary to complete the game.  However, they should make the
experience more enjoyable.  The exact phrases you will need to type
into the interpreter are in ALL CAPS.

This walkthrough is based on Release 2 / Serial number 020130 / Inform
v6.15 Library 6/2

THE CABIN
---------

You're on vacation in Germany, with your wife and daughters.  And (to
quote the game) "as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you
find that your family is gone..."

You begin in the bedroom.  If you examine all the furniture (X BED, LOOK
UNDER BED, LOOK AT TABLE, etc.), you will find out more about what kind
of people you and your family are.  But the only thing you really need to
do here is OPEN CLOSET, and then SEARCH CLOTHES (GET CLOTHES will also
work).

(On the second turn you will hear something passing overhead.  Remember
this!)

SW will take you to the living room.  Again, looking at all the things
mentioned in the room description will add to your knowledge of your family
(X RUG, X FIREPLACE, X SOFA, LOOK UNDER SOFA).  (If you've played Zork, try
typing MOVE RUG.)  Play around with things, and make sure to X TABLE.  You'll
see a tiny piece of paper.  X PAPER (READ PAPER would also work).

Aha, so that's where they are.  And you now have a tentative mission: drive
to town to go shopping.

You can go NW to the kitchen if you like; X TILES is kind of intriguing, and
you could GET GAME and PLAY GAME for a while.  But it doesn't really get you
anywhere.

(Hmmm... where do these people go to the bathroom?  I guess it isn't
important.  :)

From the living room, S takes you outside--it's cold, so you should WEAR
SWEATER.  You could walk S to the road and try walking S again--okay, you'll
need the car.  Go back N to the driveway.

You'll be gone for a while; better CLOSE FRONT DOOR.  ENTER CAR, CLOSE CAR
DOOR, and TURN ON THE CAR.  Ick, the stereo!  (Try LISTEN TO STEREO for a
good time... not.)

DRIVE SOUTH (or just S would work) twice and --

Uh-oh.  (So *that's* what passed overhead on the second turn of the game.)
Here it's important to notice: the sphere is beta radiant (dangerous to
expose yourself to it for long periods of time); it will kill everyone
in the vicinity (including you and your unwitting family); you have to
go get the sphere from the center and bring it back here to the aliens.

Your car is off now, so TURN ON ENGINE, and you can see that a smaller
road leads WEST, so follow it.

OUT gets you out of the car (automatically turning off the engine).  

CABLE CAR TERMINAL AREA
-----------------------

You may want to explore a bit: NORTH then DOWN takes you to an iron
door, which you can't open (at least not yet... but it's good to know
that it's there).  UP then SOUTH takes you back to the parking lot.

(SOUTHWEST takes you to a garage, but you don't need to go here.  It
just gives you another option for the next puzzle.  From the garage,
EAST goes back to the parking area.)

From there NORTHWEST and WEST gets to the actual Cable Car Terminal.

You'll see a trunk; OPEN it, GET all the contents (the bag and wrench).
Then CLOSE TRUNK.  (I don't know if it's necessary, but listen:
someone's hanging around and whistling, and you don't want them to know
you're here.)

You want to get across the wire.  There are three ways (at least) to do
it.  I did it the hard way, so here's that one:

Your goal is to get the guy who's whistling to ferry you over.  To do
that, you'll need to hide on the roof of the car.  But once he comes into
the room, you'll have to already be hidden.  So prepare the car:

ENTER CAR. UP. OPEN HATCH. DOWN. EXIT.

Now you can lure the guy out:

KNOCK ON DOOR. ENTER CAR. U. U.

WAIT twice and you'll see the service man come out of his door.  He
looks around for you and can't find you (I wonder why?).  He decides
to leave anyway.  WAIT three more times and you will be at...

THE CENTER
----------

or more specifically at the Upper Cable Car Terminal.

If you try to get on the floor, there's no way to avoid being seen.
Instead STAND ON WIRE and WAIT five times for the man to leave with
the car.

Don't be afraid: type DOWN and you will land safely every time.

Pursuing your goal to pick up everything that isn't nailed down (a
usual strategy for adventure games), you'll want to OPEN CHEST, GET
everything from it (chain and cutters), and CLOSE CHEST.  Again, it's
probably not necessary to close it, but I worry that someone will
discover your theft if you leave it open.  Anyway, that's everything
to do in this room, so go NORTH and face the receptionist.

When she asks if you speak english, type WOMAN, YES to answer her.

Then she asks for your name.  Fortunately she's willing to wait a while.
To figure out who you are (or who you want to pretend to be), try
examining everything in sight.  Specifically, X BOX (or X DESK gives
you the same description).  Hey, there's a tag in there, maybe it's for
you.  X TAG.  Then tell the woman what she wants to hear:  WOMAN, HANS
LEIBACH.

You will get that name tag (which you should wear throughout the center),
and the head of the center, Williams, shows up, and says to come see him.
But you don't want to do that yet; there's a puzzle in his office you
can't solve yet, until you've explored a little.  While you're here,
X LIST to tell you everyone's names, and ASK HENKEL (the receptionist)
about all of them.  She gives you especially useful information about John
and Stefan (namely, that Stefan is gone and you're replacing him, and that
John drinks).  Try ASK HENKEL ABOUT SPHERE to find out exactly which room
the thing is in.

Before entering the center itself, you may want to begin making a map.
This walkthrough will tell you how to get from place to place, but exploring
on your own can be fun too.

Go NORTH into the center.  To get the objects you'll need for the puzzle
in Williams' office, go WEST three times (into the kitchen).  You'll need
pretty much everything here.  GET KETTLE.  Then you'll have to hunt around
in the drawers and fridge.  OPEN UPPER DRAWER. GET GLASS.  OPEN LOWER
DRAWER.  GET KNIFE AND BOTTLE.  OPEN FRIDGE.  GET MEAT.  (X STOVE and
X WALLPAPER will get amusing messages, though it isn't really necessary.
Other messages include X MICROWAVE and USE MICROWAVE (a reference to
Lurking Horror in that one).)

(SOUTH and X CHAIRS gets you another amusing message.  I didn't find
anything else to do in the dining room.  NORTH gets you back to the kitchen.)

While you're in the neighborhood, let's get some more items that will
come in handy.  Go EAST twice from the kitchen, then SOUTH into the bathroom.
GET SOAP.  See that fusevault?  Although it is "high up on the eastern wall",
you can OPEN it.  Then GET CANDLE AND LIGHTER.  CLOSE FUSEVAULT (you may have
noticed by now that I have a "thing" about closing doors).

GETTING STEFAN'S CODE
---------------------

Since this is a walkthrough, we're going to do things in a slightly
different order than if you were just playing straight through.  You
already know (because you talked with Henkel) that Stefan is gone, so
his office is empty.  There's a useful item in there.  To get there,
head NORTH from the bathroom, EAST three times and then NORTH two more
times.  You'll be outside his office.

Try going EAST--the door is locked.  X DOOR.  You can see the bolt in
the chink...  If there were just some way to lift the bolt.  Well, there
is.  PUT KNIFE IN CHINK.  OPEN DOOR and GO EAST.

First things first: X everything you can see.  X CHAIR doesn't give you
much that's interesting.  X COMPUTER won't help; if you try to login, it
tells you to talk with Ms. Henkel about it; and if you ASK HENKEL ABOUT
LOGIN at some point, she tells you she hasn't had time to set yours up.
But it *is* possible to log into the computer, if you know some passwords
from other games.  Meanwhile, X DESK and X BASKET.  Aha, something's there.
GET PAPER and READ IT.  You may want to write down the code that's there.
It changes every game, so be sure to keep track of your saved games.  Soon
we'll find out what the code is used for.  

Right now, in fact.  Let's go check out Schwartz.  If you asked Henkel
about him, you didn't find out much; in fact, he's the head of security
for the center.  To get to his office, go WEST once, SOUTH twice, WEST
once, and SOUTH into the office.

For a security officer, Schwartz is remarkably unparanoid.  Just
X everything in his office with him sitting there, and he doesn't even
care.  Especially X DESK and X LIST.  Then, you can even GET LIST right
from under his nose.  The list tells you that there are four codes, and
that everyone in the center has one.  Except you.  ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT
CODE.  He just tells you to talk to Henkel, and we already know where
*that* got us.

ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT SPHERE, although he isn't very helpful.  But you can
see where it is: X VIDEO MONITOR.  Naturally, the one place you want to
be is the one place he's watching every second of the day.  X RECORDER
and try to play with the buttons--nope, not while he's here.  At least
he prevents you from doing *something* in his office.

GETTING JOHN'S CODE
-------------------

We've done enough here.  Finally we can go talk to Dr. Williams.  Go
NORTH once and EAST twice to his office.

If you WAIT a turn, he tells you that he wants to propose a toast, but
has no glass for you to drink out of.  GIVE GLASS TO WILLIAMS.  (You
don't actually need to wait a turn; if you don't, you really confuse
the heck out of Williams--he probably thinks you're psychic or something.)  

Then Williams starts looking around in his desk.  WAIT twice, and he'll
leave to get your forms.  Now you must spring into action--your goal is
to get *all* of his whisky.  Fortunately you brought a bunch of
containers with you.  Furthermore, you don't want him to know that
you've stolen the whisky, so you have to fool him somehow.

To be specific, you'll need to leave the brown bottle full of tea when
you walk out of here.  So GET KETTLE.  GET BROWN BOTTLE.  GET GREEN
BOTTLE. (so you don't have any awkward moments where the parser tells
you "You're not holding that")  POUR WHISKY INTO GREEN BOTTLE.  POUR
TEA INTO BROWN BOTTLE.  PUT BROWN BOTTLE ON DESK.  Finally, PUT ALL
IN BAG (so Williams won't realize what you've done).  Then you just
have to WAIT (four times) and Williams will return, you'll sign the
paper, and then you can GET GLASS and go WEST to leave.  (I'm not sure
you need the glass for anything, but it's just good practice to pick up
anything you can.)

You may as well READ DOCUMENT too; it tells you three things.

1) Schwartz is the security guy (but you knew that anyway)

2) The castle area is off-limits (not that you'll pay any attention
   to that, will you?) and

3) You need all four codes to get into the security lab.

Well, all that whisky has to come in useful somehow, so let's go get
John to talk to us.  The people wander around randomly, so you have
to go find John wherever he is.  I usually wait for him in the library
or in his office.  Once you and he are in the same room, GIVE GREEN BOTTLE
TO JOHN.

He drags you to his office and gets very drunk.  Now is your chance:
ASK JOHN ABOUT CODE.  Again, remember the number--write it down
somewhere, since it changes every game.

GETTING WILLIAMS' CODE (with some unrelated activity)
-----------------------------------------------------

So now what?  Well, since this is a walkthrough, I know that you need
something in the basement.  To get there, leave John's office by going
WEST, go NORTH twice, WEST twice, SOUTH twice, and WEST once again.

You want to go through the door to the south, but you can't because it's
locked.  Go ahead, X DOOR--notice the "door closer"?  X CLOSER.  Try OPEN
DOOR (no good).  You'll just have to wait for someone else to go through.
In particular wait for a message like "Petra puts a key in the lock...
and walks south" (when I play, it always seems to be Petra), then X DOOR
again (notice the description of the bolt... any ideas?).

If you block the bolt, the door can't lock.  So PUT SOAP IN BOLT.  Some
of it is sticking out--that won't work, Petra will notice.  CUT SOAP.
Now wait for Petra to leave.  Then go SOUTH and GET PADLOCK.  You can
X EQUIPMENT, but it isn't important.

Now we're going to head outside.  To get there, go NORTH out of the
storage room, then EAST, NORTH twice, EAST, and NORTH twice again.
You will be in the yard.

Keep going: NORTH, WEST, NORTH into the toolshed.  Only two things to
look at here: X BENCH (although it's rather pointless) and X SCOOTER
(notice the hook).  You need the scooter, and you need it someplace
else.  TURN ON SCOOTER and ENTER IT.  Then go SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH,
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHEAST and GET OFF SCOOTER and TURN IT OFF.  You'll
need to go inside the poultry house mentioned here by going NORTHWEST
and EAST.

Here the interesting object is the grating.  X GRATING, then go ahead
and try OPEN GRATING.  You'll need some leverage here.  Specifically,
TIE CHAIN TO GRATING--this wouldn't have worked without the padlock.
Then GET CHAIN and PUT CHAIN IN WINDOW (you don't even have to open
the window--it's broken).  Back to the scooter by going WEST and SOUTHEAST.

This tripped me up a bunch of times: you have to ATTACH CHAIN TO HOOK.
(Do not just type "put chain on hook", because that doesn't work,
although it sounded to me as though it did.  Anyway, use the "attach"
syntax, and you'll be fine.)  Then PUSH SCOOTER.

Let's go see what you've wrought: NORTHWEST and EAST to get inside
the poultry house, then DOWN into the hole and SOUTH.

X DOOR (it should look familiar from way back at the beginning of
the game) and X HANDLE.  You can try TURN HANDLE, but it won't do
you any good.  You don't have what you need, yet.

That's our next task.  NORTH, UP, WEST, and NORTHWEST takes you to
the center of the yard.  Continue NORTH, EAST, NORTHEAST, and
NORTH... we're getting close to the castle that you were warned
against!  READ SIGN to remind you of that very thing.  Well, tough.
Go on to the NORTH.  (X CASTLE if you want.)

You have two choices.  To begin with, go NORTHWEST.  There's a
useful item: a ladder.  GET LADDER.  Now go back to the SOUTHEAST
and try the other passage to the NORTHEAST.

Ignore the western door for now and go NORTH to the bottom of the
staircase.  (X STAIRCASE if you like.)  Go on UP to the top of the
staircase and follow the exit SOUTHWEST (X HOLES for a little
atmosphere), then WEST.

This room is a bit complicated.  You'll want to X everything in
sight again.  X SHELVES and X CUPBOARD.  Hmm... you can see all the
shelves except one.  Guess what you need to do?

PUT LADDER AGAINST SHELVES.  CLIMB LADDER.  Hey--X IRON KETTLE
(you'll have to keep calling it "iron kettle" to distinguish it
from the clay kettle, unless you drop the clay kettle somewhere).
GET that KETTLE.  Then you can go DOWN off the ladder.

Now it's time to deal with the cupboard.  Play around a bit before
you read the next part--in particular, play around until you die
a few times!

OPEN CUPBOARD.  Hey, X those UNIFORMS.  (Try to GET UNIFORMS for
an amusing message.)  Well, even though the uniforms are in there,
there's still room for you, so ENTER CUPBOARD.  Now X CUPBOARD
again.  The message is a bit different inside here.  Keep on
examining stuff.  X WALL tells you about a crack, and X CRACK tells
you about a metal plate.  X DOOR also tells you a little about the
plate.  You can open the rear wall, but I wouldn't do that yet.
(Okay, you can try it, but save your game first.)  So how could you
do that safely?  All that stuff about the plates means that only
one door can be open at a time: either the door you came through,
or the rear wall.  So first you must CLOSE DOOR, then you can
OPEN REAR WALL.  Go on out to the NORTH.

Uh-oh, a bomb!  First things first: X BOMB.  Looks like the bomb
won't go off on its own, so you have time to go ahead and X CORD,
X WIRE, and X STRAP too.  Fortunately, way back near the
beginning of the game, you picked up some wire cutters.  So CUT
RED WIRE WITH CUTTERS, and then CUT CORD WITH CUTTERS.  Yes, the
order is important.

Now that that's done, X CUPBOARD once again.  It looks different
from this angle--X PROTRUSION for a little more info, and then
X BAR for still more detail.  Might as well try to GET BAR.  It
doesn't work, but you can GET BAR again and it *does* work this
time.

That's all you need on this side of the cupboard, so SOUTH goes
back inside, OPEN DOOR (since you disabled the bomb, you can do
this without fear), SOUTH to get out of the cupboard, and don't
forget to GET LADDER before you leave.

Remember that doorway to the west that we ignored?  Let's go back
there.  EAST, NORTHEAST, DOWN, then SOUTH.  Now we can go through
that doorway to the WEST.

Interesting.  X HOLE, LOOK IN HOLE, and try going DOWN.  No good.
Fortunately, you brought a helpful item.  PUT LADDER IN HOLE.  Try
going DOWN now--*still* no good.  It's true you'll need the kettle
later, but you can leave it here for now: DROP IRON KETTLE.  Then try
DOWN (the third time's the charm).  

It's pretty clear the only way to go from here: WEST, and then NORTH.
You can X FIREPLACE and X CHIMNEY, and then go on EAST.  Here you could
X WOOD, X SHAFT, and X BASKET.  Something about this shaft reminds me
of other games I've played--you can bet you'll be using it before
you're through.  For the moment, GET WOOD and go back WEST.  PUT THE
WOOD IN THE FIREPLACE.

The game told you earlier that something was blocking the chimney.
Let's go find out what it is.  If you try to ENTER THE FIREPLACE,
you're told that you can't do it with the metal bar, so DROP BAR
and then ENTER FIREPLACE.  If you LOOK, you will see bird
droppings... Go on UP.

Aha, the source of the droppings.  X NEST and X KEY.  Go ahead and
GET KEY.  That's all you have to do here, so go DOWN and OUT.

You may have noticed a mention in passing about the soot, while you
were climbing.  X ME to see the effects of the soot.  This wouldn't
seem like a problem, but if you go back to the center this way, they'll
know where you've been, and remember: the castle is forbidden, so
you'll get in trouble.  You've got to remove the soot first.  (For
an amusing message, save the game and go back the way you are.)
There are apparently at least two different ways to clean yourself.

What we have to do is melt some snow, and use that to wash off the
soot.  What to use for a container?  The iron kettle would be nice...
We could melt it over the fire...  But we can't bring it down the
ladder normally.  There's another way to get it down, though.

First, let's go get the kettle.  Go SOUTH, EAST, and UP to where you
left it, and GET IRON KETTLE.  Now to get it downstairs.  Go EAST,
SOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, and NORTH.

You haven't been in here before.  You can X FIREPLACE and X SHAFT.
I bet you know where the other end of that shaft it.  TURN WHEEL.

Oops, you need some snow in the kettle before you get it downstairs.
Go SOUTH; the snow has been blowing around a lot, or else there's a
hole in the ceiling, because there's some snow here.  So FILL IRON
KETTLE WITH SNOW.  Then go back NORTH.  PUT IRON KETTLE IN BASKET.
You can see you aren't the first one to think of this.  TURN WHEEL
to send it back downstairs.

So let's follow it.  Go SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, WEST, DOWN,
WEST, NORTH, and finally EAST.  Whew!

To turn the snow into water, GET IRON KETTLE and take it to the
WEST.  PUT IRON KETTLE ON WOOD and make a fire: LIGHT WOOD WITH
LIGHTER.  You'll have to wait about ten turns until the wood is
consumed by the fire and you get the message "The kettle is not as
hot anymore".  Then the water will be bearable.  GET IRON KETTLE
once more and WASH ME.  (You don't have to specify "with water" or
anything like that.)  X ME to verify that the soot is gone.  And
you may as well GET BAR--you'll need it.

We're done downstairs, and in fact we're done with the castle.  Go
SOUTH, EAST, and UP.  (Notice that you can bring the iron kettle up
this way, just not down.  Hmm...)

Go on ahead out of the castle area: EAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, SOUTH,
WEST, and WEST.

Now it's time to enter the long building by going SOUTHWEST.
There's only one door you can get to at this point.  Go SOUTH and
SOUTHWEST into the Hall, and you'll hear a voice from the WEST.  Go
there.

Probably it's no surprise who you find here--who else would say
"Polly wanna cracker"?  Go ahead and X PARROT, X PACKET, X BRANCH, and
X WINDOW.  Wait around a few turns if you want, to hear the parrot say
amusing things.  I found references to Zork, Pink Floyd's The Wall,
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and some things I didn't
understand.  When you get bored with that, GET PACKET.  Finally, you
can see that this parrot repeats everything it hears, so try to ASK
PARROT ABOUT CODE.  Yep, it works.  Remember the number.

GETTING PETRA'S CODE
--------------------

One more to go.  And it's also in this building, although you can't get
there from here.  From the parrot's room, go EAST three times, then NORTH,
WEST, and SOUTHWEST.  You've gone all the way around the building.  X SOFA,
X DOOR, and finally X WINDOW.  Uh-oh, that doesn't look promising, but you
have to try.  Go ahead and OPEN WINDOW, and go EAST to get inside.  The dog
might not like you, but he didn't stop you from entering.

Now, you have something that might distract him, that you picked up way
back in the kitchen early on.  X MEAT.  We want to get the dog outside,
so THROW MEAT THROUGH WINDOW.  The dog is *almost* outside, but he just
needs a little help... PUSH DOG and he will be outside.  Quickly, go EAST
before he gets back in--you only have one turn.

In this room you can X CLOSET and OPEN IT.  X COVERALLS, GET THEM, and
WEAR THEM.  Now you can face the dog with a little protection.  Go back
WEST and X DOG.  That necklace looks interesting.  X NECKLACE.  X BOX.
OPEN BOX and GET NOTE.  READ THE NOTE and remember the number--it's the
last code!

GETTING INTO THE SECURITY LAB
-----------------------------

Time to go input the codes.  We have to get one more item first, though.
Go WEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, and SOUTH to end up in front of a storage shed.
You may as well DROP IRON KETTLE--you won't need it again, and it's from
the castle, so it would get you in trouble to take it inside.  Then
UNLOCK SHED DOOR WITH KEY (the key you went to such pains to get in
the castle) and OPEN SHED DOOR.  Go NORTHEAST to enter the shed.

X JUNK a few times for some amusing messages (including another
Hitchhiker's Guide reference).  Then X SACK.  See how it protects
against biological waste?  Wonder if it would do any good against
radiation... like beta radiation... like the kind that the sphere gives
off.  Better GET SACK.  Then we can head inside.

Go SOUTH three times, then EAST and SOUTH again.  X SMOKE DETECTOR
(although it doesn't tell you much).  Our goal is to lure Schwartz out
of his office so we can fiddle with his security camera.  Save the game
here, because the timing seems to matter in this section.  GET CIGARETTE
AND LIGHTER, then LIGHT CIGARETTE and DROP IT.  Whoa, you don't want to be
caught hanging around here.  Hightail it SOUTH, SOUTH again, WEST, and
SOUTH.  Schwartz will run into you on the way, going to turn off the
alarm, and he'll also scold you about smoking, but fortunately he doesn't
do anything more serious to you.

Now's your chance--PRESS REWIND and then PRESS PLAY.  His cameras will
only show old footage, rather than showing him you entering the door.
(If your score doesn't go up by four points, the timing was wrong and
you'll have to try again.)

I don't think there was any great rush, but there's no need to dawdle
around either.  Go NORTH and EAST.  Then go NORTH three times, WEST twice,
and SOUTH twice.  Finally, go EAST and you'll see the keypad.

Now you can type in all the codes you got: the one from the dog, the one
from Stefan's office, the one from the parrot, and the one John told you.
You can type them in any order.  Just TYPE XXX ON KEYPAD, with no quote
marks.  After all four have been correctly entered, the door will open.
Go EAST.

WINNING THE GAME
----------------

There isn't a lot of time to waste, and besides you don't need anything
else in the room.  So just GET SPHERE and PUT IT IN SACK (to protect
yourself from radiation poisoning).  Now you've got to get out of here,
so go WEST twice, NORTH twice, EAST once, and NORTH twice again to get
to the Yard outside.

SOUTHEAST, EAST, DOWN, and SOUTH brings you to that familiar-looking door.
Only, now you can open it.  That bar you have will fit over the handle.
I tried some weird phrasing here, but OPEN DOOR WITH BAR is all you need.
Go on out to the SOUTH.  (X SCOOTER and TURN ON SCOOTER for some amusing
messages.)  By now you should recognize your surroundings--go UP twice and
you're way back at the parking lot.  It should be pretty simple from here...
The aliens wanted you to bring the sphere back to the place where they
stopped your car.  So ENTER CAR, TURN ON ENGINE and go EAST.

Congratulations, you won!  If you followed this walkthrough, you should

walkthrough is provided at the end, but using it except as a last resort
will spoil your fun.

Now, to become regent you'll need to eliminate five rivals: War Minister
Klaus Wehrkeit, Christ Minister Pierre Bonfleche, Interior Minister Variola
Modo, Coffers Minister Argento Rico, and Prince Louis. Don't worry about
Ambassador to China Marco Pulisci (you can call China and find out he's
already dead).

WEHRKEIT

Wehrkeit is fighting the Venetians but soon learns of the king's death and
retreats to Piedmont. If you do nothing, he will arrive around 3 o'clock
and kill you. When you ask Miss Sierra about Venice, she will give you a
piece of information that the Venetians might be interested in and which
may threaten Wehrkeit's position. You need to contact Venice via the
telephone in the throne room. For some money, Miss Sierra will also give
you the necessary telephone codes. But you have to ask her in time, because
at some point Rico will bribe Sierra to give you a false access code which
triggers a booby trap.

Wehrkeit will still arrive and may still kill you if you run into him and
don't react quickly. But he's badly injured, and you can either kill him or
just keep away from him and wait till you get the news of his death.

BONFLECHE

Bonfleche is tutoring Prince Charles until he gets the news of the king's
death. Soon afterward he leaves for Avignon and organizes an invasion of
Piedmont by Avignese forces. He must be killed while he's still in the
palace. If you use the spying equipment in your quarters to monitor
Bonfleche's quarters, you can witness some extremely unseemly conduct on
his part at 2 o'clock. Record it with your master key and show it to Miss
Sierra. She'll take care of him.

MODO

Modo is doing experiments with green slime in an underground lab. To get to
him, you need the vials from his quarters. You don't want to go in there,
but with a hostile tone you can order the guard in. Then tell him to get
the vials. You also the need the gas mask from the royal quarters. Now go
to the fountain in the courtyard. Put the yellow liquid and then the pink
liquid in the funnel. Push the loose tile, use the gas mask, and go
down. You'll find Modo there. Kill him before he kills you. Don't forget to
pull the cord to prevent the spread of the green haze.

RICO

Rico is in his quarters most of the time. If you talk to Princess Charlotte
in the palace asylum, she will tell you about the unseemly things he's done
to her. Unfasten her straitjacket and she will follow you. Go to Rico and
give her the dagger from your quarters. (She would dispatch of Louis and
Bonfleche in the same way, but once she has killed one, she will be taken
away. Since you have other ways to eliminate Louis and Bonfleche, it's
advisable to have her kill Rico.)

LOUIS

Louis sits in the courtyard all the time. There are two balconies above the
courtyard. Prince Charles is playing with a heavy toy car in the royal
quarters. But before you can do the obvious, you have to get the car from
the prince. You have to give him something else so that he lets you take
the car. Among Rico's junk is a nice toy robot. Get it while Rico is out of
his room.


The timing is most critical in this game. You have to do everything before
the showdown with Wehrkeit, so don't lose time wandering around aimlessly.

Hints for Inside Woman by Andy Phillips
=======================================

These are in the style of an Infocom Invisiclues hint booklet.

There are however no fake questions, and everything is relevant.

Except for the prologue, the hints are categorised according to Arcology level.

Only look at the hints if a question seems relevant to a particular problem you
have, otherwise you risk confusing yourself and spoiling the game.

These are official hints by the author, but feel free to provide a step by step 
walkthrough or other alternative solution for the game if you wish to do so.


=======================

==================================
---INDUSTRIAL LEVELS (11 to 15)---
==================================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: How do I get to the industrial levels?

H1a: You can't straight away.
H1b: Don't bother until you've been to your apartment.
H1c: Have you read the guidebook? The section on ranks?
H1d: One level is accessible immediately...
H1e: ...the free market on level 13.
H1f: For the others you need a work permit.
H1g: You'll get one for level 12 eventually.
H1h: The other industrial levels are out of bounds...
H1i: ...and are not important to the game.


LEVEL 12 - AGRICULTURAL & BIODOME
---------------------------------

Q1: How do I get to level 12?

H1a: You'll know when you need to.
H1b: Don't continue unless you're a class two citizen.
H1c: You've met someone who had a task for you.
H1d: Who said to come back as a class two citizen.
H1e: Go and see Professor Zacharias. He'll issue a work permit.


Q2: I'm on level 12. Where do I go?

H2a: Remember Professor Zacharias' instructions.
H2b: You need to get the the secure area.
H2c: The biodome is to the east.
H2d: Past the security guns, USF guard and laserfence.


Q3: How do I get past the sentry guns?

H3a: Have you tried examining the cannons?
H3b: Nanci's opinion is invaluable.
H3c: The weapons have various sensors which you need to confuse.
H3d: There's a way to confuse them nearby.
H3e: You'll need various items to get through.
H3f: Hints on what to do next are given below.


Q4: How does the crop duster work?

H4a: It flies and sprays crops.
H4b: When it's switched on and has something to spray.
H4c: It can also carry a passenger.
H4d: If it was spraying something to confuse the sensors,
     you could avoid those nasty sentry cannons.
H4e: You'll need to fill the tube.
H4f: And find three more...
H4g: Extra tubes are in the hive.


Q5: I keep getting stung by the bees!

H5a: Don't open the door then.
H5b: Pity you need those tubes.
H5c: Your suit offers great body protection.
H5d: But your head is exposed.
H5e: Do you have something to cover it with?
H5f: It's a little unconventional but it'll work.
H5g: Go to the hive and wear the empty pail on your head.
H5h: Now you can open the door safely.
H5i: Just remember to close it when you're done.


Q6: I spilled all the honey when I got the plastic tubes.

H6a: Is there any way to see what you're doing?
H6b: No. There is not.
H6c: The honey isn't useful at all.
H6d: And you can't avoid spilling it.
H6e: Only the tubes are important here.


Q7: What should I do with the plastic tubes?

H7a: Have you found all four of them?
H7b: Including the one inside the crop duster?
H7c: They provide liquid for the duster to spray.
H7d: But you don't need fertiliser.
H7e: What you need is something to block the cannon's sensors.
H7f: There are four sensors, so you need four liquids.
H7g: You can fill the tubes using the compost machine in the silo.
H7h: Place a tube underneath and put something in the funnel.
H7i: Hints on what you need are given below.


Q8: What do I need to confuse the UV sensor?

H8a: Something bright and colourful would mask you.
H8b: Have you seen anything bright and colourful around?
H8c: Those berries are bright, glowing and purple.


Q9: What do I need to confuse the heat sensor?

H9a: What's the opposite of hot?
H9b: Something cool would shield you.
H9c: You don't need the compost machine for this.
H9d: Look for a cool liquid.
H9e: Water from the trough.


Q10: What do I need to confuse the radar?

H10a: Radar works on sending out waves.
H10b: Military craft use chaff to confuse radar.
H10c: Made up of tiny pieces of metal.
H10d: Is there something metallic around?
H10e: The pail is too big to fit in the machine...
H10f: ...but that handle seems loose.
H10g: Take the pail's handle.
H10h: There's your source of metal flakes.


Q11: What do I need to confuse the sniffer?

H11a: Something foul smelling would screw up this sensor.
H11b: Such stuff is often used as fertiliser.
H11c: Some er... poo would do the job.
H11d: See the hints for Q12 below.
H11e: When you've got the stuff, put it in the compost machine.


Q12: Where do I find something smelly?

H12a: Those animals in the pens are real.
H12b: And they're not wearing bodysuits to filter excrement.
H12c: The pigs need a little help.
H12d: Is there anything that could cause indigestion?
H12e: Prunes might accelerate the process.
H12f: The pigs won't touch them in solid form.
H12g: Fill a tube with prune juice, add it to the trough and voila.


Q13: I have four separate liquids. What next?

H13a: You're all set. Hop on the crop duster, insert a tube and turn it on.
H13b: You'll face four sentry cannons in a row.
H13c: Notice which sensor is active and load the spray cannon accordingly.


Q14: How do I take out the USF guard by the laserfence?

H14a: You can't unless you're close.
H14b: First concentrate on bypassing the sentry cannons - see above hints.
H14c: You can take the man by surprise.
H14d: A powerful blow would knock him out.
H14e: Like a fully grown woman dropping on him from above.
H14f: Jump on the USF guard when you're hovering above him.


Q15: How do I disable the laserfence?

H15a: Remember what happened on the landing pad at the start?
H15b: Guards carry devices to deactivate the fences.
h15c: And the man's holding such a device in his hand.


Q16: I can't get the control device.

H16a: His grip is very tight, no?
H16b: Is there anything around to cut him with?
H16c: Something very close by.
H16d: Those lasers would cut through anything.
H16e: The USF guard is too heavy to lift.
H16e: So push him into the laserfence.


Q17: I don't know the code to deactivate the fence.

H17a: The guard doesn't look that bright.
H17b: He'd need to write the code down or a clue to it.
H17c: Have you searched the guard?
H17d: You can remove part of his uniform.
H17e: Take the man's helmet.
H17f: Before you go trying it on, take a look at it.
H17g: Colour of beams. That's the clue.
H17h: Crimson is too long a word. Is there a simpler one?
H17i: The code is RED.
H17j: Set the dials from bottom to top and then press the switch.


Q18: I can't get inside the biodome.

H18a: Those guards seem very alert.
H18b: They won't let anyone through.
H18c: Except perhaps another USF trooper.
H18d: The guard's helmet can cover your face.
H18e: But your bodysuit jewels will give you away.
H18f: Have you explored the area around the biodome?
H18g: Got the pickaxe? Seen the oil fields?
H18h: Oil is black... like USF trooper jewels.
H18i: The oil is extracted and siphoned off...
H18j: ...by underground pipes.
H18k: Dig in the oil field with the pickaxe.
H18l: You'll need to hurry before the suit cleans.
H18m: And you can't carry anything into the biodome.


Q19: I'm inside the biodome. Now what?

H19a: There's evidence of an operation here.
H19b: So take the virus vial with you.


Q20: Ruby Eagle showed up! What do I do?

H20a: There's no way to avoid the encounter.
H20b: Ruby is an expert markswoman and doesn't miss her target.
H20c: You can't run or dodge the shot.
H20d: If she had another target...
H20e: ...something that was a threat...
H20f: ...she might target that instead of you.
H20g: Do you have anything suitable?
H20h: You've only had it for a minute.
H20i: Throw the vial at Ruby Eagle.


Q21: I've been contaminated with the virus!

H21a: You need to find an antidote obviously.
H21b: Except you don't have access to one.
H21c: The female scientist does.
H21d: Like Nanci says, it's either her or you.
H21e: Spies often make immoral choices.
H21f: Attack the woman and swallow the pill.
H21g: There's no way to save her without dying.


Q22: Where can I hide from Ruby Eagle?

H22a: You're trapped in the biodome.
H22b: Nanci provides important information shortly afterwards.
H22c: Ruby Eagle has X-ray vision.
H22d: So you need to shield yourself.
H22e: The locker has a radiation shield.
H22f: And the scientist opened it before she died.
H22g: So she must have a passcard.
H22h: Search the scientist's labcoat to find it.
H22i: Now you can open the locker and get inside.
H22j: By itself that won't be enough.


Q23: The wristwatch light gives me away!

H23a: It switches on in the dark.
H23b: And it's dark inside the locker.
H23c: Ruby has excellent vision.
H23d: If the blue light wasn't noticeable...
H23e: Have you looked at the control panel?
H23f: The lights in the biodome can be adjusted.
H23g: You need to know the wavelength of the wristwatch light.
H23h: The wavelength dial shows the current light in the room.
H23i: Focus on the dial to get a hint from Nanci.
H23j: If the dial was set outside the visible spectrum, it would be dark.
H23k: So turn the dial to below 380 or above 749.
H23l: Now look at the dial to get a reading.
H23m: And change the dial to that setting.


Q24: How do I avoid Ruby's thermal vision?

H24a: Have you looked at the control panel?
H24b: The temperature in the biodome can be adjusted.
H24c: If it was the same as your body temperature, you wouldn't show up.
H24d: So you need to know your temperature.
H24e: Have you looked at the thermometer and the temperature dial?
H24f: The thermometer is marked in degrees Celsius, the dial in Kelvin.
H24g: Kelvin is always the Celsius temperature plus 273.
H24h: Have you tried touching the thermometer?
H24i: Seems like a low reading. Could be the gloves.
H24j: Could you get a more accurate reading?
H24k: Think of how doctors measure body temperature.
H24l: Taste the thermometer.
H24m: Add 273 to the reading and set the temperature dial to that.


Q25: Ruby still finds me!

H25a: If she mentions seeing blue, you didn't set the wavelength dial correctly.
H25b: If she starts by saying you look hot, you didn't set the temperature correctly.
H25c: Notice that Ruby goes to the dead woman.
H25d: There's no way out of the biodome, which means you must be inside.
H25e: And the dead woman is obviously a scientist.
H25f: Her face is unrecognisable.
H25g: Ruby might mistake her for you if it wasn't obvious.
H25h: Take the woman's lab coat off her and take it with you into the locker.


Q26: I've managed to hide from Ruby Eagle. How do I defeat her?

H26a: She won't be fooled for long.
H26b: You need to surprise her, so step out of the locker straight away.
H26c: She's got you in her sights again.
H26d: As long as she can see you, there's nothing you can do.
H26e: Could you block her vision somehow?
H26f: With something large?
H26g: Throw the labcoat at her.
H26h: You have time for one action only.
H26i: Her armour protects her body.
H26j: But if you disarmed Ruby Eagle...
H26k: Grab the plasma rifle. That'll take care of her.


Q27: Ruby's dead but I've got no evidence.

H27a: You've seen the evidence. That's all that's required.
H27b: If you haven't found the evidence in the casino on level 29, go there.
H27c: Otherwise head to Utopia Studios on level 27. The gate is open now.


Q28: How do I get back past the sentry cannons?

H28a: The crop duster can't be accessed now.
H28b: But you have the means to permanently disable the cannons.
H28c: Use Ruby's plasma rifle to shoot them.
H28d: Just don't go carrying the weapon into the transporter ring.


Q29: Is there any point to visiting the biodome?

H29a: Physical evidence can't be retrieved.
H29b: But you need to discover what's going on to progress.
H29c: There's something the biodome has that'll be useful later on.
H29d: An adjustable light setting.
H29e: Something will show up in the right light.
H29f: You'll know what when you've found the clue.


LEVEL 13 - FREE MARKET
----------------------

Q1: What's the point of the swapshop?

H1a: For swapping items, obviously.
H1b: It's a one for one trade system.
H1c: You need to find something valuable to trade.
H1d: Many illegal items are valuable.
H1e: Such as cyberjacks or the morphtool.
H1f: And subbuteo pieces.
H1g: There are other things too.


Q2: Which item do I need from the swapshop?

H2a: Is there anything in particular you need?
H2b: Eventually you'll need all three items.
H2c: But one is crucial immediately.
H2d: Have you listened to the homeless man?
H2e: Remember the interface port in the guidebot?
H2f: You need the octagonal headed cyberjack.


Q3: What should I swap for the cyberjack?

H3a: You don't have many items.
H3b: The smuggler was bringing in the morphtool...
H3c: ...so it has value.
H3d: Unfortunately, you need it to open the robot's access panel.
H3e: ...which you can only do in the apartment.
H3f: Try to leave and the robot closes the panel again.
H3g: You need both the morphtool and cyberjack...
H3h: ...so you need to find something valuable.
H3i: You can find that in the retirement home on level 20.


Q4: What about the homeless man?

H4a: What about him?
H4b: Have you listened to him?
H4c: What he says is crucial.
H4d: In particular the guidebot, Jack and the quotas.
H4e: Remember the numbers -- 500 credits and 8 hours.
H4f: You'll need that information later.


Q5: I can't find Jack.

H5a: If he's a friend, he should be close by.
H5b: The man isn't talking about a person.
H5c: Remember the interface port inside the droid's panel?
H5d: The homeless man is telling you discreetly that you need something.
H5e: The octagonal headed cyberjack in the swapshop.


Q6: What about speaking Jack's language?

H6a: The man likes his cryptic riddles.
H6b: He's referring to something you need to use cyberjacks.
H6c: You have a cashcard. Have you tried buying something from him?
H6d: You need to be more discreet. Listen to the man's comments.
H6e: He keeps mentioning 'money to burn'.
H6f: Put the cashcard in the barrel.
H6g: No good? The man doesn't give nothing for free...
H6h: ...or a measly ten credits.
H6i: You need more money on your account.
H6j: You'll need to work for it.
H6k: And you can't reach the industrial levels.
H6l: But not everybody works in industry.
H6m: You can find a job on level 17, so go there.


Q7: I paid the homeless man, but he gave me nothing in return.

H7a: He's paranoid, remember?
H7b: He'll leave the item for you.
H7c: In a very safe place.
H7d: He has ways of getting places normally restricted.
H7e: Did you hear what the man said?
H7f: Go home. Chill out. Have a good rest.
H7g: Anywhere you could do those things?
H7h: The location should be obvious.
H7i: The homeless man put the item in your apartment...
H7j: ...in the cryobed.


Q8: How do I save the man in the Cards Galore store?

H8a: Looks like you got there too late.
H8b: You'll get the chance to avenge him (much) later.
H8c: The items he left behind are important.


Q9: What's the membership pass for?

H9a: Have you tried reading the pass?
H9b: It's for the Waterline Club on level 16...
H9c: ...but it won't do you much good as it stands.


Q10: What about the calendar?

H10a: It tells you the year.
H10b: But there are no important dates...
H10c: ...on the page you can see.
H10d: Remember there are twelve months in a year.
H10e: Four important dates are marked.
H10f: This information will prove valuable later.


Q11: The rusty nail is useless. Right?

H11a: Right. And wrong.
H11b: The nail itself is useless...
H11c: ...but it hides something important.
H11d: Have you tried moving the nail? Pulling it?
H11e: You need to be more forceful. Alice is pretty tough.
H11f: Don't worry about breaking a nail.


Q12: What good is the star shaped interface port?

H12a: A lot of good actually.
H12b: Have you seen anything similar?
H12c: You may not have used one yet.
H12d: It's the same idea as the octagonal port in the guidebot.
H12e: The port is for accessing cyberspace.
H12f: But you'll need a star shaped cyberjack.
H12g: You can't get one until you have access to the education levels.
H12h: Which requires you to be a class three citizen.
H12i: Which requires you to hack into the guidebot.
H12j: When you've done all that...
H12k: ...you can find what you need in the school on level 21.


Q13: What's the printing machine for?

H13a: Printing naturally.
H13b: But there's more to it...
H13c: Remember what the executive accused the store owner of?
H13d: He's a forger.
H13e: You can use the machine to forge a membership pass.


Q14: What goes in the two slots on the printing machine?

H14a: Look at the shapes.
H14b: One item can be found very close by.
H14c: The membership pass goes in the thin slot.
H14d: The second slot is circular.
H14e: Two items might work. Both are on level 25.
H14f: You can't get them until you've got access to the education levels.
H14g: A circular headed cyberjack might fit...
H14h: ...but it's not an interface port.
H14i: See the hints about helping the student on level 25 if you haven't.
H14j: The student gave you a circular item.
H14k: The datastick is what you need.


Q15: I put the items in the printing machine, but nothing happened.

H15a: Have a good look around the store.
H15b: See the above hints about the nail and interface port.
H15c: You need to do the rest in cyberspace.


Q16: I entered cyberspace. How do I get past the security door?

H16a: Have you examined the door?
H16b: The symbols?
H16c: It's a combination lock.
H16d: Notice the numbers on the dial - 101 to 1231 with some
     missing.
H16e: The numbers correspond to dates.
H16f: Where would the owner write important dates?
H16g: Look at the calendar. See the hints for level 13 if you're 
     missing something.
H16h: The four marked dates correspond to the symbols.
H16g: In order you need the wedding anniversary, Christmas Day,
     April Fool's Day and the birthday.
H16i: Turn the dial to 204, 1225, 401 and 1117 in that order.
H16j: That will unlock it.


Q17: What's the purpose of the printing press in cyberspace?

H17a: Have you seen a printer in the real world?
H17b: This is the control system.
H17c: Notice the track. You can push it along.
H17d: And turn the handle if you set the printing machine right.


Q18: I've got three printing plates, but they're all blank.

H18a: That's because you didn't provide enough information.
H18b: You need to put the correct item in the circular slot on
      the Cards Galore store machine.
H18c: See the hints above.


Q19: The handle on the printing press doesn't turn.

H19a: Something's missing from the machine in the store.
H19b: There needs to be something in the thin slot.
H19c: See the above hints.


Q20: I've got some weird stuff on the printing plates.

H20a: They're the images stored on the datastick.
H20b: The ones already on there are no good.
H20c: You'll need to take some pictures in the real world.
H20d: That requires the camera from Pete's Swapshop.


Q21: What pictures should I take?

H21a: Remember what you're trying to forge.
H21b: Did you examine the man's pass?
H21c: It has a picture on the left and an ID number on the right.
H21d: You need to substitute his details for your own.
H21e: Which means you need pictures of your face and ID number.
H21f: The first should be obvious. The second is close to home too.
H21g: Take pictures of your face and your ID tag.
H21h: What's on the third plate doesn't matter.


Q22: I've got the pictures, but don't know how to work the printing press.

H22a: Have you tried experimenting to see what happens to the pass?
H22b: Whenever you turn the handle with a plate in the press, it stamps
      that image on the corresponding side of the member pass.
H22c: You need to print the picture of your face on the left, so put the
      corresponding plate in the press, make sure the press is at the left
      hand of the track then turn the handle.
H22d: Repeat the procedure with the ID tag image on the right hand side. Push
      the press if needed.
H22e: The forged pass will get you into the Waterline Club.

---RESIDENTIAL LEVELS---
========================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: Why can't I visit all the residential levels?

H1a: You're still an immigrant.
H1b: You need to find your apartment...
H1c: ...and repair the guidebot.


Q2: How do I get out of the residential levels?

H2a: You're not restricted to just the residential levels.
H2b: Once you've repaired the guidebot, you can go to level 13 also.
H2c: But you need to go elsewhere to complete your mission.
H2d: Which means advancing to class three citizen status.


Q3: How do I advance to class three citizen status?

H3a: You need to advance to inductee status first.
H3b: Have you visited the free market?
H3c: And listened to the homeless man?
H3d: You need to work 8 hours and earn 500 credits.
H3e: Unfortunately that's impossible, though you can make a start.
H3f: The only way to proceed is to hack into the guidebot.


Q4: How do I hack into the guidebot?

H4a: You need to open its access panel.
H4b: Which you can only do when it's recharging inside the apartment.
H4c: You'll need the morphtool.
H4d: And something for the interface port - see hints for level 18.
H4e: You need both items at the same time.
H4f: And also need to 'speak Jack's language'.
H4g: More hints for these problems are in the level 13 section.
H4h: Once you've swallowed the blue capsule, you can use the cyberjack.
H4i: Provided you're wearing it on your finger.


Q5: I lost all my things when I entered cyberspace!

H5a: Have you examined yourself?
H5b: You're a cyberspace avatar.
H5c: You and your items are in the real world.
H5d: Cyberspace is completely separate.


Q6: What happened to the clock?

H6a: Have you tried waiting?
H6b: Notice what happens when you leave cyberspace?
H6c: Time stops when you're in cyberspace.


Q7: How do I get through the firewall?

H7a: Have you tried going across?
H7b: It might be a good idea to study the pattern.
H7c: You have to avoid the flames... obviously.
H7d: The flaming sequence is on a loop.
H7e: Wait until the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 8th vents flame then head north.
H7f: Sometimes you can't go forward. So stand still or move backwards.
H7g: Still stuck?
H7h: After going north: wait (1st), go north (2nd), wait (2nd),
     north (3rd), north (4th), south (3rd), north (4th), north (5th),
     wait (5th), north (6th), north (7th), south (6th), north (7th),
     north (8th), north (finish)


Q8: What should I do in the guidebot's brain?

H8a: Remember why you hacked in.
H8b: See any pattern between the numbers in the tubes and the real
     world situation?
H8c: Have you examined the tubes?
H8d: The tubes show the credits you've made (095) and the paid hours
     you worked at Luigi's (2).
H8e: You need to alter the number positions.
H8f: The requirements for advancing to class three status are 500
     credits and 8 hours -- at least.
H8g: Only one digit is large enough to satisfy the hour requirement.
H8h: Put the number 9 in the short tube.
H8i: There are two possible solutions.
H8j: But 5 must be on top in the long tube.
H8k: So change it to 502 or 520. It doesn't matter which.


Q9: I've done that. What now?

H9a: Remember the colour coding?
H9b: Class three citizens have green jewels.
H9c: Push the emerald when you're done with the tubes.
H9d: Now you can leave the residential levels.


Q10: How do I leave space?

H10a: In most cases you can leave voluntarily. Simply exit.
H10b: Damage to your avatar automatically jacks you out.
H10c: As does completing an important task.


LEVEL 16 - WATERLINE CLUB
-------------------------

Q1: How do I get into the Waterline Club?

H1a: The steel barrier is a problem.
H1b: You can only get in at certain times of day.
H1c: The club is open from 22:00 to 04:00.
H1d: But there's the problem of the bouncer.
H1e: Have you tried attacking her? Talking to her?
H1f: Looks like you need a membership pass.
H1g: There's one on level 13, in the free market.
H1h: It's in the Cards Galore shop.
H1i: Have you tried using it?
H1j: The pass is no use with another person's face and ID.
H1k: So you need to forge a pass for yourself.
H1l: Remember what the woman said in the Cards Galore shop?
H1m: The man was a forger so...
H1n: ...the equipment you need is in the shop.
H1o: See the hints for level 13 for more information.


Q2: Are the posters in the orange light district useful?

H2a: Not at first.
H2b: The times are important though.
H2c: They're not of use until you've gotten into the club.
H2d: Remember the meeting protocol?
H2e: You need to hear blue. Is there a time you could do that?
H2f: The blues hour is from 01:00 to 01:59.


Q3: I've gotten into the Waterline Club. Now what?

H3a: Have you tried exploring?
H3b: Have you noticed the posters outside?
H3c: And the Agave bottle? And the dance floor?
H3d: There's a lot of blue stuff around.
H3e: Remember Nanci's comment when you entered?
H3f: About touching, hearing, tasting, and seeing blue?
H3g: This is the meeting point for the resistance.
H3h: Appropriate hints for each part are below.


Q4: How do I touch blue?

H4a: You don't need to touch it with your hands.
H4b: But you do need to be in contact with something blue.
H4c: The Ocean is blue.
H4d: The closest thing in the club is the dance floor, so go there.


Q5: How do I see blue?

H5a: You need to touch blue first. See the hints above.
H5b: Have you looked at things on the dance floor?
H5c: The stage lights? One is broken. Could that help?
H5d: Remember what happens when you're in darkness.
H5e: The watch will activate its blue light.
H5f: So you need to stand in a dark place.
H5g: Stand underneath the broken stage light.


Q6: How do I hear blue?

H6a: You can hear something in the club.
H6b: The music...
H6c: ...but it's so bad listening won't do any good.
H6d: If only you knew what was playing.
H6e: The posters outside the club give the information.
H6f: See the hints for Q2 if you haven't done so.
H6g: You can only meet the contact between 01:00 and 01:59.


Q7: How do I taste blue?

H7a: You need something blue to eat or drink, obviously.
H7b: The capsule you bought was blue...
H7c: ...but you already used that. Is there something else?
H7d: The bottle of blue Agave.
H7e: Drink that at the appropriate place and time, and 
     the contact will show up.


Q8: I can't open the bottle of Blue Agave.

H8a: Simple. Open the top.
H8b: Except it's stuck. Have you looked at the shape?
H8c: Small and square, like a bolt.
H8d: You need a tool to loosen it...
H8e: ...like a wrench.
H8f: Or the morphtool.


Q9: My contact gave me this air freshener. What now?

H9a: Remember what Nanci said. You need to smell blue.
H9b: Have you examined the air freshener?
H9c: Spray that and you'll smell blue.
H9d: But you need to do it in a specific place.
H9e: Remember what the contact said...
H9f: Go freshen up was a hint.
H9g: There's a place for freshening up in the club.
H9h: The washroom.
H9i: Try spraying the air freshener in there.
H9j: You need a specific target.
H9k: Try spraying the mirror.


Q10: I keep getting captured in the Waterline Club.

H10a: You've been caught blue handed, so to speak.
H10b: There's no way out, and you only have time for one action.
H10c: You need to remove the incriminating evidence.
H10d: Clean the mirror before the USF show up.
H10e: If you need to see the message, you can spray the mirror again
      after they leave.


Q11: How do I rescue the contact?

H11a: You can't. She's on her own.
H11b: But remember the choker the executive wears. And the whip she has.
H11c: It's useful for another puzzle.


Q12: What does the cryptic blue message mean?

H12a: You have a name - Zacharias.
H12b: All the twos. Is there anything it could refer to?
H12c: Could be a time...
H12d: ...or a place.
H12e: Actually it's both. Find the place first.
H12f: Have you tried going to level 2?
H12g: Guess not. Any other level that fits the description?
H12h: The library on level 22. That's where to go next.


LEVEL 17 - CAFETERIA & MESS HALL
--------------------------------

Q1: What's the carrier bag for?

H1a: Um... carrying things.
H1b: A lot of things.
H1c: An unlimited number of things, which is handy.


Q2: Is there anything to buy at the food outlets?

H2a: Not unless you have money.
H2b: You should have found the cashcard in your apartment.
H2c: If you have more than 10 credits, don't waste them here.
H2d: The items in the vending machine are too expensive...
H2e: ...and so are the pizzas.
H2f: But there's one cheap store around.
H2g: You can buy a prawn cracker from Cheap Faux Chinese for 10 credits.


Q3: What use is the prawn cracker?

H3a: You can't judge everything by its looks.
H3b: Try eating it.
H3c: No good? What would you do if you were served terrible food?
H3d: Take the cracker back to the serving woman and show it her.


Q4: I don't see the point of returning the food.

H4a: Have you tried complaining to the serving woman?
H4b: Do you really think you could better than her?
H4c: Well do you?
H4d: Being polite isn't always the best course of action.
H4e: Show the serving woman the cracker then answer yes.
H4f: Now you have somewhere else to go.


Q5: What's the purpose of the Luigi's Pizza restaurant?

H5a: To serve pizza of course.
H5b: And not very good from the look of things.
H5c: There's a menu outside though...
H5d: ...which you'll need later on.
H5e: The owner is around for the evening shift (18:00-00:00).
H5f: But he's not much help unless you need him.
H5g: Deal with Cheap Faux Chinese first (see the above hints).
H5h: Don't continue until you know of an opportunity.
H5i: Ask Luigi about the job. He'll tell you to come back
     at 22:00 either today or tomorrow (depending on the time).


Q6: I've got a job. Now what?

H6a: Luigi gave you the instructions.
H6b: Be at Luigi's at the time and day he specified.
H6c: If you're late, don't worry. You'll get another chance.


Q7: What should I do in the kitchen?

H7a: What do you think?
H7b: Get cooking Alice!
H7c: The assistant gives you the instructions after a minute or two.
H7d: You need to cook a pizza, serve a drink and print out a bill.
H7e: Put all three items on the serving bot's tray.
H7f: And you need to do this three times to get paid.


Q8: How do I cook a pizza?

H8a: You've got the ingredients.
H8b: And the pizza base.
H8c: Put the required ingredients on the base then the pizza in the oven.
H8d: Keep a close eye on it. You don't want it overcooked...
H8e: ...or undercooked.
H8f: Cooking a pizza takes around 10 minutes.
H8g: Time is limited, so start the pizza first in each order,
     and deal with the other stuff later.


Q9: How do I complete the first order?

H9a: The customer wanted a Corny Chick pizza and lemonade.
H9b: You'll need the printed menu.
H9c: Corny Chick requires chicken and sweetcorn, so cook that.
H9d: And dispense a lemonade from the drinks machine.
H9e: Add up the price on the menu. The bill comes to 30 credits.
H9f: Put everything on the tray, and you should get another order.


Q10: I screwed up in the kitchen!

H10a: If you make a mistake and realise it, you can throw the unwanted
      item (pizza, bill or drink) into the trash receptacle.
H10b: If Luigi kicks you out, listen to what he says.
H10c: Getting the order wrong means the pizza or drink was wrong.
H10d: Not being able to do basic math means the bill was for the wrong price.
H10e: Don't worry. Luigi is the forgiving type, so you get as many 
      chances as you want.


Q11: How do I complete the second order?

H11a: The customer is a vegeterian and wants at least two toppings.
H11b: But you can't serve them just anything.
H11c: It needs to be a priced item on the menu.
H11d: Mama's Garden is the pizza you want.
H11e: So add mushrooms, onions and sweetcorn to the base then cook it.
H11f: Dispense a coffee and print out the bill for 30 credits.
H11g: When you're done, put everything on the tray.


Q12: What's the pizza for the third order?

H12a: The customer ordered a special.
H12b: Did you see the board outside the restaurant?
H12c: The special is either Feasty Meaty, Mama's Garden or Fiery Luigi.
H12d: They revolve on a three day cycle.
H12e: Make a note of which before you enter the kitchen.


Q13: The kitchen drinks machine doesn't dispense cola!

H13a: Have you tried operating the machine?
H13b: It's out of cola...
H13c: ...and there's none in the kitchen.
H13d: Have you seen anything else that might dispense cola?
H13e: It's on the same level.
H13f: The vending machine dispenses soft drinks.
H13g: But you have no money.
H13h: Who says you have to pay?
H13i: Give the vending machine a good thump.
H13j: When you enter the kitchen, take the Tricola with you.
H13k: Now open the can, then pour the cola in the empty cup.
H13l: If you screw up and use the can, the vending machine has 
      more cola.


Q14: I'm getting the pricing wrong on the third order.

H14a: Have you added up the prices for the pizza and soft drink?
H14b: Remember the customer ordered a special.
H14c: Read the menu again, especially the last line.
H14d: Ordering a special means the drink is free...
H14e: So charge the customer for the pizza only.


Q15: After all that I finally got paid. What should I do with the money?

H15a: Have you been to the 'free' market on level 13?
H15b: Listen to the homeless man if you haven't done so.
H15c: He has something for you now you have extra capital.
H15d: See the hints for the Free Market level for what to do next.


LEVEL 18 - STANDARD APARTMENTS
------------------------------

Q1: I made it to the apartment level. Where should I go?

H1a: All the exits from the transporter ring lead south.
H1b: Gone there?
H1c: You were assigned a guide, so follow it.
H1d: Head south after the guidebot.


Q2: The guidebot broke down. What next?

H2a: You can't rely on the guidebot for help then.
H2b: Obviously you need to find your apartment.
H2c: Have you tried wandering around? The layout is logical.
H2d: But it would help to know where you were.
H2e: Luckily there are signs to help.
H2f: Nanci's opinion on the signs is useful.
H2g: Have you noticed the other citizens? They have ID tags.
H2h: And so do you.
H2i: Try moving and seeing how the tag numbers correspond to the
     street intersections, sublevel and door numbers.
H2j: The first letter corresponds to the sublevel: (D)esert,
     (F)orest, (Ice), (M)ountain, (O)cean or (S)pace. Try moving
     up or down.
H2k: The second letter and first two numbers correspond to the
     street interection. Change the letter by moving north or
     south, and the number by moving east or west.
H2l: The last two numbers help identify the door.


Q3: I think I've found my apartment door. How do I get in?

H3a: Have you examined the door?
H3b: Palmprints were scanned before arrival.
H3c: You can press the pad to get the door open.


Q4: I'm in my apartment. What now?

H4a: Try looking around.
H4b: At everything.
H4c: The storage drawer is a good starting place.


Q5: Is there anything useful in the citizen's guidebook?

H5a: Have you tried examining it?
H5b: Reading it?
H5c: Looking at the sections?
H5d: All the sections contain crucial information.


Q6: What's the cashcard for?

H6a: Nothing groundbreaking.
H6b: It's for paying with. You'll need it soon enough.


Q7: What's the digital wristwatch for?

H7a: Telling the time.
H7b: Not working? Try wearing it.
H7c: Timing is crucial for certain events.
H7d: The watch has another interesting feature...
H7e: ...which you'll learn by examining it.
H7f: The water provides light in the dark.
H7g: This will help and hinder you as the game progresses.
H7h: And like the bodysuit, you can't remove the watch.


Q8: What's the cryobed for?

H8a: Have you examined the cryobed?
H8b: It's for sleeping in, but you'll need to set a time first.
H8c: Find and wear the wristwatch first.
H8d: Now you can sleep until a desired time of day.
H8e: Using the cryobed has no adverse effect.
H8f: And it's the quickest way to pass time.


Q9: Is there anything special about the cryobed?

H9a: Have you tried switching it on without getting inside?
H9b: It's a real pain to have to wait for it to deactivate.
H9c: So there must be a shutoff feature.
H9d: Examine the bed closely.
H9e: It's on elevated legs which means...
H9f: ...there's a space underneath.
H9g: Try looking under the bed. There's the stop button.


Q10: I can't get off level 18!

H10a: Have you tried returning to the transporter tube?
H10b: You can't go anywhere interesting.
H10c: The guidebook has some important information.
H10d: You need to advance to inductee status.
H10e: And that requires a working guidebot.


Q11: How do I open the guidebot's access panel?

H11a: Have you examined the guidebot?
H11b: Looks like you need a wrench.
H11c: Except there isn't one in the game.
H11d: You've already got the tool you need.
H11e: But you may not know it yet.
H11f: You need to discover the purpose of the inhaler...
H11g: ...and find out more about what's inside.
H11h: The hints for level 35 will help you do this.
h11i: After that, the next step is simple?


Q12: What's the fried component?

H12a: Have you examined it?
H12b: Nanci's very technical minded.
H12c: The item is a burned out power cell.
H12d: And you need to replace it.
H12e: The fried component itself is useless.


Q13: What's the purpose of the octagonal interface port?

H13a: Have you tried inserting the morphtool?
H13b: That doesn't work here.
H13c: The port is no use for repairing the guidebot...
H13d: ...but it will be useful later.
H13e: Don't continue until you've repaired the guidebot.
H13f: And visited the free market on level 13.
H13g: There's something there that would fit.
H13h: It's an interface for the octagonal headed cyberjack
      (found in Pete's Swapshop).


Q14: I need a spare power cell. Where do I find one?

H14a: There's one in your apartment.
H14b: Try looking around.
H14c: Something in there has power beside the cryobed.
H14d: Have you tried switching off the light?
H14e: You'll need to find an alternate source of illumination.
H14f: Try reading the hints for the storage drawer items.
H14g: When you're wearing the wristwatch, you can remove the
      bulb when the light is switched off.


Q15: How do I get the power cell from the light bulb?

H15a: Have you tried being forceful?
H15b: Nanci's opinion is useful, so focus on the bulb.
H15c: An extreme change in conditions would weaken the glass.
H15d: Is there any way you could do that?
H15e: Something extremely cold?
H15f: Put the bulb in the cryobed and set the bed to a future time.
H15g: But the cryobed warms up steadily, so the change in conditions isn't
      sudden enough.
H15h: An emergency stop would do it.
H15i: If you haven't found the stop button, see the hints for Q9 above.
H15j: Press the button with the bulb inside the active cryobed.
H15k: Now the lightbulb is weak enough to break.


Q16: How do I repair the guidebot?

H16a: You need to get the access panel open.
H16b: Remove the bad part and insert a replacement.
H16c: The hints on how to do these things are above.


Q17: The guidebot is active. What now?

H17a: Did you listen to the guidebot?
H17b: Your suit jewels changed colour.
H17c: Meaning five new levels are open to exploration.
H17d: Namely the other residential levels (16, 17, 19 and 20) and the
      free market (level 13). Hints for these areas are given elsewhere.


LEVEL 19 - LUXURY APARTMENTS
----------------------------

Q1: I can't go anywhere on level 19.

H1a: Do you class yourself as a luxury?
H1b: Utopia Technologies don't.
H1c: Unless you have reason to visit the luxury apartments, you can't.
H1d: And you won't have a reason until late in the game.
H1e: When you reach class one citizen status, this level can be explored
     further.


Q2: What are the statues for at Lucy Song's estate?

H2a: Have you looked at them?
H2b: They're lights for the garden. And they'll save your life later on.
H2c: And they're voice activated.
H2d: So you need to figure out the words to turn them on.
H2e: What do the statues represent?
H2f: Lucy Song likes ordering her team mates around.
H2g: Try saying the names of Utopia Freedom players.
H2h: Their first names.
H2i: There are ten in total - the same names as the subbuteo pieces.


Q3: Does Lucy Song have a safe?

H3a: Yes she does.
H3b: And you'll need to get into it.
H3c: The safe is in Lucy's trophy room.
H3d: Have you looked at the memorial stand?
H3e: There's a sensor, and the correct object is the 'key'.


Q4: What's missing in the trophy room?

H4a: Some modesty perhaps.
H4b: And an item for the memorial stand.
H4c: Something to symbolise the Chinese women's soccer team.
H4d: If you haven't found the UTN news article, try solving this later.
H4e: The symbol of the team is a steel rose.
H4f: You can find one among other roses.
H4g: And where somebody sculpts steel.
H4h: It's in the retirement home.
H4i: Try searching the flowers in the arboretum.


Q5: What should I do with the subbuteo table?

H5a: Play with it.
H5b: No time for games? Try examining the table.
H5c: The items that go on it should be obvious.
H5d: You need to place the pieces in their correct positions.
H5e: Do that and Lucy Song will have a message for you.


Q6: How many subbuteo pieces are there?

H6a: How many players are there on a soccer team?
H6b: Don't forget to include the coach too.
H6c: Alternatively, look at the subbuteo table.
H6d: There are twelve spaces, so you need twelve pieces.


Q7: Where do I find all the subbuteo pieces?

H7a: Lucy Song gave most of them away.
H7b: Quite a few ended up with her resistance contacts.
H7c: Utopia Freedom supporters often have one.
H7d: Others you'll have seen already in your travels.
H7e: Do you really want to know where they all are?
H7f: Here is a list of pieces and locations (alphabetical order) with
     level in parantheses.
     See hints for the appropriate level if you're stuck finding or
     acquiring one.

  Rachel Baker		- Zacharias' safety deposit box (32)
  Monika Berlin 	- collection plate, Holy Citadel (24)
  Wendi Miranda Donahue - Old Bruce (20)
  Anya Kaparov		- student in Chill Zone (25)

  Lucy Song		- Lucy Song's safe (19)
  Ehizoge Symons	- school trophy cabinet (20)


Q8: I have all the subbuteo pieces. Where exactly do they go?

H8a: There are three separate clues to help.
H8b: You should have found one with the Rachel Baker piece.
H8c: And received another when you got the piece from Old Bruce.
H8d: Following up on this will get you a third (and most important) clue.
H8e: Wendi Miranda Donahue wrote a book.
H8f: Where do you find books?
H8g: Get the book from the library and read it. The UTN news article will help.
H8h: Wendi Miranda Donahue was the coach, so put her on the C position.
H8i: Information from the message cube and UTN news article is vital.
H8j: Place the numbers you know first, starting with numbers 7, 8 and 9.
H8k: The rest can be deduced. Remember Zacharias had numbers 4 and 5.
H8l: Are you still stuck?
H8m: Here is the lineup:

  Wendi Miranda Donahue (C)	Anya Kaparov (6)
  Monika Berlin (1)		Janie Rourke (7)
  Zara McCoy (2)		Sian O'Hara (8)
  Ehizoge Symons(3)		Lucy Song (9)
  Kelly Price (4)		Natalia (10)
  Rachel Baker (5)		Tania Rourke (11)


Q9: I know Lucy Song's secret. What next?

H9a: There's a bomb about to explode.
H9b: And you know where it is.
H9c: A million will die if you don't do something.
H9d: What are you standing around for?
H9e: Unfortunately, things aren't quite that simple.


Q10: Help! I'm drowning!

H10a: You need to escape obviously.
H10b: Taken by surprise, your air supply is limited.
H10c: You need to get more oxygen...
H10d: ...and find a way out of the pool.
H10e: See the hints below.


Q11: How do I get extra air underwater?

H11a: There are no oxygen tanks.
H11b: And you can't breathe underwater.
H11c: But Pearl Crocodile can.
H11d: Is their any way to tap her air supply?
H11e: Your life's at stake! Anything goes.
H11f: Kiss Pearl to suck the air from her mouth.
H11g: This will only work once. 


Q12: How do I escape from Pearl Crocodile?

H12a: You need to weaken her grip.
H12b: Struggling won't help.
H12c: Look around.
H12d: Especially at the body in the net.
H12e: And what Pearl's carrying.
H12f: She's concentrating on drowing you, so grab the harpoon.
H12g: Pearl won't let you use it against her.
H12h: But you could target something else. You need to be quick.
H12i: Have you looked at the body?
H12j: There's a weapon you can pick up if you get close enough.
H12k: The harpoon has a cable and winch.
H12l: Not scared of a little blood are you?
H12m: Shoot the body with the harpoon.
H12n: Then get the pistol and use it on Pearl.


Q13: I got out of the pool but Pearl Crocodile is still after me!

H13a: Maybe it's a good idea to run.
H13b: Then again, maybe not.
H13c: She'll soon recover. Get rid of her.
H13d: Look around for something to use.
H13e: Something you didn't have earlier.
H13f: Have you examined the wheelchair?
H13g: Those wires could be nasty if they were exposed.
H13h: Pull the wires.
H13i: You have a power source, so use it.
H13j: Push the wheelchair into the swimming pool.


Q14: I'm under attack from an invisible woman!

H14a: Remember the incident in the holding cell?
H14b: The invisible woman is Crystal Mole.
H14c: You need to avoid her attacks and find some means to see her.
H14d: More hints are below.


Q15: How do I avoid Crystal Mole?

H15a: She'll spend some time toying with you.
H15b: Eventually Crystal will attack.
H15c: You can't see her... yet.
H15d: But there's another way to find out where she is.
H15e: You can hear footsteps.
H15f: Listen and you'll know which direction she's coming from.
H15g: Attack in that direction and you'll hit her.
H15h: This strategy won't work forever, but it will buy you time.


Q16: How can I see Crystal Mole?

H16a: She's invisible.
H16b: But her optical camouflage isn't perfect.
H16c: If there was enough light you could see a distortion.
H16d: You may have already turned on a light here.
H16e: To get enough light, you need to activate all ten statues.
H16f: See the hints for Q2 if you're stuck.


Q17: I've made Crystal Mole visible. Now what?

H17a: For the first time you're on equal terms.
H17b: Don't squander your opportunity.
H17c: Take her out. A simple attack will do the job.
H17d: Having dealt with the two executives, you can continue.


Q18: Time's running out. How do I get to the stadium?

H18a: Have you tried leaving the estate?
H18b: The USF are after you. For some reason they're not concerned
      -- or don't know -- about the bomb.
H18c: Sneaking past them is difficult...
H18d: ...unless you were invisible.
H18e: You can take the optical camouflage from Crystal Mole.
H18f: Wear it and you can dodge the guards.
H18g: The stadium's on level 30.


LEVEL 20 - RETIREMENT HOME
--------------------------

Q1: What's the objective here?

H1a: Exploration to start with.
H1b: Eventually you'll get a task to complete.
H1c: You have to visit this level more than once.


Q2: How do I get inside outside visiting hours?

H2a: There's no way in when the barrier is closed.
H2b: Honestly. You'll have to come back some other time.


Q3: What's with the receptionists?

H3a: Their job is to provide information.
H3b: Notice the they -- there are two of them.
H3c: They can answer questions you have about the retirement home.
H3d: The key they're guarding seems important, doesn't it?
H3e: Knowing what happens around midday will be crucial later.


Q4: How do I get the sculpture from the activity area?

H4a: That's Old Bruce's pride and joy.
H4b: He won't let you take it.
H4c: Unless you have a good reason.
H4d: You need to get Old Bruce to cooperate.


Q4: Old Bruce keeps grumbling.

H4a: Have you listened to what he says?
H4b: Try asking the receptionist about Old Bruce.
H4c: You need to pay attention to Old Bruce... or listen.


Q5: What's the point of completing Old Bruce's task?

H5a: Don't you want to help an old man?
H5b: He'll reward you...
H5c: ...with a valuable item you need.
H5d: So find a way to get the sculpture to the plinth.


Q6: I can't get past the wrought iron gate in the arboretum.

H6a: It's locked.
H6b: You've already seen the key. The receptionist will confirm 
     it unlocks the gate.
H6c: But you can't get it without an item from beyond the gate.
H6d: Sounds like a paradox...
H6e: ...but there's another way past the gate.
H6f: Try examining the gate for a subtle clue.
H6g: You can climb over the gate.


Q7: I can't get the steel sculpture through the gate.

H7a: Climbing doesn't work if you're holding something heavy.
H7b: For this you do need the key.
H7c: An item from the flooded garden will help.
H7d: See the hints below.


Q8: Is there anything of interest in the flooded garden?

H8a: There's a collapsed walkway.
H8b: And two other items of interest.
H8c: Both in the same place.
H8d: Most stuff here is flooded.
H8e: You solved a similar problem in the registration area.
H8f: Search the water. 
H8g: Twice.
H8h: You can't use the cable right away, but you'll need it later.


Q9: What's the magnetic gun for?

H9a: Careful around USF troops. That's an illegal item.
H9b: It only works on magnetic things - iron, steel, cobalt etc.
H9c: Have you tried it on the gate?
H9d: What about the prongkey?
H9e: Neither of those is the solution.
H9f: There's something else made of metal in the home.
H9g: Look around the lobby.
H9h: The grandfather clock has an iron pendulum.
H9i: So shoot it. Those extra two minutes are crucial.


Q10: I've interfered with the grandfather clock. Now what?

H10a: The clock is two minutes fast.
H10b: Does anything time dependent happen in the lobby?
H10c: Have you read the shifts section of the citizen's guidebook?
H10d: Or been in the lobby at around 12:00?
H10e: A shift change occurs at noon.
H10f: And now the morning receptionist leaves two minutes early.
H10g: Giving you just enough time to grab the gate key and run off.


Q11: I can't carry the steel sculpture across the walkway.

H11a: The walkway's too slippery to cross with something so large.
H11b: If only you could raise it.
H11c: There's a cable in the same place you found the magnetic gun.
H11d: But you can't hold the cable and cross the walkway at the same time.
H11e: If there was something to support the cable...
H11f: ...or someone.
H11g: Old Bruce would help.
H11h: He's restricted to a wheelchair.
H11i: But it has wheels, so you can push him around.
H11j: Push Old Bruce to the flooded garden and give him the cable to hold.
H11k: You know what to do next: place the sculpture on the island's plinth.


Q12: What's the silver pyramid for?

H12a: Are you ungrateful?
H12b: It certainly looks valuable.
H13c: Have you been to the free market on level 13?
H13d: You can trade the pyramid for something at Pete's swapshop.
H13e: The pyramid has another use...
H13f: ...but you won't discover it until much later in the game.


Q13: I get captured and arrested in the flooded garden.

H13a: You're not supposed to be there.
H13b: Remember Old Bruce's warning.
H13c: Don't get caught after closing time.


Q14: Is there anything else of interest in the retirement home?

H14a: There's an item you may have missed.
H14b: You won't need it until much later on.
H14c: There's something in the arboretum.
H14d: Hidden in the flowers.
H14e: A painted steel rose.


Q15: Does Old Bruce have any more information?

H15a: Not immediately.
H15b: Much later on you'll get a hint he knows something important.
H15c: Don't continue unless you've found the message cube.
H15d: Seems Old Bruce knew Lucy Song.
H15e: And may have a subbuteo piece.
H15f: Have you tried asking Old Bruce about Lucy?
H15g: He'll deny knowing her unless you show him proof.
H15h: Play the message cube for him.
H15i: He'll give you a subbuteo piece...
H15j: ...and some valuable information.
H15k: What he says about Wendi's biography is important.
H15l: Finding that book could be a big help, so try the library.
H15m: Old Bruce will answer any questions about Lucy now too.


======================

H5c: Have you noticed how the boy copies you?
H5d: Is there any action you could perform that he'd copy and give you the key?

H10d: She's carrying a pen.
H10e: Notice anything familiar about the patterns of squares?
H10f: Gemma's standing on a crossword puzzle.
H10g: Have Gemma move around and explore the grid.
H10h: She needs to fill in the white squares. The questions are posted
      on the first square (across or down), and the letters go left to
      right (for across) or top to bottom (for down). Gemma can write
      individual letters on each square.
H10i: All the answers are common knowledge to Arcology Citizens.
H10j: Really -- you can figure them out.
H10k: The answers are:
	Utopian police abbreviation - USF

H12b: He's expecting you to do something.
H12c: Rescue the boy.


Q13: How do I deal with the school bully?

H13b: He'll soon realise he's met his match and do the coward's thing.
H13c: You need to stop him.
H13d: He's too quick to catch, so you need to slow him down.
H13e: Read the paragraph very carefully.

H15e: Throw the piece through the window.


Q16: I can't get my stuff back through the arched window!

H16a: This is very similar to another puzzle on this level.
H16b: Alice needs her hands free to climb up.
H16c: Is there any way to get the stuff inside before going through?
H16d: Throw the stuff through the arched window.


LEVEL 22 - GREAT LIBRARY OF UTOPIA
----------------------------------

Q1: What book do I ask the droid for?

H1a: Books are catalogued by surname and title.
H1b: Unless you know any last names, you won't find anything.
H1c: There are two books you can find.
H1d: Don't bother trying unless you've found the message on Level 16.
H1e: Remember the message? All the twos - that was a hint to come to the library.
H1f: Remember the other part? Look for Zacharias.
H1g: Ask the droid to find Zacharias - you'll get a book.


Q2: I keep dying when opening Zacharias' book. What do I do?

H2a: Try reading the cover.
H2b: Do you see anything important before you die?
H2c: The cover mentions time being critical - and it is.
H2d: You need to open the book at a certain time.
H2e: The message of level 16 is the clue here.
H2f: What time is all the twos?
H2g: Open the book at 22:22


Q3: What are the yellow contact lenses for?

H3a: Have you read the description?
H3b: Have you focused on them to get Nanci's verdict?
H3c: The lenses store retinal data and can be used to bypass a scanner.
H3d: They're also illegal, so use the inhaler to transport them between levels.


Q4: What about the second book?

H4a: The second book becomes available much later.
H4b: If you're not a purple (class one) citizen, you don't need it yet.
H4c: If you haven't found the message cube, don't continue.
H4d: If you haven't spoken to Old Bruce, do so.
H4e: He mentioned a name and a biography - follow up on it.
H4f: The second author is Wendi Miranda Donahue. 


Q5: What is the purpose of the reading room?

H5a: It should be self-explanatory.
H5b: Reading. Room. What do those words imply?
H5c: It's for reading library books - and is the only place you can do so.
 

LEVEL 23 - MUSEUM OF UTOPIAN ACHIEVEMENT
----------------------------------------

Q1: How can I get past the USF troops west of the entrance?

H1a: They're quite adamant on not letting you past.
H1b: They'll only let you through with the Director's permission.
H1c: If you haven't met the Director in person, you can't get through.
H1d: When you have class one citizen status, you can go west. Until then, no.


Q2: How do I get the Janie Rourke subbuteo piece out of the exhibit hall?

H2a: Have you tried taking the piece out?
H2b: The guard doesn't seem that alert, does he?
H2c: But he can still hear the alarm, and see you with the piece.
H2d: He doesn't have much regard for the alarm system, so you could confuse him.
H2e: Have you tried putting something on the pedestal?
H2f: It'll need to be similar enough to fool the guard.
H2g: Only one item will work -- something that looks exactly the same.
     Another subbuteo piece, identical to Janie Rourke.
H2h: If you've far into the game and have found the UTN news article, you'll know
     a key fact about two players. But you can make a guess anyway.
H2i: Janie Rourke has a twin sister named Tania.
H2j: Don't carry on until you have the Tania Rourke piece. 
     It's somewhere in the school on level 21.
H2k: Put the Tania Rourke piece on the pedestal, hide the Janie piece, and you can leave.


Q3: I've got the subbuteo piece out of the hall, but can't take it out of the museum.

H3a: There's no way to fool this guard...
H3b: ...which means you'll have to deactivate the security.
H3c: You'll need to get past the USF troops (see Q1).
H3d: Examining and having Nanci analyse the museum security will help.
H3e: You need to remove the radiation from the Janie piece so it won't be detected.
H3f: And that means using the deradiator.


Q4: How do I work the deradiator?

H4a: What deradiator? It'll be obvious when you've find it.
H4b: Don't continue unless you've gotten past the USF troops (see Q1).
H4c: Reading the instruction manual is always useful.
     Or in this case, the sign.
H4d: You need to know the donator and the year of donation.
H4e: Who's been giving away subbuteo pieces recently?
H4f: If you've found the subbuteo table or message cube, you'll know the answer.
H4g: Lucy Song was the donator, so the initials are LS.
H4h: She's been giving the items away recently, so you can assume it's the current year.
H4i: The year was mentioned on the terminal early on. And the calendar.
H4j: The current year is 2165.
H4k: Set the rings to LS2165, put the piece on the deradiator and activate it.
H4l: Now you should be able to safely remove it from the museum.


Q5: What's the purpose of the time capsule?

H5a: It's a ride, so get in.
H5b: It provides useful historical background...
H5c: ...and something very interesting in the last room (the archipelago).
H5d: If you haven't helped the student in the cafeteria on level 25, you may
     not realise its significance.
H5e: The Arcology will do for one of his photos.
H5f: Unfortunately you can't take photos from inside the time capsule.
H5g: See the hints for Q7 below.


Q6: How do I get through the emergency exit?

H6a: If you're on the wrong side you can't open it.
H6b: It's an exit so there must be an entrance.
H6c: You'll be able to open it from the other side.


Q7: Is there any more I can do with the time capsule?

H7a: There's not much you can do from inside.
H7b: You need to get out. Is there a safe area to do that?
H7c: Try jumping into the water in San Francisco.
H7d: Ah, the safety harness...
H7e: You can't unlock the harness when it's closed.
H7f: So you need to prevent it locking in place.
H7g: Have you examined the harness?
H7h: If you could block the buckle...
H7i: Put something small in the buckle before you set off. You
     can get the item back later.


Q8: What should I do in San Francisco?

H8a: There's not much you can do from the air.
H8b: See the above hints if you want to escape the capsule.
H8c: There's something new you can see from the water.
H8d: A vent in the west wall. You need to reach it, which involves
     solving a few problems first.


Q9: There's not much to see in San Francisco.

H9a: There's Coit Tower...
H9b: ...and the maglev rail. And the ocean.
H9c: Most of San Francisco is underwater.
H9d: Try diving. 
H9e: That valve looks useful. Turn it to lower the water level.


Q10: I've found the bridge. What now?

H10a: You're not here for sightseeing.
H11b: That cable could prove useful.
H11c: Do you care for Utopia or history?
H11d: Break the bridge to get a useful item.
H11e: That won't help by itself.
H11f: And don't stop there.
H11g: Break it again.


Q11: How do I reach the vent in the west wall?

H11a: Don't continue unless you've lowered the water level.
H11b: And got two useful items.
H11c: Have you tried throwing the cable at the vent?
H11d: If you had something to tie the cable to, it might catch.
H11e: Like the support pillar.
H11f: Looks like that's not the answer.
H11g: Is there something better to hook on to?
H11h: Try throwing the cable and pillar at the maglev rail.
H11i: Now you have a cable to climb.
H11j: Can't reach it? How can you get closer?
H11k: Turn the water valve and try again.
H11l: You can't go up... or west.
H11m: You need to gain some momentum. Is there anything around you
      could push off?
H11n: Kick Coit Tower and then go through the vent.


Q12: I keep on dying in the Colombian trenches!

H12a: Apparently Utopia used real poison gas.
H12b: Looking before you leap is a good idea.
      Try examining the soldiers and the trenches from the time capsule.
H12c: Or if you didn't, have a good feel around.
H12d: The soldiers must have survived the gas somehow.
H12e: You'll need to be specific when searching.
H12f: Feel their heads. Or take a gas mask if you know about it.
H12g: Now you can breathe down here.


Q13: How do I clear the smoke?

H13a: That'd be helpful wouldn't it?
H13b: Unfortunately you can't.
H13c: You can't see a thing, so rely on your other senses.


Q14: Where do I go in the trenches?

H14a: Did you look at the trenches before jumping in?
H14b: It's a bit of a maze, but a very small one.
H14c: The entrance is in the southeast, the exit in the northeast.
H14d: Move around and make a mental or written note where the walls are.
H14e: The maze is a five by five grid with no complications -- going 
      west then east will get you back where you started etc.
H14f: You can only move in the major compass directions.
H14g: If you're still stuck, go W W W N N E N N W W W from the entrance.


Q15: So what was the point of all that?

H14a: Reaching the Arcology, naturally.
H14b: And the other side of the fire exit. Now you can come back anytime.
H14c: Go help the student in the cafeteria on level 25 if you haven't done so.
H14d: He needs a photo of the arcology for his portfolio.


LEVEL 24 - HOLY CITADEL
-----------------------

Q1: What are the Tenets of Utopia for?

H1a: Reading.
H1b: Really. They'll save your life some day (very soon, in fact).
H1c: You'll need to learn the lines.


Q2: How do I get into the Citadel?

H2a: Have you read the note on the door?
H2b: You'll have plenty of opportunities.
H2c: Be there on the stroke of the hour.


Q3: I keep getting killed during the ceremony!

H3a: Ruby is eagle eyed and will spot anything out of place.
H3b: You can't hide -- at least not while she's watching.
H3c: What does the minister say?
H3d: They're reciting the tenets.
H3e: He starts you off so...
H3f: ...you need to finish them.
H3g: The Tenets of Utopia are posted outside the Citadel.
H3h: In response to the first line, say they were unworthy  
H3i: Then in turn:   They shall all perish
                     For we are superior
                     He is our saviour
                     Long live the director


Q4: What should I do with the collection plate?

H4a: What would you normally do?
H4b: Taking the subbuteo piece with Ruby watching is a bad idea.
H4c: You need to donate something.
H4d: Any item will do, but getting it back could be problematic.
H4e: Best put something useless on the plate, like the fried component.
H4f: Or the cashcard (now useless) 
     or another subbuteo piece (not needed for a while).
H4g: You'll get the chance to get the item back (and the Monika Berlin piece) later.


Q5: I'm still getting killed in the ceremony!

H5a: What did you do last time?
H5b: That won't help since you don't know the words.
H5c: Nanci's comment provides a subtle clue.
H5d: You need to hide.
H5e: The citizens are about to bow. There's your opportunity.
H5f: Ducking won't work, since you'll still be in sight of the citizens.
H5g: Is there anything you could do while ducked you couldn't before?
H5h: Take a look at what's around? Any hiding places?
H5i: Hide under one of the pews.


Q6: What's the statue of the Director for?

H6a: For information and looking at what a great man he is.
H6b: Have you spoken to the student on level 25?
H6c: Have you helped him with his problem?
H6d: He needs a picture of the Director.
H6e: Unfortunately you can't get it during the ceremony.
H6f: Concentrate on surviving then deal with this later.


Q7: The statue disappeared! How do I get it back?

H7a: The statue only officially comes up during the ceremony.
H7b: Remember what the minister was doing before the statue raised?
H7c: Remember what he said? Focusing on the statue and Bible might help.
H7d: Cometh the year, cometh the day, cometh the moment.
H7e: Have you looked at the bible?
H7f: You need to turn it to three specific places.
H7g: The clues are on the door outside. If you need to get of the hall,
     check the appropriate hint below.
H7h: The Director was born on the extra day at a quarter to four in the
     afternoon in the year 1916.
H7i: Start with the year, so turn the bible to 19:16
H7j: What's the extra day? It comes every four years.
H7k: You'll need to enter it in American format, putting the month first.
H7l: In a leap year, the extra day is February 29th, so turn the bible 
     to 2:29.
H7m: Then the moment. Use military time format.
H7n: The time is 15:45.


Q8: What should I do with the minister?

H8a: Nothing unless you want to.
H8b: He may be worth following.
H8c: You'll need to hide in the room or leave before he goes to bed.
H8d: Hiding may give you an extra clue.
H8e: If you're not carrying anything, you can get on the chandelier.


Q9: How do I get the items on the collection plate?

H9a: Have you tried taking them?
H9b: You'll need to deactivate the forcefield.
H9c: The stained glass window is the answer.
H9d: Do those women remind you of anybody? You've met at least one by now
     and heard of another.
H9e: The animals and colours are important.
H9f: There are six women, so you need to press six animals.
H9g: If you're quick and hide, you can see the last animal the minister pushes.
H9h: This puzzle is easier to solve later when you know the executives better.
H9i: Some you won't have met the first time you're in the citadel, and you'll 
     get more opportunities to meet them later.
H9j: The women have distinctive features, so try to remember which one is which.
H9k: The first woman was the executive in the tetrahedron -- Ruby Eagle.
H9l: So start by pushing the red eagle.
H9m: From left to right, the women are Ruby Eagle, Jet Scorpion, Crystal Mole,
     Ivory Worm, Amber Bear and Pearl Crocodile.
H9n: The symbols you need to push are: red eagle, black scorpion, clear mole,
        white worm, orange bear and grey crocodile.


Q10: How do I get out of the citadel?

H10a: You used the same solution to another problem.
H10b: If the citizens and minister return, they'll see you.
H10c: Hide under a pew again.
H10d: You can come in and out as often as you need to, and
      don't have to repeat the ceremony.


Q11: I keep getting discovered by the minister!

H11a: Don't let him see you.
H11b: See the hints to Q10 if you haven't already.
H11c: If he notices something out of place, he'll raise the alarm.
H11d: The Director's statue is very large. If it's still up, turn the bible to
      a random page to lower it.
H11e: Also, don't leave anything lying around.



LEVEL 25 - UNIVERSITY OF UTOPIA
-------------------------------

Q1: Where do I go on campus?

H1a: Have you looked around?
H1b: Have you seen the holomap?
H1c: Depending on where you've been, maybe that's not much help.
H1d: There's somewhere much closer and in immediate sight.
H1e: The cafeteria.
H1f: It's open during the evening shift (18:00-24:00).


Q2: How can I help the student in the Chill Zone?

H2a: Have you tried listening to him?
H2b: Try asking him about the computer.
H2c: Follow up questions can give you valuable information.
H2d: Have you looked at the computer?
H2e: A copper circle. Have you seen something like it before?
H2f: It requires a cyberjack, but the one you have is no good.
H2g: Hanging around the student long enough might help.
H2h: He has the cyberjack, but it won't work for him.
H2i: Ask the student for the circular headed cyberjack.
H2j: Well -- what are you waiting for? Jack in.


Q3: What should I do about the dragon?

H3a: Have you tried defending yourself?
H3b: Looks like that's not an option...
H3c: You can't do anything about it the first time...
H3d: ...but you need to get rid of the problem.
H3e: Notice what the student says when you exit.
H3f: He's interested in what happened.
H3g: So tell him about the dragon.
H3h: Next time you log on, you'll be better equipped.
H3i: Try looking at your inventory in cyberspace.
H3j: It's a throwing star, so throw it. Bye bye dragon.


Q4: How do I unscramble the text?

H4a: Have you tried reading the text?
H4b: Have you tried turning the spinners? Both of them?
H4c: They need to be set to specific letters.
H4d: Whenever you turn the white spinner, the text changes,
     replacing the yellow spinner letters in the text.
H4e: This is a standard substitution cipher, with each letter of the
     alphabet being replaced by another. If a letter occurs more than
     once, the substitution is the same each time.
H4f: Identifying likely words in the coded message helps.
H4g: Try talking to the student if you're stuck. Ask him some questions.
H4h: Does he mention a name? A signature?
H4i: Ivory Worm. That's at the end, so try changing the letters.
     With those in, a couple of more words can be guessed.
H4j: It's common to try putting THE or YOU in the text for unknown
     three letter words, so try that.
H4k: Remember where you are, and who Ivory Worm is.
H4l: The text is: 
     YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THE EXECUTIVE OF CYBERSPACE -- IVORY WORM


Q5: I've unscrambled the data. What now?

H5a: The student seems pleased, but he's got another problem.
H5b: He asked you a question.
H5c: Offer to help by saying yes. He'll give you a task and
     something to help.
H5d: This is the only way of getting class two citizenship.
H5e: You'll need a camera. You've probably seen one already.
H5f: There's a camera in Pete's Swapshop on Level 13.


Q6: Where do I find the photos?

H6a: First you'll need something to take the pictures with.
H6b: Got that? Good.
H6c: You can find a map, but not the real Director...
H6d: ...and you're already inside the arcology.
H6e: All the pictures can be found in the Education Levels.
H6f: Try exploring a little.
H6g: The Director's Statue is in the Citadel on Level 24.
H6h: The Arcology model will do -- that's on Level 23 in the museum.
H6i: See the hints for the appropriate level for these photos.
H6j: You can find a map on Level 25. Not the holomap, a different one.
H6k: You'll need to make contact in the Waterline Club first, so follow
     the hints from there. Read Q8 below if you're still stuck after that.


Q7: Does the student have anything else of value?

H7a: Have you seen what he's wearing?
H7b: Have you noticed a series of similar items around?
H7c: Try asking the student about the Freedom.
H7d: He has a subbuteo piece of Anya Kaparov.
H7e: He'll only give it to you after you've helped.
H7f: Fix the computer, get the photos and then ask him for the piece.


Q8: Is there anywhere else to go on campus?

H8a: There's the cafeteria for a start.
H8b: Besides that? It's too easy to get lost without a map.
H8c: Fortunately you have one.
H8d: If you have a particular department in mind, you can find it.
H8e: Don't continue unless you've found Professor Zacharias' book.
H8f: Seems like a useful man to find.
H8g: He's in the economics department, so look that up.
H8h: Head off to the south.


Q9: How do I get past the retinal scanner?

H9a: Have you tried looking in the scanner?
H9b: It was worth a shot. Presumably you have the book by Professor Z.
H9c: The key is opening the book.
H9d: Try reading the hints for the library on level 22 to do that.
H9e: The next step should be obvious.
H9f: Wear the lenses and look in the scanner.


Q10: What can I do in Professor Zacharias' office?

H10a: Not much to start with.
H10b: Try listening to the professor.
H10c: He won't let you touch anything in his office, so your options are limited.
H10d: But you can look around. See anything useful?
H10e: Look at the map more closely.
H10f: It shows the economy and Utopia corporations. Need that for anything?
H10g: Take a picture. It'll do for the student's portfolio.
H10h: You can't do anything more until you have class two citizen status.
H10i: And still not much more until you've completed Zacharias' tasks.


Q11: I've got class two citizen status. What now?

H11a: What did the professor say?
H11b: It might be worth a second visit.
H11c: In fact, it's essential.
H11d: The professor gives you a new task.
H11e: Notice he gave you a work permit. 
      Try visiting the other levels Zacharias mentioned.


Q12: When do I come back to see Zacharias?

H12a: Have you tried re-entering his office?
H12b: After visiting him as a class two citizen?
H12c: Seems he doesn't want to be disturbed.
H12d: Come back after you've finished the set tasks.
H12e: In fact, there'll be another reason for coming back later.


Q13: How do I avoid being captured by the executives?

H13a: You can't. Go to Zacharias' office after completing all his
      tasks and you'll be arrested.
H13b: Once you're captured, time becomes critical.
H13c: You may want to complete other miscellaneous tasks first.
H13d: But you'll need to get captured eventually.


Q14: Professor Zacharias is no longer in his office. What can I find?

H14a: The first time he's not there some rather nasty women are.
H14b: After that, you can take a look around.
H14c: Remember what Zacharias said before he died?
H14d: About breaking legs?
H14e: See any legs to break?
H14f: Break the two table legs - you'll find some useful items.


Q15: What's the pentagon headed cyberjack for?

H15a: For putting in a pentagon shaped hole, obviously.
H15b: It must be somewhere where Zacharias has access.
H15c: Remember the features of the other interface ports?
H15d: They were all copper rimmed. See any copper around?
H15e: Try looking at the map.
H15f: What to look for should be obvious, since you have the jack.
H15g: Look for a pentagon on the map -- there's your access port.


Q16: I'm in cyberspace. What are these pyramids for?

H16a: Have you looked at them all?
H16b: There are five in total.
H16c: One of them has extra information.
H16d: A number and a message.
H16e: There are four digits in the number, and five pyramids.
H16f: The purpose is more clear when you've been to level 32.
H16g: This is where Zacharias stored important information.
H16h: The pyramids are crucial to obtaining the security codes 
      for Zacharias' safety deposit box at the bank.


Q17: What does the message on the copper pyramid mean?

H17a: It says start with a number. That's the first security code.
H17b: The next part says go clockwise.
H17c: The order the pyramids come in is important.
H17d: And connecting to the order of the codes.
H17e: Starting there and going clockwise, the pyramids are copper,
      glass, sandstone, red and silver.


Q18: Some of these pyramids look familiar.

H18a: You've seen at least two already: silver and glass.
H18b: Out in the real world.


Q19: There's only one number in cyberspace. Where are the other
     four codes?

H19a: Zacharias wouldn't store them all in one place.
H19b: You'll need to look for the pyramids elsewhere.


Q20: Where's the glass pyramid (second) security code?

H20a: Look at the pyramid closely.
H20b: A woman on a motorcycle. Remember that?
H20c: The pyramid is the roof of the game zone.
H20d: There's only one room to search.
H20e: Any numbers on the videogame?
H20f: The code is hidden in the high score table.
H20g: The high score for Mother Nature is the second security code.


Q21: Where's the sandstone pyramid (third) security code?

H21a: Look at the pyramid closely.
H21b: It's a real place.
H21c: The base is a hint.
H21d: Seen anything that glows yellow?
H21e: Jack out of cyberspace and you'll be right next to it.
H21f: The code is hidden on the map in Zacharias' office.
H21g: See the hints at the end for more advice.


Q22: Where's the red pyramid (fourth) security code?

H22a: The pyramid looks unearthly doesn't it?
H22b: It's not on Earth.
H22c: Actually this one is on Mars...
H22d: ...in cyberspace.
H22e: Zacharias had an important item on him when he died.
H22f: Go to the morgue on level 31, get the ticket and follow
      the trail from there.


Q23: Where's the silver pyramid (fifth) security code?

H23a: You've already seen a silver pyramid...
H23b: ...but the code is usually invisible.
H23c: You need to retrieve the pyramid given to you by
      Old Bruce if you don't have it.
H23d: Notice the shaft of purple light.
H23e: That's telling you the pyramid needs to be in purple light.
H23f: There's only one place where the light is purple.
H23g: You may need to change the wavelength.
H23h: Go to the biodome on level 12, change the wavelength to 
      violet (380-449) and look at the pyramid again.
H23i: The number is the fifth security code.


Q24: Does the map in the office have a hidden purpose?

H24a: There are two important things about the map.
H24b: You'll need to be alone in the office to discover them.
H24c: Find the items in the office if you haven't already.
H24d: Look at the hints for Q15 first.
H24e: See the hints below.


Q25: How do I read the map?

H25a: Read the hints for Q16 if you haven't done so.
H25b: There's more to the map than an access port.
H25c: Notice how the map glows. You can make it brighter.
H25d: You can't control the map brightness but...
H25e: Turn off the desk lamp. That should brighten things up.
H25f: Notice anything about the map colour?
H25g: Try wearing the lenses then looking again.
H25h: There are grid references on the map.


Q26: What do I look for on the map?

H26a: You can look up specific places.
H26b: If you haven't visited the pentagon, don't read any further.
H26c: Remember the stone pyramid? It's a real place.
H26d: Find Giza -- the map reference is the third security code.


=======================
---RECREATION LEVELS---
=======================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: How do I reach the recreation levels?

H1a: You need to gain access to the residential and education levels first.
H1b: After that, concentrate on getting class two citizen status.
H1c: The university on level 25 is a good place to start.


LEVEL 26 - TRAVEL AGENT
-----------------------

Q1: The conductor won't let me do anything!

H1a: You can't bargain with the robot.
H1b: Or destroy it.
H1c: Or outsmart it.
H1d: So you need a ticket.
H1e: You'll find one in plain sight later on...
H1f: ...when you have access to the administration levels.
H1g: It's in the morgue on level 31.


Q2: I got a ticket. Now what?

H2a: Hand it to the conductor.
H2b: The rest should be obvious.
H2c: Take a seat and enjoy the trip.


Q3: What is there to see on the red planet?

H3a: There are some nice canyons.
H3b: And a red pyramid.
H3c: Seen anything like it before?
H3d: You may want to check out Zacharias' office throughly.
H3e: Zacharias' fourth security code is hidden here.


Q4: Where is the security code hidden?

H4a: Have you examined everything in sight?
H4b: The pyramid?
H4c: The canyons?
H4d: The latter seems to have a pattern. Maybe if you had a better view.
H4e: Climb the pyramid and try looking at the canyons again.


Q5: I can't see the canyons because off the sun.

H5a: You need to shield your eyes.
H5b: Astronauts deal with this situation a lot.
H5c: There's a visor on your spacesuit.
H5d: And a control to lower it.
H5e: But your head is inflexible inside the helmet.
H5f: So you can't see the back and side.
H5g: You've had to find things you couldn't see before.
H5h: Feel the spacesuit then turn the knob.
H5i: Now look at the canyons from atop the pyramid.
H5j: The number you see is the fourth security code.


LEVEL 27 - UTOPIA STUDIOS 
-------------------------

Q1: The studio gates are locked.

H1a: Have you looked at the gates?
H1b: Tried forcing your way through?
H1c: There's no way inside the studios. Yet.
H1d: You'll need to come back later.
H1e: If you haven't done so, go see Professor Zacharias to 
     get additional instructions.
H1f: Visit the other two areas he mentioned.
H1g: The biodome is on level 12, and the casino on level 29.
H1h: Complete your missions there.
H1i: Then the studio gates will be open.


Q2: I'm going to be a movie star!

H2a: Good for you.
H2b: But it's only a B-vid.
H2c: And you're not here to enjoy yourself.
H2d: Like Nanci said, you'll only get one shot.
H2e: And you only have ten minutes to get ready.
H2f: So ditch what you're carrying and put on the costume.
H2g: Don't forget the holopistol.
H2h: You'll get your items back later.


Q3: What am I supposed to do with the script?

H3a: What do you think?
H3b: Examine it. Read it.
H3c: You need more specific information.
H3d: Remember what the producer said?
H3e: You're playing Chinese Soldier #143.
H3f: So try finding that part in the script.
H3g: It would be unprofessional to take the script with you.
H3h: You'll need to memorise the part.


Q4: I keep getting kicked off the movie set.

H4a: You do know what you're doing?
H4b: Read the script if you didn't.
H4c: And more than a cursory glance is required.
H4d: See the hints for Q3 if you haven't.
H4e: The rest is all about acting.
H4f: Everything Chinese Soldier #143 does is important.
H4g: You must perform the actions correctly, and in sequence.


Q5: What are my lines?

H5a: You have read the script?
H5b: Your specific part? See the hints for Q3 and Q4.
H5c: Your character doesn't say much. Only three words.
H5d: But there's a lot of action.
H5e: The first instruction is to shoot the zombies, so do that.
H5f: The weapon has already jammed, so the next step is...
H5g: Throw the gun at a zombie.
H5h: Next you have to say something.
H5i: Say I'm out.
H5j: Got the hang of it now? The rest is all action.
H5k: Climb onto a zombie, jump up and grab the gun.
H5l: Still struggling?
H5m: Shoot the zombie. Break the crawling zombie's neck.
H5n: All you have to do is scream. Then fall into the hole.
H5o: Whew!


Q6: I've done my bit. Now what?

H6a: They're still shooting the movie.
H6b: But you're not on camera any more.
H6c: You need to find a way backstage.
H6d: Dressing up as a zombie may confuse the crew.
H6e: And there's one in the hole beside you.


Q7: Why's Nanci acting strange?

H7a: It does seem rather odd.
H7b: You have more important things to worry about now.
H7c: You'll find out why soon enough.


Q8: How do I get a zombie uniform?

H8a: Have you tried taking the one from the robot.
H8b: Colombian uniforms are a different colour to the Chinese.
H8c: So the one you're wearing is no good.
H8d: Unless you disguise it somehow.
H8e: Look at the Colombian uniform. Read the description.
H8f: It's covered in mud.
H8g: So take your uniform off, drop it in the mud, and put it back on.
H9h: Now your body looks like a zombie.


Q9: How do I get the zombie's mask?

H9a: That would be useful.
H9b: Have you tried taking the mask?
H9c: It might be easier to get if the zombie lost its head.
H9d: Fortunately you have the means to do that.
H9e: What happened on the movie set?
H9f: Try shooting the zombie's head.
H9g: Not working? Remember how holopistol's work.
H9h: The robots are light sensitive.
H9i: And this one's covered in mud.
H9j: Try cleaning its head first, then shoot it.
H9k: Now you can get the mask.


Q10: I'm wearing the uniform and mask, but keep getting caught.

H10a: Did you disguise the uniform? See the hints for Q8.
H10b: Read the text carefully.
H10c: Holding the pistol gives you away.
H10d: So drop the gun. It's useless.


Q11: I made it backstage to the prop room. Now what?

H11a: Did you hear what Nanci said?
H11b: That box looks important. Examine it.
H11c: You need a hexagonal headed cyberjack.
H11d: Luckily there's one around.
H11e: Search the storage shelves.


Q12: This looks like a trap to me.

H12a: Well spotted.
H12b: But sometimes you need to spring a trap.
H12c: So jack into the black box.


Q13: I'm in cyberspace. This place looks familiar.

H13a: It should. You've been there before.
H13b: Appears everything was a deception.
H13c: Ivory Worm has you in a trap. You need to escape.


Q14: How do I escape from cyberspace?

H14a: Have you tried jacking out?
H14b: It won't be that easy.
H14c: Listen to what Ivory says before the scenario restarts.
H14d: You need to find a bug in cyberspace.
H14e: Is there anything that could take place out of sequence?
H14f: Doing what you're supposed to won't help.
H14g: You need to change the order things happen.
H14h: Not much happens you can interact with.
H14i: The only actions involve the Nanci pill.
H14j: You're supposed to take it then eat it.
H14k: But who says you have to follow orders?
H14l: If you tried to eat the pill before taking it...
H14m: Remember you want things to be out of sequence.
H14n: So insist on doing it that way around.


Q15: I escaped Ivory Worm's trap. What now?

H15a: Aren't you angry?
H15b: Just a little.
H15c: You don't want to lose the element of surprise.
H15d: Attack Ivory Worm before she can react.


Q16: Where's Nanci gone?

H16a: Did you pay attention to what just happened?
H16b: Ivory Worm didn't lie.
H16c: Nanci's gone for good. You're on your own.


Q17: How do I get out of the prop room?

H17a: Have you tried leaving through the door?
H17b: You need a different strategy.
H17c: There's no way to avoid being found.
H17d: If the crew man sees Ivory's body, it won't be good.
H17e: You need to hide her.
H17f: How did you conceal yourself?
H17g: Dress Ivory up as a zombie. Put the uniform and mask on her.
H17h: But she still looks suspicious lying on the floor.
H17i: Move her body to where the other robots are.
H17j: Drag Ivory Worm onto the shelf.


Q18: How do I get back into the film studio?

H18a: You were lucky to escape before.
H18b: And you got all your stuff back.
H18c: There's no need for a second visit.


Q19: I've done everything here. Where do I go next?

H19a: Ivory Worm's revelations were startling.
H19b: You're not the only one in danger.
H19c: Better check on Professor Zacharias.
H19d: Be warned. Timing is about to get critical.


LEVEL 28 - GAME ZONE
--------------------

Q1: I can't go anywhere on level 28.

H1a: Utopia likes its rules and procedures.
H1b: You need a permit to play games.
H1c: You'll get one when you need it.
H1d: Ironically you'll need to play and win games to get it.
H1e: A casino attendant on level 29 has a permit.
H1f: She'll give it to you after you beat the casino games.


Q2: I'm inside the game zone. What now?

H2a: Have you looked at the superbike?
H2b: You'd look cool riding that.
H2c: So get on and start the engine.


Q3: What happened to my score?

H3a: You're playing a game. Remember?
H3b: A game within a game.
H3c: While you're on the superbike, the score is the videogame score.


Q4: What's the maximum possible score on the videogame?

H4a: Lucy Song is a very good player.
H4b: She scored close to the maximum.
H4c: The maximum possible score is 4000 points.


Q5: How many points do I need to score in the videogame?

H5a: In a game it's advisable to score as many points as possible.
H5b: The woman in the casino gave some instructions.
H5c: You need 2000 points to see the manager.
H5d: But there's a bonus for scoring 4000.
H5e: A very important bonus.
H5f: You'll get a subbuteo piece.
H5g: Which you need to finish the game.
H5h: In other words, you need 4000 points.


Q6: This videogame is hard. How many tries do I get?

H6a: What makes you think there's a limit?
H6b: You play as often as you want.
H6c: And may have to in order to learn the best strategy.


Q7: Any general advice for playing the videogame?

H7a: Try it a few times to get a feel for it.
H7b: You gain points by causing destruction.
H7c: Do as much damage as possible.
H7d: Big explosions and stunts are a staple of the genre.
H7e: Pulling those off will earn you more points.


Q8: What should I do in the showroom?

H8a: Don't worry about the guards. They're poor shots.
H8b: This is an action game. Cause as much damage as possible.
H8c: Shooting those goons would be a start.
H8d: Did you examine the guards? There's a subtle hint.
H8e: Drive into the guards and run them over for some more points.
H8f: Notice those motorbikes? Blow them up!


Q9: I've wrecked the showroom. How do I escape?

H9a: There's an obvious escape route if you look.
H9b: The windows here are breakable.
H9c: You're a superspy in a videogame...
H9d: ...which means stunts are the norm.
H9e: Drive through the window.


Q10: I'm being pursued by a helicopter on the roof!

H10a: You don't have time for gawping here.
H10b: You won't reach the door while you're under fire.
H10c: So find a way to gain more time.
H10d: If the helicopter pilot couldn't see so well, they might miss.
H10e: Most of the helicopter is armoured.
H10f: But the searchlight isn't, so shoot it.
H10g: You're about to crash into that door!
H10h: You need to target a specific weak point.
H10i: Shoot the lock off.


Q11: How do I avoid the guards in the stairwell?

H11a: It's a bottleneck.
H11b: Even low level goons are decent shots in tight spaces.
H11c: Unless they couldn't see you.
H11d: Try looking at what you see.
H11e: Dry ice makes white clouds.
H11f: Shoot the fire extinguishers.


Q12: I'm trapped in the stairwell and can't escape.

H12a: You need to even the odds. See the hints for Q11 first.
H12b: A shootout with the goons is a bad idea.
H12c: You could run them over.
H12d: That's not the best solution however.
H12e: Do what you do best. Blow something up.
H12f: Read the text about the guards carefully.
H12g: They're carrying something explosive.
H12h: Shoot the grenades.


Q13: I've got a sedan on my tail!

H13a: Don't worry. It'll lose you eventually.
H13b: You score points for getting rid of it though.
H13c: The vehicle is armoured.
H13d: Look for a weak spot.
H13e: Shoot the tires.


Q14: I've got motorbikes on my tail!

H14a: You can shoot them to earn a few points.
H14b: There's a better solution however.
H14c: Notice the tanker truck?
H14d: Look at it closely.
H14e: Shoot the valve to create an oil slick.


Q15: There's a roadblock ahead! What now?

H15a: Are you going to let it stop you?
H15b: Shoot something obviously.
H15c: Killing the snipers will get you some points.
H15d: But there's a better way to deal with them.
H15e: Notice what they're standing under.
H15f: Shoot the holoboard.
H15g: You could go around the truck...
H15h: ...but you're a superspy and do stunts.
H15i: Slide underneath the truck for extra points.


Q16: That helicopter is back!

H16a: This is the big boss. You can't get rid of it that easily.
H16b: You'll need to do something about those cannons.
H16c: What do you normally do?
H16d: Shoot the cannons.
H16e: The helicopter has a backup plan however.
H16f: Its missiles require you to be in sight.
H16g: Anywhere to hide?
H16h: Go underneath the awnings.


Q17: HOw do I destroy the helicopter?

H17a: Concentrate on avoiding it first. See the hints above.
H17b: A solution will present itself.
H17c: Notice that ramp? It's not there for show.
H17d: Ride on the ramp.
H17e: In the air? See anything to target?
H17f: Shoot the rotor blades.


Q18: Can I have a list of available points for the videogame?

H18a: Only look at this if you're totally stuck and the above hints
      don't help.
H18b: Still here?
H18c: Here's the list of points and actions you need for a maximum
      score of 4000.
        
        100  Shooting the showroom guards
        200  Running over showroom guards
        200  Destroying the showroom motorcycles
	300  Driving through showroom window
        250  Taking out the helicopter searchlight
         50  Shooting off the padlock
        100  Smoking the stairwell (shoot fire extinguishers)
        250  Shooting a fission grenade in the stairwell
        300  Shooting the sedan's tires
        400  Flooding the road with oil (shoot tanker valve)
        300  Shooting the holoboard
        400  Sliding underneath the truck
        300  Destroying the helicopter's cannons
        150  Driving under the awnings
        200  Driving up the ramp
        500  Shooting the helicopter rotor blades
             (and finishing the videogame)

      These are non-ideal solutions and won't earn you the maximum
      score.

    	100  Riding over the men in the stairwell
         25  Taking out a pursuing motorcycle (can be repeated)
        100  Destroying the oil tanker
        100  Shooting the roadblock snipers


Q19: I've beaten the videogame. Is there anything more to do here?

H19a: Do? No. Look at? Possibly.
H19b: Don't continue unless you've searched Zacharias' office.
H19c: And jacked into his cyberspace port.
H19d: The glass pyramid here resembles the one in the pentagon.
H19e: See any numbers around?
H19f: Try playing the game.
H19g: Look at the high scores very carefully.
H19h: One of them is by Mother Nature. That's the second security code.


LEVEL 29 - FAME AND FORTUNE CASINO
----------------------------------

Q1: I don't like gambling.

H1a: You have little choice.
H1b: But you won't be playing for money.
H1c: Or spending anything.


Q2: How do I get upstairs?

H2a: Have you tried going up?
H2b: Did you listen to the attendant?
H2c: You need to prove yourself worthy.
H2d: There are three games you need to win.
H2e: Win the Lucky Dip, Wheel of Fate and the Lottery.
H2f: Don't worry about getting caught cheating. That's a good thing.


Q3: How do I win the Lucky Dip?

H3a: Have you tried playing.
H3b: Despite the name, you can't win through luck alone.
H3c: You need to know the number you pick in advance.
H3d: Have you looked at the balls?
H3e: The blue text?
H3f: Got anything you could substitute?
H3g: Your wristwatch would do the trick.
H3h: It only works when its really dark.
H3i: What provides light in the tank?
H3j: Any way you could cover the lamp up? You don't have much.
H3k: Cover the lamp with a metal ball. Then show the woman the watch.
H3l: Give the attendant a number to match the time you'll show her.
H3m: Timing is crucial here. Try again if you don't get it.
H3n: And the balls are numbered 1 to 800 so you can only do this
     before 08:00.


Q4: How do I win the Wheel of Fate?

H4a: Play it a couple of times to see what happens.
H4b: You can't rely on luck.
H4c: Have you tried deliberately turning the wheel to a gold segment?
H4d: You need to know how fast the wheel turns.
H4e: It moves too quickly to see.
H4f: Judgment is blind, like the attendant says.
H4g: The wheel's making a real racket.
H4h: Listen while the wheel is turning.
H4i: Now you can make it land on the gold segment.
H4j: But you'll need to be specific when you turn it.


Q5: How do I win the Utopian Lottery?

H5a: It's a real lottery.
H5b: But the odds are much better if you know the secret.
H5c: Have you tried saving, restoring and watching a draw again?
H5d: The numbers follow a set sequence.
H5e: But saving and restoring won't work because the attendant will 
     test you.
H5f: Watch several draws in a row and make a note of the numbers.
H5g: There's a pattern the numbers follow.
H5h: More specifically, three patterns.
H5i: Meagan in the arcade room has a hint. Ask her about the lottery.
H5j: One of the numbers is always prime.
H5k: That number follows the sequence of prime numbers between 1 and 50:
     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
H5l: One number is a multiple of 10, decreasing each time:
     50, 40, 30, 20, 10
H5m: The last number is a square number, increasing in sequence:
     1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49
H5n: None of the numbers overlap. At the end of each sequence the number
     starts again from the beginning.
H5o: Based on the last three lottery numbers, you can work out the next three.


Q6: Is Meagan good for anything?

H6a: You can ask her questions.
H6b: She won't help you with the mission in the casino.
H6c: Apart from giving a couple of hints.
H6d: She has something else you need.
H6e: Look at Meagan's clothes.
H6f: Ask her about the Freedom.
H6g: She has the Zara McCoy subbuteo piece.


Q7: How do I play the trivia game?

H7a: Have you examined the machine?
H7b: No tokens? You'll have to borrow one.
H7c: From someone close by.
H7d: Meagan has a lot of tokens to play with.
H7e: Try asking her for one.
H7f: You'll have to take her up on the offer.
H7g: Tell Meagan to put a token in the trivia machine.


Q8: Meagan always beats me! It's not fair.

H8a: The quiz questions are the same each time.
H8b: But four are chosen at random from a set of eight.
H8c: With practice you can get all four right.
H8d: But the best you can manage is a draw.
H8e: Unless you cheat somehow.
H8f: Look at the machine closely.
H8g: Not everything is on the front.
H8h: Pull the machine away from the wall. Now look again. 
     See anything familiar?
H8i: You can hack into the machine and mess with it.
H8j: But put it back before asking Meagan to play.


Q9: I hacked into the trivia machine. What should I do?

H9a: Did you examine the machine before jacking in? 
H9b: Note the button colours.
H9c: Have you played against Meagan?
H9d: These are the databanks of questions and answers.
H9e: You can change the answers so Meagan gets her questions wrong.
H9f: What do you normally do with soccer balls?
H9g: Kick the balls to change the answers to that colour.
H9h: You can change the answers to whatever you like.
H9i: It's probably easier to change them all to one colour.
H9j: That way you'll remember the change.
H9k: And Meagan is guaranteed to get a question wrong.


Q10: I've beaten all the games, but can't get into the manager's office.

H10a: You only need to beat Lucky Dip, Wheel of Fate and the Lottery.
H10b: Have you visited the woman again?
H10c: More hoops to jump through.
H10d: The permit is for the game zone on level 28.
H10e: Go there and score at least 2000 points, then come back.
H10f: Now you can go upstairs.
H10g: But can only see the manager once per day.


Q11: What's my objective in the manager's office?

H11a: You can't get information from him directly.
H11b: And he won't volunteer any.
H11c: Look around the office.
H11d: Notice the cyberjack interface port on the desk.
H11e: You need to jack in to get the information.


Q12: How do I distract the manager?

H12a: You have no choice here.
H12b: Have you tried distracting him? It's obvious what he wants.
H12c: A kiss might work.
H12d: Sounds like he's into rough stuff. And he likes tough girls.
H12e: Beat him up a little then try again.
H12f: Now he's distracted.


Q13: Where's the cyberjack for the cross shaped interface port?

H13a: He doesn't trust his security staff that much.
H13b: The manager has the cyberjack on him.
H13c: It's in his jacket.
H13d: You'll need to distract him first. See the hints for Q11.
H13e: Now you can get the cyberjack.
H13f: Just don't let the manager see you with it.


Q14: How do I reach the interface port without being seen?

H14a: It's difficult from the middle of the room.
H14b: You need to decide where to distract the manager.
H14c: He likes being pushed around.
H14d: So push him onto the desk first.
H14e: You'll need to keep him there.
H14f: Get on top of the manager... or the desk.


Q15: I'm in the manager's cyberspace room, but can't open the treasure chest.

H15a: Look at the chest.
H15b: You need something to put in those slots.
H15c: The items are nearby.
H15d: The playing cards will fit, but you need to choose specific ones.
H15e: Remember the manager's tastes.
H15f: He has a thing for black women.
H15g: The cards you need are the queen of clubs and queen of spades.
H15h: Put those cards in the slots, and the chest will open.


Q16: What should I do with the wealth of information?

H16a: It's in cyberspace.
H16b: You can't take the information with you.
H16c: But you do need to look at it.
H16d: That's all you can do.


Q17: I've got the information. How do I get back into the manager's office?

H17a: Why do you want to?
H17b: You have everything you need.
H17c: So there's no reason to go back.


Q18: I've completed my mission in the casino. What next?

H18a: Remember Zacharias' instructions... assuming you have them.
H18b: If you haven't been to the biodome on level 12, go there.
H18c: If you've already completed that task, the only place left is the film
      studio.
H18d: The gates are open now, so go to level 27.


LEVEL 30 - NEO WEMBLEY STADIUM
------------------------------

Q1: How do I get into the stadium?

H1a: It's off limits for most of the game.
H1b: Until the very end.
H1c: Don't continue until you've got class one citizen status.
H1d: And discovered Lucy Song's secret.
H1e: Now you can finally get inside.


Q2: I'm inside the stadium. What am I supposed to do here?

H2a: You know where the bomb is.
H2b: And you're invisible.
H2c: You can't do anything from the stands.
H2d: So go down to the pitch.


Q3: What's my strategy for stopping Lucy Song?

H3a: Lucy Song's hard to deal with while she's running around.
H3b: Getting her off the soccer field would help.
H3c: You're invisible so take advantage.
H3d: Push Lucy around. She'll retaliate and get dismissed.
H3e: Well? Go follow her down the tunnel.


Q4: How do I get past Amber Bear in the changing room?

H4a: For a minute to so, you're very dazed.
H4b: Concentrate on dodging her attacks first.
H4c: A high swing can be ducked.
H4d: And you can jump over the low swing.
H4e: Her third attack is unstoppable.
H4f: You need something to use against Amber.
H4g: There's not much to play around with.
H4h: Not with that bench in the way.
H4i: That's the only thing in reach.
H4j: Look at the bench after Amber's swung it once.
H4k: That splinter will have to do.
H4l: You can't get it until the bench is really damaged.
H4m: Amber Bear is out of attack range.
H4n: So you'll have to do something else.
H4o: Throw the splinter at Amber.


Q5: I've dealt with Amber. What about Jet Scorpion?

H5a: Jet has you in a stranglehold.
H5b: You can't deal with her alone.
H5c: There's someone else in the room.
H5d: That should be something.
H5e: Have you looked at Lucy's body and head?
H5f: She could operate her body remotely, if she had power.
H5g: There's a source of power nearby.
H5h: If you don't do something it'll be the death of you.
H5i: Jet's whip can be electrified.
H5j: Turn the whip on, but make sure you're holding the head first.


Q6: Lucy's helping me out with Jet. What's the plan?

H6a: Lucy Song gave you one.
H6b: Grab the decagonal headed cyberjack.
H6c: Then run.


Q7: I'm trapped on the arch. Should I make a deal with Gustav?

H7a: You can if you want.
H7b: But that's rather selfish.
H7c: And not the best of endings.
H7d: But you'll survive.


Q8: I don't want those people to die. What are my other options?

H8a: The plural is optimistic.
H8b: You do have one other choice.
H8c: Listen to Lucy Song.
H8d: She has an interface port to disable the fission core.
H8e: But you need a strong wind to move her hair.
H8f: And there's no breeze.
H8g: But you could create one.
H8h: Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
H8i: Jump.


Q9: Help! I'm falling!

H9a: You don't have much time.
H9b: Act quickly.
H9c: There's an interface port. And a cyberjack.
H9d: You should know what to do by now.
H9e: See the interface port on Lucy's head? Jack into it.


Q10: I'm in cyberspace. How do I disarm the fission core?

H10a: Obviously you need to cut the wires.
H10b: You need to cut all eight of them.
H10c: Naturally, they must be cut in the correct sequence.
H10d: Intuitively, each wire is only cut once.
H10e: Lucy Song gave you the sequence just now.
H10f: The eight things she mentioned refer to a wire.
H10g: From immigrant to class one citizen. That refers to 
      the jewel colours.
H10h: Steel Rose to Utopia Freedom. What colour is a rose?
      And what colour do the Freedom wear?
H10i: From newbie to golden girl. What's the colour for a newbie?
      And what colour is gold?
H10j: What colours represent evil and good? If you've worked out the
      others, there are only two wires left.
H10k: The correct sequence of wires is: 
      clear, purple, red, blue, green, yellow, black, white.


Q11: I diffused the core, but now I'm dying.

H11a: Those people are still alive.
H11b: Your mission is complete.
H11c: All you can do now is wait for the end.


Q12: Is there a better ending?

H12a: You could have given the head to Gustav. Not exactly better.
H12b: Death isn't necessarily a bad thing.
H12c: You're an inspiration. And others may follow you.
H12d: If you got maximum points, then you got the best ending.

H3a: A trip to Mars.
H3b: Sort of. Have you examined the ticket?
H3c: It's for the travel agent on level 26.


Q4: What else can I get from Zacharias' body?

H4b: He has something you need... in a sense.
H4c: You'll have a better idea if you've visited level 32.

Q3: What do I need to access the deposit box?

H3a: Have you looked around?
H3b: Examined the terminal? The sign?
H3c: You need something to bypass the retinal scanner...
H3d: ...and a security code.
H3e: Which is five separate four digit numbers.
H3f: Don't attempt to access the box until you have everything.


Q4: The yellow contact lenses don't work!

H4a: Of course not. Security is tighter here.
H4b: There's an inbuilt safety measure.
H4c: Which means only a real eye will work.


Q5: Where and how do I get Professor Zacharias' eye?

H5a: Remember what the professor said before he died?
H5b: Utopia takes bodies to the morgue.
H5c: The morgue's on level 31.
H5d: See the hints for that level if you're still stuck.


Q6: Where do I find the security code?

H6a: It's complicated.
H6b: But Zacharias stored it in a safe place in case something
     happened to him.
H6c: Begin by searching the professor's office.
H6d: You need to access his cyberspace domain.
H6e: See the hints for level 25 and cyberspace for more information.


Q7: I've opened the deposit box. What use are the items inside?

H7a: The subbuteo piece will be handy later. Keep it.
H7b: The other item has a more immediate use.
H7c: Have you examined it?
H7d: Squeeze it to play a message from Lucy Song.


Q8: I've heard Lucy Song's recording. Now what?

H8a: She said a number of important things.
H8b: Including information on the subbuteo pieces she gave Zacharias...
H8c: ...and the name of another person who has one.
H8d: Know anybody called Bruce?
H8e: Remember the man in the retirement home?
H8f: Go to level 20 and ask Old Bruce about Lucy.
H8g: You need to be persuasive. See the hints for level 20.


LEVEL 33 - POLICE STATION
-------------------------

Q1: I've been captured.

H1a: It doesn't look good.
H1b: But there's no way to avoid it.
H1c: So relax as best you can.


Q2: How do I escape from the containment field?

H2a: Have you examined it?
H2b: Tried to break it?
H2c: Talked to the people outside?
H2d: The Utopian cells are a secure facility.
H2e: The only way out is when they let you out.


Q3: How do I save Professor Zacharias?

H3a: You'd need to be outside the containment field.
H3b: Which is escape proof.
H3c: In other words, you can't.
H3d: But pay close attention to his dying words.


Q4: Where should I begin my search for Lucy Song?

H4a: You're a class one citizen now.
H4b: And you have access to more areas.

H1a: This is where Utopia sentence criminals.
H1b: Do you want to be sentenced?
H1c: Are you on trial?
H1d: Are you a witness in a case?
H1e: Are you part of Utopia's justice system?
H1f: Have you received instructions to come here?
H1g: So what are you doing here?
H1h: There's nothing to see or do on level 34.


LEVEL 35 - REGISTRATION
-----------------------

Q1: I'm stuck on the landing pad.

H1a: Why not have a look around your new home?
H1b: At the laser fields?
H1c: And the not so friendly troops?
H1d: Follow up on Nanci's instruction.
H1e: He'll give you a prod if you wait long enough.
H1f: Focus on the troopers.
H1g: This is an important ability.


Q2: What can I focus on?

H2a: Most things in the game.
H2b: Nanci usually has a comment.
H2c: Sometimes not so helpful, but other times essential.
H2d: It's worth focusing on everything you come across.
H2e: Especially if it's techonology.


Q3: I'm in the waiting area, but nothing happens.

H3a: Something does happen shortly after you arrive.
H3b: Someone dropped something in the grate.
H3c: And you need that item.
H3d: The guards are busy processing and there's a lot of immigrants.
H3e: So go grab that thing.


Q4: I can't find the item the guard dropped.

H4a: You did examine the grate?
H4b: It's not much use closed.
H4c: Have you looked at the water?
H4d: You know there's something there.
H4e: If you can't see it...
H4f: Feel the water... or reach into it.
H4g: The antiviral inhaler will prove very useful.


Q5: What do I do at the registration terminal?

H5a: You're given precise instructions.
H5b: Which you need to follow.
H5c: Begin by inserting your visa.
H5d: But make sure you examine it first.


Q6: The machine's asked for a passport, but I don't have it.

H6a: Alice isn't stupid enough to come without one.
H6b: She has it with her.
H6c: Did you look at what you're carrying?
H6d: The jacket can be opened.
H6e: Your passport is in the inside pocket.
H6f: Follow Nanci's advice and look at it.


Q7: I don't know the answers to Teresa's questions.

H7a: You have all the information you need.
H7b: Be sure to examine the visa and passport before you give them up.
H7c: And take a look at the clothes.
H7d: Your full name is Alice Wei Ling.
H7e: You were born in Shanghai China.
H7f: The other questions require some deduction.
H7g: Remember to be simple when giving answers.


Q8: What's my age?

H8a: Have you examined yourself?
H8b: Alice is in her mid twenties. You could try guessing.
H8c: But there's a way to know for sure.
H8d: Examine the terminal and remember the passport.
H8e: You were born in 2141...
H8f: ...and the current year is 2165.
H8g: Your birthday has passed. That makes you 24 years old.


Q9: What's my previous occupation?

H9a: Did you examine your clothes?
H9b: Your cover story is you cleaned sewers in Shanghai.
H9c: So try sewer cleaner... or cleaner... or janitor.


Q10: What about marital status and child's name?

H10a: Remember the description of the visa.
H10b: You're a widow. That'll work, and so will single.
H10c: Nanci gives you a clue to the child's name.
H10d: Baby boy? Personal signature?
H10e: Nanci named the child after himself.


Q11: I've tried using the antiviral inhaler, but nothing happens.

H11a: Have you examined the inhaler?
H11b: Focused on the inhaler?
H11c: There's more to it than first appears.
H11d: It doesn't work because the inside is hollow.
H11e: Have you tried opening it?
H11f: Pulling obviously doesn't work.
H11g: Look at the description closer.
H11h: You can unscrew the inhaler.
H11i: It can be used to transport small items around the 
      arcology undetected. Useful for illegal stuff.


Q12: What's this black screwdriver?

H12a: It looks like a normal screwdriver.
H12b: But the description might tip you off.
H12c: Nanci's the technical one.
H12d: Focus on the screwdriver.
H12e: It's actually a morphtool.
H12f: Best put it back in the inhaler for now.


Q13: What should I do in the decontamination chamber?

H13a: Most stuff here is as it appears.
H13b: You need to clean yourself.
H13c: First throw those work clothes in the chute.
H13d: Then take a shower by standing on the platform.
H13e: You can now get the bodysuit.


Q14: I've put the bodysuit on but it doesn't come off.

H14a: That's intentional. It's designed that way.
H14b: You'll be wearing the bodysuit for the rest of the game.
H14c: So get used to it.


Q15: I can't leave the decontamination chamber.

H15a: You can't go back the way you came.
H15b: So you need to go north.
H15c: First you need to get changed. See the above hints.
H15d: There's one more thing you need to do.
H15e: Did you examine the bodysuit?
H15f: That indentation looks useful.
H15g: Got anything rectangular shaped?
H15h: Put the ID tag on the suit.
H15i: Now you can proceed.


Q16: What can I look for in the level directory?

H16a: Anything you want.
H16b: It lists what's on certain Arcology levels.
H16c: If you need to find a place, this is where to look it up.


Q17: Where should I go first?

H17a: You don't have a lot of choice.
H17b: Remember Nanci's advice.
H17c: Find your apartment. Look that up in the directory.
H17d: You're not the luxurious type.
H17e: You need to go to the standard apartments on level 18.


Q18: What items can I take in the transporter tubes?

H18a: Certain items are restricted to the level you find them.
H18b: And other things are completely illegal.
H18c: There's more information in your apartment.
H18d: And it might be a good idea to inspect the inhaler more 
      closely. See the above hints for more advice.
