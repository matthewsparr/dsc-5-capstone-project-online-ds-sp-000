"How to construct a crude pulley system in public under life and death
circumstances, while a mischievous ape tries repeatedly to pull your
shorts down"

This document contains complete spoilers for the game "Three Monkeys One
Cage" by Robert Goodwin. It is inadvisable to be reading this if you
haven't looked at the general in-game hints (type "HINT" during the
game), and even then this document should be used sparingly. The game is
hard, but try to solve as much of it by yourself as you can, yeah?
You'll feel better about yourself.

This solution is explained by sections.

THE MANDRILL -- Keeping him out of your hair

Generally whenever the mandrill enters your corner of the cage or you
enter his, you have one turn to act before he does you in. Early on you
can avoid death by simply moving to a differenct corner of the cage
whenever he approaches. After no sooner than 50 turns into the game the
mandrill will become more aggressive, chasing you almost every turn.
Temporary methods of fending him off, such as throwing dirt at him or
hiding under the bed, may give you a quick breather, but you need a
long-term solution. There are two...


THE HORNETS -- Dangerous when aggravated

The hornets will mind their own business just as long as you don't go
casting a stone at their nest, at which point they will fly all about,
attacking both monkeys and you. From this time on both the chimpanzee
and mandrill will do nothing but run around wildly. This is good in the
sense that the mandrill no longer poses a threat to you, but bad in the
sense that the chimpanzee can no longer help you. Therefore you must
wait until you no longer need the chimpanzee before taking this course
of action, because there is no way to recall the hornets. (If the game
becomes unwinnable when you throw the rock at the nest then you still
needed the chimpanzee to do something)

How do you survive the hornets yourself? Hiding under the bed is only a
temporary solution. To protect yourself for good you'll need to cover
yourself with a sheet or a blanket.


THE FIRE -- Ins and outs of taming flame

Neither the mandrill nor chimpanzee will enter any corner of the cage
where fire or smoke is if they can help it. In order to build a fire you
will need flint, steel, and tinder. The stone serves as flint. The
barbecue fork, the bucket, or the fan serves as steel. The sheet,
blanket, or jersey can be used as tinder. Obviously, to keep the fire
going you'll have to keep feeding it with flammable objects.

If you choose to build the fire in the southwest corner of the cage, you
have the advantage of being able to use the fan to blow smoke (when the
fire is large enough to produce sufficient smoke) to one of the other
three corners. By rotating the fan you can steer the mandrill out of any
corner of your choosing. In addition, the fire will last longer when the
fan is on.

The risk you take when you build the fire in the southwest corner is
that it might catch to your bed. If this happens you must act quickly.
Put out the fire by throwing or kicking dirt onto it.


THE BUCKET -- Don't kick it yourself, let somebody do it for you

How do you get the bucket off the platform? There is no way to get atop
the platform yourself. Only the chimpanzee can, but he needs an
incentive to go there. Hmm, I wonder what that might be. Yes, toss the
banana onto the platform. The chimpanzee will soon jump after it,
knocking the bucket off inadvertently. The bucket will land in the
southwest corner.


BUILDING THE PULLEY -- It's the only way to open the gate

The solution to Three Monkeys One Cage in a nutshell is to set up a
pulley system in which the cord is slung over the bar that protrudes
from the wall, with a bucket attached to the end of the cord. The other
end of the cord is already attached to the top of the gate permanently.
When a weight falls into the bucket, the bucket descends, causing the
gate to rise.

The cord can be tied to various objects, then thrown over the bar. It is
not enough simply to tie the cord to the bucket, for you'll find out
that the cord is short by just a tiny margin when the weight falls and
misses it. You must first tie the cord to a hook, then once the cord is
dangling from the bar you must get the bucket hanging from the hook
somehow. A hook can be found underneath your bed.

The only way to get the bucket onto the hook once it has been slung over
the bar is to lift it using the barbecue fork.


ACTIVATING THE PULLEY -- Getting the weight to drop

Once your pulley is all set up you are ready to drop the weight in the
bucket. If you haven't guessed already, it is a coconut that must be
used for the weight. Have the chimpanzee get one for you. (CHIMP, CLIMB
TREE followed by CHIMP, GET COCONUT)

The coconut must roll down the trough, which you cannot reach yourself.
You need the chimpanzee again for this. (CHIMP, PUT COCONUT ON TROUGH)
If the coconut isn't staying on the trough properly, that is because you
did not remove the husk. You can crack it open with the stone or with
the barbecue fork.

Just because the coconut is on the trough does not mean that it will
roll automatically. The trough must be inclined. You can use the
barbecue fork to raise one end of it. At last, the coconut will fall
into the bucket and the gate will open! (If the coconut isn't landing
squarely in the bucket, read the previous section carefully)


GETTING OUT ALIVE -- How to leap a great distance and live to tell

After you've gotten the gate open there is still more puzzle left to be
solved. The distance to the ground below is too great to jump, yet jump
you must. But you'll need to make some preparations. To begin with, you
must use the cord again in a different way. You need to hold onto it, or
tie it around your waist when you leap outside. The dilemma is in the
fact that the cord can only be used for one purpose at a time; it can't
be tied around your waist while it is being used for the pulley. Were
you to remove the bucket from the hook with the barbecue fork, then pull
away the cord, the gate would go back down. Thus you must keep the gate
open another way while you remove the cord from the bar. Do this by
placing an object in the opening to hold the gate up. Namely, the
barbecue fork.


DISMANTLING THE PULLEY -- But only once you no longer need it

The gate's open and you need that cord again. But the barbecue fork
which could otherwise be used to remove the bucket from the hook is no
longer available. How do you retrieve the cord? This is perhaps the most
difficult part of the puzzle, and it requires some timing. The fact is
that you DO need the fork for this. Before placing it in the gate you
must use that versatile tool in one more capacity--as a torch. The
barbecue fork can be used to lift burning objects out of the fire, such
as the jersey, or the banana peel, or the coconut husk. You can then
"light the fuse" by touching the torch to the cord. Then, before the
cord snaps, extinguish the burning object and wedge that fork in the
gate, as explained above.


THE FINAL STEP -- Before you can fly the cage

Using the procedure described in the previous two sections, you can
almost survive that drop. One more precaution need be taken in order for
you to fall the remainder of the distance without injury. You must
cushion your fall. Throw as many object out the cage as you like, but
the only one that will make any difference is the mattress. Be aware
that you can't pick up the mattress while you're carrying other things.


THE ANVILS -- Death from above

After precisely 100 turns into the game, panels on the ceiling will open
up to release heavy anvils. A falling anvil will most certainly crush
you in five turns unless you take cover by hiding under your bed.
Whereupon the anvils will cease, and bombs will begin dropping in their
stead. When the bombs start dropping you have only nine turns left to
complete the game, so act quickly! There is no way to outlive the bombs
save by completing the puzzle and escaping from the cage.

Questions and Answers
=====================

A. General Questions
--------------------

Can I restore my saved games without having to wait?

 - With the MS-DOS version, you can change your computer's time to
   be more than 30 minutes past the save time. Or you can change the time
   in the save file to be earlier. Changing the byte at position 0C (hex) 
   to a value of 0 always seems to work.


I'm dying of thirst? What do I do?

 - Drink some water.

 - There are various places in the game (including the building) that
   make good water sources. You can also carry one drink's worth in the
   bottle.

 - And the flask also takes a small amount of water.


I'm running out of light! What can I do?

 - You could make sure you finish the game before your lantern dies.

 - You could buy some batteries in the 'all different' maze.

 - You could use the appropriate magic words. They will give your lamp
   a one-time boost good for several hundred moves.

 - Harnessing electricity is a kind of sorcery.

 - There are a couple of words you may have seen that suggest a famous
   person often associated with electricity.

 - They're found in the Sorcerer's Lair. Type them as separate commands.

 - Don't do it until your lamp is out of power.

 - Drop your lamp first. 


What do I do about these little dwarves?

 - If you could just get them on your side, you could have one heck
   of a party.

 - But they're set in their ways. 

 - The first dwarf that attacks you drops an axe. Get it, then throw it
   whenever there are dwarves attacking you.

 - Throwing the sword works too, as does just waving it about.

 - Eventually, you'll also learn a magic word that you can use to defeat
   them.


A pirate stole my treasure. How can I get it back?

 - Actually, you need this to happen, or you won't be able to get his
   treasure chest.
 
 - After he steals from you, go find his chest in the 'all alike' maze.
   He won't steal from you after you get it.


What should I do with the dwarf's horn?

 - A bunch of dwarves attack you when you blow it.

 - The right magic word might get rid of them.

 - It's handy for getting back any treasure stolen by the dwarves.

 - It's easier if you wear some protection.

 - And a magic way to get rid of the dwarves helps too, just be
   careful you follow the instructions.

 - Then again, you could call the owl instead.


B. Above Ground
---------------

What am I doing here?
 
 - As an adventurer of some ambition, you are trying to collect a bunch 
   of treasures in the small brick building without getting killed.

 - If you do, you might get a nice reward.

 - You may be looking for something in which to carry water.

 - Follow the path that leads away from the house.

 _ I said "the path", not "the road"!


How do I get into the cave?
	
 - There are two ways.

 - The obvious way is to unlock the grate with the keys from the building.

 - You will also learn a couple of magic words that will let you teleport
   in and out from the building.


How do I get past the wizard's gate?

 - The gate is hinged on both sides.

 - First, you have to undo the hinges with some sort of screwdriver.

 - A certain treasure would make a good screwdriver.

 - I'm lying -- there's no way past.


What's the meaning of the wooden notice?

 - I would read it as 'To those who come after me: this is the place to
   ---- the s--'.

 - It's not important until much later in the game. I'd better not reveal
   the answer just yet.


C. Hall of Mists and Vicinity
-----------------------------

How do I get past the snake?

 - You can't subdue it yourself.

 - You need the help of another being.

 - Catch the bird in the cage, then 'drop bird' or 'free bird' in the 
   Hall of Mt King.


How can I keep the bird from being frightened?

 - Read carefully what the game tells you when you first ask for help.

 - The bird is afraid of something about you.

 - Did you read the instructions offered to you when you entered the game?
   It is written: "Some objects have side-effects; for instance, rods
   scare birds."

 - It's afraid of your black rod. Drop it before trying to catch the bird.


How do I get past the dragon?

 - Just attack it.

 - Yes, with your bare hands.

 - Don't you wish all the monsters were this wimpy?


How do I get the Persian rug?

 - Roll it up first.


How do I get the gold nugget out of the cave?

 - You could try throwing it to that passage above the dome.

 - But the result is not very convenient.

 - Rather than carrying it up the steps, use a magic-word exit.


What does the hollow voice mean?

 - It's saying a magic word.

 - The word will teleport you between the Y2 room and the building.
   This is usually the quickest way to get from the cave to the building
   and back.


How do I get across the fissure?

 - Wave the rod. (Nothing really suggests this specifically, but it
   stands to reason that magic wands are made for waving.)


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all different?

 - The names of the locations are subtly different.

 - By making a grid and noting where each direction leads from
   each location, you can build a map. It's a hassle, though.

 - Actually, you don't need to go into this maze to finish the game with
   all the points.

 - I haven't mapped it all out myself. From the west end of long hall,
   you can go 'south, up, up, south' to get to the vending machine.

 - 'north, down, down, down' should get you back out.


How do I navigate the maze of passages, all alike?

 - This is probably the most famous maze in all of computer gaming. You
   should feel honored just to be lost in it. 

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.

 - To distinguish the rooms from each other, drop various objects in them.
   Then you can make a grid and chart out which directions go from where
   to where.

 - Or you can ask the game to cheat and show you the list of exits from
   every location, which makes them very much less alike.

 - The main thing is to get the pirate's treasure chest and any treasures
   he's stolen from you.

 - From the west end of the Hall of Mists, you can go south, east, south,
   south, south, north, east, east, northwest to get to the chest. Then go
   southeast, north, down to get out of the maze.


What does the message in the sandstone chamber mean?

 - It's a favourite quote from technical manuals.

 - It's in Dwarvish. Surely you can read Dwarvish!

 - Translate it by moving each letter back one in the alphabet.

 - This method works for translating the dwarves' speech, too.


How do I get the flute from the shadowy figure?

 - Is the figure trying to attract your attention?

 - Have you seen it in more than one place?

 - It seems familiar.

 - It looks a lot like you.

 - It is you. Go to the mirror canyon for an explanation.

 - There is no flute, of course. I made that up.

 - But you could try 'reflect' and see what happens.

 - Reflecting gets you to the other side of the mirror, though it is
   not at all obvious.


D. Anteroom and Vicinity
------------------------

What are the magazines for?

 - They are traditionally associated with a last lousy point.
  
 - Leaving them at Witt's End gives you that point. 

 - Why at Witt's End? I haven't the faintest idea.


How do I get out of Witt's End?

 - If you go west sixty-five times, you'll get to the anteroom. It 
   always feels longer on the way back.

 - Wait -- maybe it's 165 times.

 - Actually, just wander around, going any direction except west.
   After a few moves, you should get out.


How do I get the tusk out of the very low room?

 - There's no way to get it through the slit.

 - The only way out is down into the sewer, although you seem to die
   when you go there.

 - Perhaps you should wait till the sewage level drops.

 - Actually, if you go back up from the shaft and then down again, you'll
   be able to get into the sewers.

 - You'll find anything you lost down the shaft (or in the cellar), plus a
   spoon.

 - Make sure to find your way out before you drown, and before
   the rats get you.


How do I navigate the maze of passages with streams?

 - I must say, I roll my eyes at the solution to this one.

 - The game's hint suggests that you're somehow offending the dwarves,
   I guess.

 - You've just left the sewers. Maybe it's that nasty smell.

 - 'wash', then wander up until you get out.


How do I turn the spoon into a treasure?

 - 'epns' seems like it ought to be a magic word.

 - But it's not. 

 - Did you try polishing it?

 - I guess the spoon is just worthless.


What is the rope in the chapel for?

 - Climb it.


How can I get out of the giant's dungeon?

 - 'lift flagstone', then go south, then climb up.

 - Of course, you probably lost some stuff when you got thrown in, and
   the trick is getting it back.


What do I do in the giant's living quarters?

 - You could bring the food with you. Then he'll eat it and kick you
   back out. But that doesn't get you anywhere.

 - What else might the giant enjoy?

 - Bring the nest with you. While he's eating the eggs, you can do what you
   like. Of course, the nest is a treasure, so you'll need to get it back
   somehow. See the troll question for more help.

 - The room description doesn't actually say so, but you can go south, too.


How do I get past the spider?

 - Kill it with the sword.

 - But surely you don't have the sword yet.

 - You'll have to engage the help of a nearby friend.

 - The owl will eat the spider for you. Summon him with 'hoot'.

 - Your light scares him away. Turn it off first.

 - To get the documents, just cut the web with your axe.


How do I get the mask in the thieves den?

 - The game says you can't. And it tells the truth.


How do I get the orb from the cellar?

 - If you could only get past the portcullis.

 - Or the slab.

 - Or the drain. Which is it?

 - It's none of these. The actual solution seems obscure, frankly.

 - Get the orb, then drop something else. If it goes down the drain,
   get it later in the sewer.

 - If you drop anything large, e.g. the sword, the wizard kicks it out
   with you. 

 - Of course, you may be able to get the orb without going into the
   cellar.

 - A portcullis is not the same thing as a solid door, and the drain
   has its uses.

 - No, you'll have to work out the rest for yourself. Or go into
   the cellar, like everybody else does.



What do the images in the orb mean?

 - They're visions of things that will happen as you play the game.

 - They can be used as a guide in a particular chain of problems.

 - You'll have to work out for yourself how to know whether the
   vision you see indicates your next task, or some random future
   one.

 - You don't need to use the visions, so you don't need to be told
   how to do that.


What is the crypt for?

 - That's where the vampire shows up. I hope you found the crucifix and the
   holy water.

 - To summon the vampire, you need the wizard's help.

 - There are several ways to invoke the wizard's help. One of them involves
   the little bird. Read the description carefully.

 - Sorry, I'm lying again. The vampire doesn't move into the crypt until
   Adventure 770. In this game the crypt is just scenery.


How do I get into the storage room in the tower?

 - No way to do that in this version.



How do I get past the dwarves at the top of the stairs?

 - You could attack them from above.

 - First you'd need to get on top of the tower from the outside.

 - But you can't. There is no way to get past them. At least not in
   this version of the game.


What is special about the chalice?

 - If you fill the chalice and then drink, some strange things happen.
  
 - But whatever you do, you end up losing the chalice, which is a treasure.

 - It's fun to try, but I don't think you can help the princess 
   successfully. Just treat the chalice like any other treasure.


E. Bedquilt and Vicinity
------------------------

Can I get around the Bedquilt area more easily?

 - In some places, you can type the name of an adjacent room
   to get to it. That can help avoid the problem of crawling around and
   winding up back where you started from.


How do I keep the vase from shattering?

 - You need to cushion its fall.

 - Before you drop it, drop the pillow from the soft room.


How do I get a light source into the room past the emerald?

 - If you could carry a light source into the plover room, that would do
   it. But nothing will fit in from the west. 

 - Are there any other ways to get to the plover room?

 - Yes, actually. Pay attention to the bad pun in the plover room hint.

 - "Why to plover" means "Y2, plover". Typing 'plover' in the Y2 room
   will get you there. 'Plover' will get you back too, but you can't get
   the emerald out that way. This is not something you could figure out,
   but you can stumble across the solution by trying to refer to the 
   plover-egg-sized emerald as "plover".

 - There is actually a way to get a light source into the plover room
   from the alcove, as the hint suggests.

 - It's something that can be in two places at once.

 - But you need to ignite it first.



What do I do with the clam?

 - You can pick it up.

 - You can open it.

 - What would be a good tool for clam prying? Think of sea-related things.

 - 'open clam' while you're carrying the trident.

 - A pearl rolled out. Go down to the cul-de-sac and get it.


How do I get past the quicksand?

 - Create a bridge.

 - Read the game's responses carefully.

 - When you wave the rod here, although nothing obvious happens, you
   temporarily solidify the quicksand. You have to wave the rod again
   to get back.


How do I cross the reservoir?

 - A full-sized yacht would help.

 - Could you magick the "Ruby Yacht" (my, what an awful pun!) to grow
   in size? Or maybe shrink yourself enough to use the yacht?

 - No dice. You can't get across it from the south.

 - Read the game's hint.

 - You can get to the north side by going down the whirlpool in the 
   waterfall cavern. Make sure not to take anything but your lamp.

 - Hit the gong to summon Darwin, whom you can ride south.


How do I get the sword in the stone?

 - Like the game's hint says, you're just not strong enough.

 - Someone with bulging muscles could probably pull it out.

 - Eat the mushroom from the dank cave.


How can I keep from losing objects in the valuation room?

 - Don't drop them there.


F. The Plant and Beyond
-----------------------

What do I do with the little plant?

 - It seems to want water.

 - Bring water in your bottle, then 'water plant'.

 - Do it once more for good measure. Now you can climb up to the hole.

 - Maybe you should try watering it a third time?


How do I get past the rusted door?

 - It just needs a little oil.

 - Fill your bottle with oil from the east pit in the Twopit room,
   then 'oil door'.


How do I get past the ogre?

 - The game's hint warns against hand-to-hand combat. 

 - Throw something.

 - The axe isn't good enough.

 - Throw the sword. Its name is 'Thrower', after all.


Is there anything to do in the Sorcerer's Lair?

 - Remember the magic words on the wall.

 - You might have seen or will see something that emits blue light.
   Maybe it is at home here?

 - Try dropping the starstone here.

 - Yes, the effect can be handy in some special circumstances, but you 
   don't really need to do this.


How do I get past the sheets of slime?

 - Fight the green slime with something green.

 - Throw the vial from the spherical room.


How do I get out of the maze of ice tunnels?

 - Map the maze. The passages are all either straight, or bend only
   a little.

 - Don't miss the sculpture.

 - Look at your map upside down. It spells a five-letter word.

 - Go to the 'This way out' room and use that word.


G. The Troll and Beyond
-----------------------

How do I get past the troll?

 - Throw him a treasure.

 - You'll need one you can reclaim.

 - Throw him the nest.

 - Remember the words in the Giant room?

 - Type them, one after another. You should get the response 'Done!' at the
   end.

 - The eggs then return to the Giant room.

 - Make sure you don't reclaim them until you've finished with the area
   past the bridge. Otherwise the troll will take revenge on you.


How do I get back across the wooden bridge?

 - You need help. Something scary.

 - The bear can help.

 - Free him, then 'get bear'.

 - Use the keys to unlock the chain.

 - Feed the bear first.

 - Try to cross the bridge, then 'free bear'.


Is there anything to do in the volcano room?

 - Not in the original 350-point version of Adventure.

 - Here, yes.

 - Make a bridge. You know the routine.

 - You need something to protect you from the fumes. How about a
   mithril ring?

 - You can turn the sword into a ring. Use a magic word.

 - It's the word written on the stone you found the sword in.


What do I do at the minotaur statue?

 - There's a hint at a dead end elsewhere in the cave.

 - You need to use the proper tool.

 - The proper tool can be found in the tool room.

 - Not the rags. The proper tool is a magic word.


How do I get away from the gooseberry goblins?

 - Are you familiar with the myth of Cadmus?

 - I think he sowed something and grew an army of soldiers, although his
   soldiers ended up fighting each other.

 - He sowed dragon's teeth, as I recall. You can just throw them.


How do I get through the fog?

 - The game's hint suggests a question that is answered differently in
   different places.

 - 'Do I need to have my lamp on?' is a good question.

 - The answer to the question is 'Not here'.


What is the pentagram for?

 - Use it to imprison summoned beings.

 - You can imprison the London Dry Djinn in it.

 - Drop the flask here, then open it, then free the Djinn.


How can I get the starstone after I drop it?

 - It has strange spatial properties.

 - It's sort of in two places at once. One location (the one not where you
   drop it) is where it's real.

 - So when you drop it in the building, it's not really there. Note that
   you don't get points when you drop it there.

 - You need to drop it somewhere else outside.

 - Remember the wooden notice? The last word was 'starstone'.

 - Luckily, the Djinn will take care of the giant for you.


How can I get back past the basilisk?

 - Use the old mirror trick.

 - That metal plate ought to do fine.

 - But it needs polishing.

 - 'rub plate' while you're carrying the rags. Then carry the
   mirror past the basilisk.


How do I get out of the catacombs?

 - They're hard to map, since they change from game to game.

 - It works like this. The first time you go through the catacombs, any
   sequence of eighteen moves will get you back to 'Y2?'. That sequence
   determines the layout of the catacombs. When you reenter, you have to
   move the same way, or you end up kind of going backward. If you like,
   you can play around with dropping objects and see what I mean. I usually
   just go straight west the first time. Then I reenter, go west eleven or 
   twelve times, then wander around a little until I get to the portal.

 - After I leave the area past the portal, I just go straight west until
   I'm back at 'Y2?'.


How do I get the skeleton's sceptre past the bridge?

 - You need to leave it behind and get it later.

 - Leave it in the safe. You can also enter the safe from the room with 
   vaulted ceiling.

 - How do you open the safe? The game's hint suggests a skeleton key.

 - Use the magic word the skeleton gave you.

 - The word changes from game to game.  Make sure you use the right one.
   (There are four of them, and you'll need to know all four to finish
   the game.)


How do I learn all skeleton magic words?

 - You don't need them yet.

 - But you will.

 - Try wearing the crown.

 - Can't hear anything intelligible? Maybe you should try listening.

 - Just make sure you don't wind up dead.


What is the Djinn's word for?

 - It defeats dwarves. Of course, it also sometimes destroys your
   weapons and even gets you killed. Make sure you follow the Djinn's
   advice.


H. The End Game
---------------

The cave is closing! What should I do?

 - You should feel happy, since it means you've found all the treasures and
   are preparing to head to the end game.

 - Just wander around until the cave closes.


The cave has closed. What's going on here?

 - You need to get out of the repository.

 - Breaking the mirror doesn't work.

 - There's one kind of object here you haven't seen before.

 - The rods with red marks (not stars) are actually dynamite.

 - Blow up the northeast area.

 - Drop one of the red-mark rods in the northeast area, then go southwest,
   then 'blast'.

 - If you could get one of those lamps lit, you could go through the hole.

 - There's no way to light them.

 - Just ride the unicorn. 


I'm surrounded by gray mist. What do I do?

 - That's it! You've won!

 - Not really. You need to magic-word your way out of here.

 - There are sixteen magic words in the game. Note that 'plover' is a
   'travel option' -- it is not considered a magic word.

 - Just say them in the right order. The game will respond 'Ok.' after
   each one.

 - Remember the Djinn's story about Ralph Witt?

 - Ralph Witt liked the idea of reverse alphabetical order.

 - Say the words in reverse alphabetical order.

 - Still no luck? That's because the magic word given to you by the
   skeleton changes from game to game, and you need to know all its
   possible versions.

 - Perhaps you should have worn the crown, which you found in the safe.


I'm back at end of road again. What do I do?

 - First, you'll notice that the locations are connected backward.

 - There are other small changes.

 - The notice at the view has changed.

 - But it doesn't say anything useful.

 - The five-inch slit is now a five-foot slit.

 - Go ahead. Go on in.


I. Super Spoilers
-----------------

What are all the magic words?

 - I just can't bring myself to reveal them here. I think the hints in
   this file tell you all you need to find them, though. Remember, there
   are sixteen individual words, and 'plover' is not one of them.


What are all the treasures?

 - There are thirty-two treasures in all:

   bag of pieces of eight (beach)
   crown (safe)
   nugget (nugget of gold room)
   diamonds (west side of fissure)
   silver (N/S passage)
   jewelry (south side chamber)
   coins (west side chamber)
   treasure chest (dead end in maze of passages, all alike)
   nest of golden eggs (Giant room)
   trident (cavern with waterfall)
   helmet (Morion room)
   vase (Oriental room)
   emerald (plover room)
   sceptre (east end of Audience Hall)
   yacht (southern edge of reservoir)
   pyramid (Dark room)
   pearl (cul-de-sac)
   rug (secret canyon)
   spices (chamber of boulders)
   beads (balcony above treasure chamber)
   chain (barren room)
   spyglass (south end of Jonah room)
   sculpture (ice tunnels)
   bracelet (room with translucent walls)
   casket of opals (very small chamber)
   orb (cellar)
   tusk (bones room)
   chalice (recess in the beams)
   sapphire (living quarters)
   crucifix (thieves den)
   starstone (narrow basalt shelf)
   ring (created by player)
 

How do I get all the points?

 - Points are gained as follows:

    20 for getting into a dark area of the cave for the first time
    10 for getting to beach
    10 for getting to Sorcerer's Lair
    10 for getting to Valley of the Stone Faces
     8 for freeing Djinn
    15 for getting to Audience Hall
     7 for discovering each treasure (224 total -- Note that the tusk is
       not considered discovered until you drop it in the building.)
     8 for leaving each treasure in the building (256 total)
    16 shortly before 'cave closing' notice
    16 for getting 'cave closing' notice
    19 for getting to repository
    16 for getting to gray mist
    23 for getting to end of road in the end game
    16 for winning

   659 total? Oh, yes, the last lousy point...

     1 for getting magazines at Witt's End

   660 total. 

 - Points can be lost as follows:

    10 lost for reincarnation
    20 lost for taking a hint

             $adventure walkthrough
          rev. by Jessica Allan 08/02/97

This will RUIN the game for you.  Do not use it unless you
are truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your
life.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this
will ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even 
contains some of the ending.

This is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer's walkthrough, with 
better documentation and some improvements made.  

These commands will not work in every single game.  There 
are some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work
for the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 
point, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows
version does not conform to this, although the documentation
*may* be helpful.  

I highly recommend Rick Adams' page:
http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/
This contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an
FTP site providing source code and compiled versions for 
DOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.
Even with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due 
to some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to
compensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.

For those reasons, you cannot feed this through input 
redirection, although, if you're astute enough, you could 
probably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But
I doubt anyone would bother.

I can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure
on the Web at Stanford's machine:
http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html
That is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the
original format that was used, such as five letter packing
and such that was output from the other machine.  How close
this is to the original version, I can't say.
I recommend the Web version if you're running a 14.4 
connection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit
outdated anyway.

Enjoy playing, and I'm sorry I had to do this to you.  But
if it wasn't for this walkthrough, I never would have gotten
on with *my* life.  :)

Tinseltown Blues walkthrough - by Eytan Zweig
---------------------------------------------

Note - this is a no-frills walkthrough of "Tinseltown Blues". It was written
for version 1.1. 

This walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is 
not an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores 
several non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions
to some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.

On the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant 
chunks, so it's more-or-less clear why you're doing what you're doing. This 
means that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it 
should be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game 
without necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section
I say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from 
beginning to end will know where to begin from.

Note that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, 
but others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will 
say so. 

A final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper 
building) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that 
period, you won't be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker's desk, 
which is randomly determined each game.

Solution to "Bullhockey!" by B F Lindsay

THE APARTMENT

You begin "Bullhockey!" in the upstairs bedroom of your apartment.  Of course you should read the crumpled note, which basically spells out your predicament--your girlfriend Natalie has apparently left, and you are without your work shirts, which you will need to return to work the following Monday (currently it's Wednesday), if only to re-establish some sanity or order in your life.  You won't immediately be able to get down the stairs, because Natalie seems to have returned, to look for her 'mojo' (her 'lucky charm'), and moved some bookcases to block the bottom of the stairway (it's a narrow staircase)--you'll learn this from the sticky note she left on one of the bookcases.  You won't be able to move them from where you are--you'll have to get down by some other means.  All you will need from the upper level here is your backpack, your notepad (SEARCH PILE--the one by the bed), and your walking stick (the staff--LOOK UNDER BED).  Make sure you always have these things, though there will be a few times where you'll  have to put them down.

This is a small, two-story apartment--the overhead fan is just over the banister from all locations on this upper level--but at different distances from each location.  It is also your ticket downstairs, but first, you'll have to turn it off.  The switch is on the fan itself, but you cannot reach it with your hands--you'll need the staff to turn it off with.  If you look at the fan from different locations, you'll see (or not) the switch from different angles.  The switch is on the side opposite from the Loft Bedroom--it is in full view from Stairs--but way too distant.  However, in Bedroom Entrance, it is much closer and you see it in profile--an ideal angle from which to HIT FAN SWITCH WITH STAFF.  Now you want to GET ON FAN, but not from Bedroom Entrance, because you also want something sturdy which will break your fall, when the fan detaches, and possibly reduce chance of injury--how about the train-safe refridgerator??  Go to Loft Bedroom and GET ON FAN (JUMP OVER BANISTER will also work, there).   You will now be able to MOVE BOOKCASES from downstairs--if you want.

You can now explore the apartment, if only to find some clue of where to start your mission.  Read the message on the mirror in the bathroom, take the binoculars, in the black case (these will be indispensible) from Natalie's bedroom. You'll find the key to her closet stuck in her chair cushions if you SIT IN NATALIE'S CHAIR or SEARCH NATALIE'S CHAIR.  You can look in her closet (SEARCH ART DESK to find the light switch for it), but that won't be useful until you find all the shirts.  When you leave Natalie's room, after getting the binocs--Surprise!--you find your office shoes!  Easy points!  Go to the Kitchen and look out the back window--see the odd flash of red?  LOOK AT ODD FLASH WITH BINOCULARS.  Now you have a sense of purpose.  You can go out the front door now, but be sure you're clear on which building the Red Shirt is on top of.  The building right in front of your back window, the one with the black trampoline on top, is Brockwood's Men's Store.  The building that has your shirt on top is the one directly across the street from it going due east--from Brockwood's and your back window (on the east wall of the apartment).  You just need to remember that it's across from Brockwood's.

THE RED SHIRT

- WALTER

Going north out the front gate from the parking lot, you go east to Center Street, then go south to get to Brockwood's.  You are free to do some exploring, but your destination is really the building across the street from Brockwood's.  It's the Vacant Building.  You can't climb up the building from the street; you'll have to go into the building--the main entrance is barred off--but there is another entrance--go south then east into the Gravel Lot--the entrance is north from here.  You'll have to find out how to get Walter to let you in.  Ask him some questions--ASK WALTER ABOUT MAGAZINE, ASK WALTER ABOUT HIMSELF, ASK WALTER ABOUT BUILDING, ASK WALTER ABOUT REHAB, ASK WALTER ABOUT LUNCH BOX--you can ask him about other things (even your Red Shirt), but the idea is to gain his trust by showing an interest in him and/or the building.  Then he will make a proposition--get him a 'drink' and he will let you in.  He will even tell you how to get the 'libation'.  You'll have to get it from Brockwood's!

- BROCKWOOD'S

Then you go into Brockwood's Store--he will take your backpack--don't worry, you won't need it here, and you'll get it back once you leave.  Go northwest to the Fitting Room.  Look in the mirror there--push the mirror, then voila, you can enter the back room (the locked door in the sales area leads to it, but you can't use that door).  There is a desk there, with a waste basket next to it.  You'll need to get into the large drawer, this is where Brockwood hides his booze.  (By the way, I encourage you to look at everything that seems interesting in this game!)  Look in the waste basket for the key.  Read the ledger that's in the drawer--to feel better about stealing his gin.  For an interesting excursion, try sitting in the swivel chair, and SPIN CHAIR.  You'll get the key to the hatch in the ceiling, to get on the roof--this will remind you of the trampoline that is there, and the location of the Red Shirt.  Though you don't really need anything up here.  Now go back down through the Fitting Room and into the store, with the gin bottle--surprisingly, Brockwood will allow you to leave with his bottle--he's really trying to give it up.

- THE BAIT AND SWITCH

But really, you have no intention of giving a bottle of real gin to an alcoholic.  The game won't let you!  You'll have to make Walter 'think' that it's real gin.  From Brockwood's Front, go south then west to Business Parking, then northwest to Brockwood's Nook--there's a water tap there.  POUR OUT the gin bottle, then TURN ON WATER TAP, and FILL BOTTLE WITH TAP.  Don't worry about opening or closing the bottle, that's automatic.  Then go back to Walter in Vestibule (SE, E, E, E, N) and give him the bottle.  He'll assume it's real because you obviously got it from Brockwood, he won't ask questions, he'll leave, giving you his nametag.  You can now enter the building, but there's one more item you'll need--go back out to Gravel Lot, go NE, and pick up the lantern there.  Now turn it on and you have light.  Now go through the Vestibule into the Cluttered Passage, you'll find the roll of duct tape and a newspaper page--which you'll want to look at (please take all take-able items, they will all fit in the backpack).

- THE SCIENCE LESSON

As you go into the Auditorium, you'll notice a hatch way up in the ceiling--it's open!  If you guessed that your Red Shirt is on the roof beyond this hatch, you're correct!  You'll need to figure out how to get up there.  The key is LEVERAGE.  The newspaper page gives some clue--you're going to put together something that will help you get up there--if only to get your shirt.  Try some things--turn on the spigot, turn it off, turn on the 'engine', turn it off--just to get a 'feel' of what you're about to do (Don't worry, Walter won't come back until after you 'do your thing' here, no matter how long it takes)--already there is what is called an Archimedean Screw, this is your base power source.  Now, go west into the Dim Front--you'll find a scaffold, examine it--better yet, look at it through the binoculars.  Now PUSH SCAFFOLDING EAST. The scaffolding has a yardstick on top, with a 5-gallon bucket tied to the end, and it's held down up there by a statue--a precarious balance--try to think of what would throw this balance off?  LEVERAGE.  Fill that bucket, and the statue will topple.  What can fill it--because you cannot reach it--??  The engine.  You'll need to PUSH SCAFFOLDING TO ENGINE.

So, how could the statue toppling be useful to you??  You could PUSH SEESAW TO SCAFFOLDING--but there's one more thing.  You might not get enough LEVERAGE to vault you through the hatch (and yes, you are going to be on the seesaw). TURN CRANK CW(or CLOCKWISE)--try both directions to get a 'feel' for how it works.  What happens?  A bathtub appears, suspended by a chain.  Look at it, better yet with the binocs.  You'll find that if you turn the crank CW, the bathtub gets nearer to the engine--CC(or COUNTERCLOCKWISE) makes it go the other direction.  You'll want the tub to be next to the scaffolding, so TURN CRANK CW until the tub almost buts up against the scaffolding.  Let the messages guide you.  Your final addition will be the seesaw--PUSH SEESAW TO STAGE EDGE--you don't want it to be directly under the tub.

Now, all you have left to do is put some energy through this system.  And you--the Artist--are going to be the vital fifth element.  Get your stuff together--everything in the backpack, close it up, put it on your back, put the staff through the straps.  You won't need the lantern beyond this room, so you can drop it here.  Now turn on the spigot, turn on the engine--you have a generous five moves to get on the seesaw.

Now let it sing!

If all went well, you are back in Kitchen--having gone through the hatch--but not before seeing Walter charge back in--snatched your Red Shirt, crossed the street (albeit in the air), bounced off of the trampoline and through your own back window.  You've come full-circle!  Don't worry about the police that are now in that Gravel Lot (Walter called them), just avoid it.  You'll get thrown in jail anyway, which will be part of this journey, but I'd rather you do that part last (but if you want to go ahead and do it, go to the Gravel Lot or the police station and get yourself arrested by either having Walter's nametag on you or giving the nametag to the sergeant at the station--then skip ahead to BOB AND ROGER, and come back when done).

You can continue exploring, but you won't be able to get anywhere without interacting with Jerry, the Barber.  So---

JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT

If you're wondering why he is groping around, you can either look at the pictures on the walls, or in the hallway to the east of his Shop area--or just ASK JERRY ABOUT GLASSES.  He'll tell you that he tripped on the curb and they fell off and 'bounced off somewhere'.  Go to Corner Curb and look in the grating--that's where the glasses are.  Jerry is a bit self-absorbed, so you're going to have to figure this one out without his (conscious) help.  Your utility key will not help you open the grating--you're going to need something sharper or flatter.  You may have noticed the screwdriver in the barber chair..??  Of course, you can't just take the screwdriver in the presence of its possible owner, so you'll have to engage in a little subterfuge.  GET IN BARBER CHAIR--you'll automatically put down your backpack and other stuff.  You'll be surprised when Jerry pulls out your White Shirt(!), using it as a bib.  You'll have to play along here, because you won't be able to just take the shirt just now, Jerry is a bit stubborn.  Let him cut your hair, but while you are on the chair, TAKE SCREWDRIVER.  When he's finished, you'll be out of the chair again and you'll need to give him the $10 bill--declining the $2 change as a courtesy to him (you won't need it).  Then go to Corner Curb and PRY GRATING WITH SCREWDRIVER.  Then open it and take the glasses.  Play around with them for a while if you want, but they are useless to you--and the world to Jerry.  Give them to him, and you get--a ticket to Bunco Springs Amusement Park(BSAP), down the street.  But not your shirt...

Go east from the shop, into the bathroom, if you haven't already.  There is a sheet in the hole in the ceiling--you'll see it when you LOOK UP.  It's the source of the draft.  You'll need to get this sheet down.  Neither the sink nor the toilet are sturdy enough to stand on, so you'll have to get on the shelf--with the towel bar to hold on to.  Take the magazine off of the shelf, then take the towel--you'll need something to replace the sheet with--then GET ON SHELF.  Now take the sheet and see what it really is.  It's a barber bib!  Now put the towel in the hole--you will automatically spread the towel over the hole.  Now you can go back into the shop area and give the towel to Jerry.  Now he's a happy camper!  Plus, seeing his error, he gives you your shirt back!  Now you have your White Shirt.  And you're ready for the park!

THE PARK

You can do more exploring again, if you want.  If you go to the Demolished Building further south past the park, you'll see a yellow streamer hanging from the flagpole.  Using the binocs, once again, you discover it's your Yellow Shirt!  You won't be able to get it, yet, because you don't yet have the means to do so, however the sign in front of the building gives you a clue.  Now you should focus on the park, and what you CAN do.  Remember the suggestion about getting your spirits up and perhaps a ride will do the trick...??  Though you are supposed to be 'afraid of heights', but now you are so depressed that you don't care.  Anyway, go in through the Amusement Park Entrance, and give the ticket to Chester in the ticket trailer.  Feel free to get to know Chester and how much of a jerk he is.  You can do some exploring around the park, and even see the demolished building from another angle, at the end of the 'nature path'--go into the hole in the tower, go up the stairs--you'll see the Thinker, and the skylight up top--that's where the flagpole is rooted.  You won't be able to open this skylight or remove it, but tuck it away in your memory.

And be careful not to leave the park until after you get results--and you'll know it when you've done it.

If you tried to get on the roller-coaster, you'll notice no one is there to start the ride, you won't be able to start it, so nix the idea for now.  Really, the only other ride is the Wonder Wheel, manned by our friend Rex.  If you're feeling really sneaky, go to his car in the parking lot and LOOK IN REX'S CAR--you'll get a white paper bag--there's some stale popcorn in it so he won't mind..?? (In fact, if you don't take the bag, and you do the Wonder Wheel, he'll leave for lunch in his car, leaving the bag behind.)  Feel free to ask Rex about anyone you've met so far, even about important things.  Ask him about the duck, in fact ask him about the popcorn.  Ask Rex about himself.  Now have your binoculars in hand--or wear them--so he can see them--then GET INTO WHITE CAR--he'll see your binocs and tell you he'll stop the wheel once you get up top--this is crucial, as it's an important vantage point, and you'll get only one chance to do this.  Once he stops the wheel, you'll notice something--what's that clinging to the nearer loop on the roller-coaster??  LOOK AT BLUE SPLOTCH WITH BINOCULARS--that's your Blue Shirt!!  You'll have 6 moves to do this before the wheel starts up again, and you are back on ground level.  Feel free to use the remaining time to look at other things around you, with the binocs.

Now, you can go to the Kiddie Pond, and give the popcorn to the duck--he gives you a gift.  TAKE ROCK.  Perfect for throwing.  You'll realize its use when you get on the Crock Blocker!

When you are on the platform for the Blocker, you have six cars to choose from.  This is important--if you get on the wrong car, too far forward, you won't be able to catch your shirt as it floats by when you are doing the second loop.  In fact, if you get on the yellow car, you're doomed, because the bar on it is loose--avoid it (devilish grin)--get on the rear car, #6.  Don't forget to DROP your stuff before getting into the car.  Now when you are in the car, throw the rock at the green lever, and let the ride begin!  You won't have to type a command, just let the ride do its thing, you've made the important choices and now just sit and enjoy.  You'll catch your Blue Shirt near the end of the ride.

But you won't be able to rest yet...

Hear the ticking noise..??

SEARCH CONTROL BOOTH.  Now you have an incendiary device in the shape of a pipe.  Time is important here.  Don't worry about the whats and whys now, you'll need to put the pipe where it won't be of any danger to anyone, but perhaps more importantly, where it would be of use to you.  In fact, I encourage you to play around with it, have some fun, try giving it to people, etc etc.  Take advantage of SAVE and RESTORE.  You have 20 moves to get this right.  Think back carefully about where this device might be of use.  Seen any demolished buildings lately??

And have you been in the tower?  Third floor?

More crucially, remember your Yellow Shirt?? It's on the flagpole at the top of the tower.  You'll need to get this --shall I say, bomb--up there.  You'll need to somehow attach it to the skylight, so it will work properly--just leaving it in the room won't be effective enough.  Got the tape?  PUT TAPE ON PIPE.  Now, PUT PIPE ON SKYLIGHT--it will stick.  Now, high-tail it out of there, fast!

BOOOMMM...

Now, you've got 15 moves to do this right....and pay attention to what goes on, particularly after the bomb goes off...if you don't see these things, you won't know why you'll need to do certain things, particularly Chester's movements, and the hawk that flies over--you'll see all this if you are back in the park in time to hear the blast from there. Chester will run out of the trailer to get a look, and at the same time, a hawk will fly over, with 'something yellow' in its beak.  You'll see the hawk deposit it on top of the trailer, realizing it to not be food.  Chester meanwhile will run to his car to contact--the police?--on his wireless.  You'll need to get into the trailer and do 2 things--1) get your shirt from out of the skylight, and 2) develop evidence against Chester, because he's certainly got a leg up on you.

First thing's first--you won't be able to get into the trailer from the front window.  You'll have to go to the back of it, via BSAP Parking(go SE from there, or S from Main Exit).  Look under the trailer for the key.  Unlock the door there and you are in.  Your Yellow Shirt is there in the skylight--take it.  Now look at what Chester has left behind--particularly the notebook.  Read it.  Now take it.  Now get out of there, and wait for the police to show up.

You'll figure out that Chester has opportunistically framed you for the explosion--you would have been accused whether you set the bomb or not.  His diary is your proof that he set that bomb, intending for it to go off after the first ride on the Blocker.  With his diary in hand, you'll be exonerated for this felony, and let go, with your Yellow and Blue Shirts.  But if you have the nametag on you--Walter's--they will arrest you and put you in jail for the destruction of the other building (unless you've already gotten yourself arrested--if so, and you 'got results', skip ahead to NAP TIME.  Otherwise, read on).

On the other hand, if you don't have the diary, the game will end with you being thrown into the Big Clink--not the one at the police station.

THE DRUNK TANK

Yep, you're in the 'pokey'.  Walter has got his revenge.  There's nothing you can do here, essentially, except talk--but you have another 20 moves to do it in.  Get a look at your cell mates.  You'll find that only one is really sleeping.  Look at the one in the blue jacket.  He's lying awake.  Look at his jacket.  You may wonder why he is clutching his jacket and shaking.  Is it DTs??  ASK BLUE MAN ABOUT ANXIETY.  He'll loosen up--then you get a surprise!  Your Green Shirt pops out!

But you won't be able to get it right away.  It seems to hold some meaning for him.  You'll need to verbally give him some proof that you should have the shirt.  TELL BLUE MAN ABOUT RED SHIRT(or any other shirt you've already gotten--you'll automatically tell him about Natalie and missing all of the shirts, etc).  How hard was that?  Now you can use the remaining time to get to know Bob and his friend, ask him some questions, about people and things, in the cell, etc.  When the time is up, you'll all be escorted out of the cell and back into town.  You'll see Bob and Roger again, in action, so to speak.

You can return to town by going north from here.  If you have all the shirts, read on from here.  If you got only the Green and Red Shirts, go back to JERRY AND THE WHITE SHIRT.  If you got only the Green, Red and White Shirts, go back to THE PARK.

If you have gotten all the shirts, you'll be prompted to go home and take a nap.  Follow the messages and clues once you get there.  This is where we segue into what is essentially Part II of the game.

NAP TIME

Go to Natalie's room and GET ON NATALIE'S BED, because you'll want to feel closer to her--and, you've always wanted to know how comfortable her bed is.  Read all the clues.  When you wake up, you'll see her diary(!) laying on the bed next to your head.  Don't worry, it'll disappear only if you try to take it while off of the bed, or if you take it and then leave the bed--and it will reappear when you get back on the bed.  The only thing you need it for is for a password, and how and where to use it.  So READ DIARY.  You'll only see the words inside the front cover--pay attention--the 'magic word' will be one of five possible words, all beginning with 'f'--fooble, forsnook, finsteeth, frotzle or frachet--it was chosen at random at the start of the game, so it can be different if you restart at this point--you will not be able to use one of these words, even if you make the right choice, by chance, without first seeing it in the diary--if you try, you'll get a snarky response (but try it anyway).  And take her advice--remember to 'whisper' it.

THE SECRET ALCOVE 

Where is the alcove?  It's not her Nook out in the Living Room.  Remember the closet?  You'll have to have the light on and go deeper inside it.  Now, WHISPER (the magic word you found in the diary).  Surprise!  Go into that area.  Now look around, do whatever you want, look at the cards, learn about tarot.  Pick up the card on top of the deck.  Look at the cards in the spread.  You don't have to do these things, but I encourage you to read and explore.  Really, the important thing here is the mojo.  In fact, while you are here, if you listen long enough, Natalie's voice will spell out your next mission--find her and bring her mojo to her!!  Take the mojo, then step back out.

THE INVITATION

As soon as you step back into her room, you'll hear something like an engine running outside, and knock at the door.  Answer it.  YOU got a package, for a change.  But also, the mail has arrived.  Take the black box, and then go check your mailbox.  You'll have to sift through the junk mail 3 times before finding the important thing--it's an invite to your boss's party--TODAY.  And you'll need to go in your dress shoes--which you haven't got yet (they're on the list!).  But you decide that they'll have to take you in your office shoes, so put them on.  Wonder what's in the box??  Open it and look into it!  AHH!  Natalie's been KIDNAPPED.  That is, if you haven't already figured this out.  You'll notice some other strange things about this box/sphere.  It seems to tug you in certain directions.  Follow that.  It'll take you down Lookout Avenue--and while you're going down there, feel free to explore and look at things.  You're going to be late, anyway, so take your time.  Examine Mabel Maybre's--your landlady's--mansion across the street from you, take a walk down the street, go on the south side.  Look at the end of the street, past your boss's house--particularly the property with the small house, fenced in.  Now go to the party...

THE PARTY

When you arrive, finally, you'll see most of your co-workers leaving--you don't need them.  Go up and knock on the door.  If you have your invitation--and the office shoes on--you'll be grudgingly admitted, don't worry, this is the only possible way to get in.  Now you can spend all the time you want talking--or trying to talk--to John, Rick, Scottie, look around, etc., but at one point Scottie will be prompted to leave, and John goes upstairs for a nap.  You can spend all the time you want doing whatever you want, but what you should do is first go into the dining room where Richard is, and read the note on the counter.  John found some shoes, and had them thrown to the dog.  Were they yours??  In any case, you feel resentful.

Indulge your curiosity.  When John went upstairs, he left the rope detached.  So go on up!  Don't worry, his wife cannot stay in one place very long, she won't catch you or notice you.  Follow the snoring.  Now you're in John's room.  Stay quiet.  Look in the closet--gotcha!  Look at things.  You'll need to take two things--really three--the key from the drawer in the nightstand, and John's shoes.  Yep, John's shoes.  Be quiet about it!

Now go back down and onto the patio.  What do we do with the shoes??  Remember the note on the counter??  Now do unto John as he has done unto whoever those shoes belonged to.  Could be you, maybe not.  But be careful not to throw them directly at Ruffy.  You see, the sphere is pulling towards the doghouse, and you want to go in there without Ruffy knowing.  So you want to distract him a little.  Is there a tree, or a fence, in the other direction??  THROW JOHN'S SHOES AT TREE, or THROW JOHN'S SHOES OVER SHORT FENCE.  He'll get right after them.

Now the party's over for you, you must now go into the doghouse--you can look around there if you want, but you have 5 moves to unlock the gate with the key you found in John's room--or face Ruffy.  Look at the 'mass' you find there--take it for the points.  Now go--go south, then take the curious object you find on the ground nearby.  You're now at the vacant property next door--if you explored around the Raditch House before you came to the party, you'll realize that this is the house that was fenced in.  The sphere tugs you strongly in this direction, then breaks from your grasp and busts against the cellar doors outside the house, as you approach.

Obviously, you should go down in there...

NATALIE...??

You find Natalie tied into a chair in this cellar.  But not too tightly, as you find out, if you try to cut her bonds--with the strange 'handle'--which is a switchblade (aren't they illegal now?).  You can take the bandanna out of her mouth, and then UNTIE NATALIE.  You'll find out that she's not too conversational--time is of the essence.  What was your mission?  To give her the mojo.  So do it!

But you just can't....

You can try.  In fact, you can try three times.  Or not.

Either way, about 15 or so moves after you free her, you'll find out that she's really...

MABEL!  Your landlady!  And she becomes a giant bird!

And that the small house and cellar were just a mirage!

Before you have any time to think, Mabel flies up and takes you with her.  Why couldn't she just take the mojo??  Because it would reject her grasp.  But there's something about that she NEEDS, and it needs to be willingly given to her by its owner--which is the REAL Natalie.

LOCKED UP, AGAIN?

You wake up in a jail cell, tied--this time much more tightly--to a chair, bolted to the floor.  In a dark, mildewy jail cell underground.  You cannot do anything, you cannot get up.  But wait, what is that in your back pocket (assuming that you did pick up that strange 'handle' back at the vacant property?)??  Push the little button on the handle in the back pocket--it's a switchblade!  Cut the ropes with it.  Now you can get up--to find out that the cell door isn't locked.  You can now leave the cell and go west into the main area--but also collect all of your things from the dungeon alcove just beyond the cell.  Don't worry, all Mabel is interested in is the mojo, which you are still wearing because she cannot take it off of you.  Is this a dungeon, or is it a gym??  Because you see all this exercise equipment laying around.  You'll find out for sure about 15 moves from the time you entered the Exercise Room before Mabel comes down to toture you--and the game ends. Try some of it out, if you want, but what you want to do is open the 'steam bath' and pick up the alabaster key from the floor inside it.  You'll need it later.  If you want some laughs, SAVE your position, and try some of the other equipment!

Now what you have left to do, here, is leave through the hatch overhead.  Now you are at Base of Mountain--pick up the plastic stick that you find there, it's a phosphorescent light stick--BREAK STICK for a light source.  You'll need to go east over to the oak tree fast--you have 5 moves from the time you emerged from the hatch before Mabel spots you.  Once you get to the tree, you won't have to worry about Mabel again--for now.

NIGHTSCAPE

Now from Tree Base, the only way you can go is UP.  You can wear the light stick on your wrist, and put everything you have in your backpack, wear it, and then WEAR STAFF (in case you haven't yet found out, the staff can be slid through the straps and worn in this way).  Now go UP the tree.  You are immediately presented with three branches going in northerly directions--north, northeast and northwest.  Which one is correct??  You can try them if you want.  But look around.  There is a hollow behind you--look into it!  There, you find a leather whip!  Read the tag--'From the One That Got Away'.

Also, there's another branch--overhead.  SWING WHIP AT STRONG BRANCH.  Then SWING ON WHIP.  Bombs away!!

Your way from here is pretty well cut and dried--you're on the other side of the fence, so you can follow the path around the mountain, and then into the cave--which is a tunnel that goes into the heart of the mountian.  Now go into the door--after picking up the piece of paper lying there.  Now you are in a strange place...

BLACK AND WHITE

This is just an abstract piece of interactive fiction that I decided to write into the game...

Now you are in the center of a perfectly white room with a huge black dot--there is even a sign indicating where you are!  If that's not enough, the piece of paper you have also has a huge black dot--this is a map, of sorts, showing you where you are.  Again, you can walk around, examine, explore all you want.  Use the white key that you got from the exercise room to unlock the white door, go into the room with the desk and examine the huge book that you find there--it's a ponderous tome written by Rene Decartes.  What is perhaps his most famous saying?  'I think, therefore I am'.  So we come to the one thing you need to do here.  Think.  But you need to do this in the right place.  Go where you feel most 'centered'--on The Dot.  Now--guess.  

THINK.

ON THE MOUNTAIN

Now you are on the terrace near the top of North Mountain.  Don't worry about getting off the mountain or back where you were.  And don't worry--yet--about Mabel.  Examine the fire--what's in it?  You have about 5-7 moves to take your nametag from the flames.  That's the last thing on your list!  You get the points.  Put the nametag on, because it's an important identity symbol.  Now you can look around and examine things there on the terrace.  Specifically, examine the hole on the side--what do you notice just over the side, near the hole?  A cave entrance, on a lower level.  You'll need to get down there.  How?  It's a precarious climb, and there are no hand-holds.  Seven symbols of your identity will be needed to help you climb down there.  You're already wearing one--the nametag--as a sort of bolster to your courage.  Now, what do you have that can fit into the hole?

Your staff.  PUT STAFF IN HOLE.

Now, you're going to have to make a rope--with the remaining five things.

The shirts.  It doesn't matter what order you tie them in, you can do it this way--TIE RED SHIRT TO WHITE SHIRT.  TIE BLUE SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE YELLOW SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  TIE GREEN SHIRT TO SHORT ROPE.  Or however.

Now you have a long rope.  Obivously, you can TIE ROPE TO STAFF.  Voila!

Remember to be wearing your nametag before you go.  Now, DOWN....

You are now in front of the cave entrance, on a narrow ledge.  The only way to go is into the entrance, south.

You find--NATALIE!--but she's lying down with her hands tied.  She notices you--listen to her--she IS the real Natalie.  Cut her bonds with the switchblade--you won't be able to untie the leather string.

Another surprise!  (And don't worry, you did everything correctly up to here.)

Now you have TWO Natalies!  Is this a good thing??  No, because one of them is Mabel!

Now ask either one of them anything!  Try anything!  Have fun!  You won't be able to tell which one is which, no matter what you do or ask--but listen to what they say.  The crucial thing is knowing which one to give the mojo to.  After about 20 moves from the time you freed the real Natalie, one of them will say something interesting.  Remember the 'magic word' from earlier?  She will say that word, to which the other will say 'Oh bullhockey, honey, don't listen to her!  She's nuts!'  Which ever one, the Natalie on the left, or the Natalie on the right, that said the 'magic word' is the one that you should give the mojo to!  (Like the magic word, which Natalie is the correct one is not necessarily the same in each complete game playing.)  Now watch the pyrotechnics!

GETTING HOME

Natalie has now flown you both back down to the ground, but beyond that point, she is not exactly going to hold your hand on the way home.  Really there is only one route you can go--she will not let you turn back.  Listen to her as you pass the Goblins, Inc. shop--an important suggestion.  You are now on Center Street--but now it's night time and you are heading south to the corner at Rex's--you've been here before, but just during the day when it wasn't so active.  Now turn west--you are now at the Alley Entrance, again.  You see two pairs of feet sticking out of the alley--EXAMINE FEET, for another surprise!  It's your two buddies from the jail cell!  Natalie looks none too patient, but she'll need to wait for a bit, because this is a very important encounter--a key conversation.  You have 20 moves to tell them about the right things.

They want to know how your quest is going.  Now TELL BOB ABOUT one of the following--Natalie, Mabel, the kidnapping, the shirts, the rescue.

Bob will then 'confer with his cohort' and in moments, this results in him donating their jackets to you and Natalie.  You get Bob's jacket, because, with your bald pate, you look more like him, and Natalie gets Roger's jacket--and she gets the fedora--with her hanging on your neck, this makes you two look like the two of them, with Bob toting Roger to their lodgings for the night, at the apartments.

Now all you have to do is get home.  Literally.  Continue west to Lookout Avenue Apartments, go south into the gate, and go back to the apartment.  Your disguise fools the giant bird hovering around the mountain to the north, until the hat blows off of Natalie--just as you get inside the gate.  Then Mabel spots her and as the two of you start running, the gate begins to close.  Crazy Mabel doesn't notice this, as intent as she is, and just as she swoops down, the gate closes!  Game over for her!

And for you.

Thank you for playing my game, and as the ending says, look out for 'Bullhockey 2!"

At the time of the walkthrough creation, this game could be played at

Since actions are timed, you have 20 seconds between run or jump
actions; if you don't take one of these actions every 20 seconds, you'll
freeze to death. So if you're a slow typist, you may want to add "jump"
as needed.

Het doel van het spel is om een grote schat te vinden.

Het verhaal  begint in je eigen huis. Daar kun je een briefje 
oppakken. In het briefje staat hoe je de commando's in kunt 
typen. Als je door het raam klimt, zul je de schep vinden. Als 
je naar je slaapkamer gaat, zul je een kleine, brandende 
lantaren vinden. Het is ook mogelijk om een tukje in je bed te 
doen. Verder is hier nu nog niets te doen, dus ga weer terug 
naar de kamer. In het oosten is een hal, waar een sneetje 
brood, een fles melk en een munt liggen. Ook staat er een 
mooie houten kist. Als je de kist beter bekijkt, zul je een 
vreemde inscriptie ontdekken. Misschien is het handig als je 
die inscriptie even opschrijft. Misschien ook niet.

Nu kun je je huis verlaten en naar buiten gaan. Je staat dan 
midden in het dorp, en je ziet de herberg en in de verte een 
groot, eng kasteel. Ga de herberg binnen. Ga zitten en luister. 
Je zult een aantal gasten horen praten. Luister dan nog een 
keer en de gasten zullen opstaan en ergens anders gaan zitten. 
Als je weer bent gaan staan, wil je natuurlijk de knoflook 
hebben. Maar je mag het niet pakken van de waard! De oplossing 
is dat je intypt "koop knoflook". Dan zal de waard het gewoon 
aan je geven. Typ dan "vraag waard" en hij zal je een trap 
naar de zolder laten zien. Ga naar de zolder. Daar tref je een 
kist aan die onder het stof zit. Blaas het stof weg, en er 
komt een oud boek te voorschijn. In dit boek staat hoe je 
vampiers kunt doden. Bekijk de rare steen ook eens goed... Je 
kunt ook het bloed op de grond onderzoeken, maar daar wordt je 
niet veel wijzer van. Ga weer naar beneden in de herberg. Als 
je in een agressieve bui bent, kun je de waard in elkaar 
slaan, maar na een paar keer zal hij je doden en moet je 
opnieuw beginnen. Daarom is het handig als je het spel even 
opslaat voordat je hem gaat slaan. Dit doe je door 'bewaar 
spel' in te tikken. In de herberg is nu voorlopig niets meer 
te doen, dus we gaan naar het bos.

Als je weer buiten staat, ga dan het bos in. Nu moet je even 
ronddwalen (ga west, ga noord etc.) tot je bij een boomhut 
komt. Hier kun je de voetafdrukken bekijken, en dan in de boom 
klimmen. In de hut zul je een kapmes en een houten wig vinden. 
Ga weer omlaag, en probeer voor de grap eens in de boom te 
snijden.

Ga dan het bos weer uit door weer op goed geluk allerlei 
richtingen op te lopen. Nu gaan we maar eens een kijkje nemen 
in het kasteel!!

Als je het bos weer uit bent, ga dan naar het noorden en naar 
het kasteel. Als je een andere richting neemt, kom je weer in 
het bos. Als je voor het kasteel staat, kun je de tekst boven 
de ingang lezen en dan naar binnen gaan. Binnen zul je een 
harnas aantreffen. Als je erin wilt kruipen, moet je "trek 
harnas" intypen. Als je daarna "kijk vizier" typt, zul je 
vreemde dingen zien. Trek het harnas dan weer uit, want je 
kunt er nu nog niet mee bewegen. Je kunt het wel meenemen, 
maar laten staan voor later is ook goed. Je kunt namelijk 
maar een beperkt aantal spullen meedragen. Je moet dus goed 
opletten waar je dingen laat, zodat je ze later weer kunt 
ophalen als je ze nodig hebt. 

Er is hier een deur, maar als je daar door loopt, kom je in 
een kamer waar verder niets is te doen. Er is hier alleen 
een lange tafel met etensresten. Ga de kamer uit, en loop de 
trap op. Je staat voor slaapkamer 2, maar de deur is niet 
open te krijgen. Als je naar het westen gaat, kom je bij 
slaapkamer 1. Als je die ingaat, kun je naar een balkon. Als 
je daar van af springt, ben je dood. Ga slaapkamer 1 weer 
uit, en loop weer naar het oosten. Je bent dan weer bij 
slaapkamer 2. Ga nu de nauwe gang zuidwaarts in. Je kunt 
hier verschillende kanten op. Als je de wenteltrap omhoog 
gaat, kom je in de kasteeltoren. Hier is een kist met een 
gesloten luik. Nu kun je die nog niet openen. Ga door het 
raam en je zult een waterbron in de verte zien. Vanaf nu kun 
je bij die waterbron komen in het bos. Ga weer omlaag en dan 
nog een keer omlaag. Je staat nu voor een geheimzinnige deur, 
waarop gebonkt wordt. Ook deze deur kun je nu nog niet 
openen. Als je weer omlaag gaat, kom je op de begraafplaats. 
Als het goed is, is hier een lange ladder. Neem die mee. Je 
kunt eventueel nog door het poortje gaan, om bij de graven 
te kijken. Ga weer door het poortje en ga omhoog. Ga nogmaals 
omhoog en zet dan de ladder neer, die zal tot het gat reiken. 
Klim de ladder op en je bent in de spionageruimte. Ga naar 
het oosten. Je kunt nog verder naar het oosten, maar daar 
loopt de gang dood. Ga terug en ga door het gat omlaag. Je 
komt in een ventilatieruimte, waar je verder niets kunt doen. 
Ga weer omhoog en twee keer naar het westen. Ga dan omhoog de 
uitgehouwen trap op en kijk door het gat. Je zult Dracula 
zien die in een kist stapt. Als je nog een keer kijkt zie je 
een dichte kist staan. Klaarblijkelijk zit Dracula daar in, 
maar vergis je niet. Als je weer naar beneden gaat via de 
ladder zul je hem tegenkomen. Je kunt proberen hem te slaan, 
schoppen of doden, maar dat haalt niets uit. Hij zal je 
altijd doodbijten. Nee, de truc is dit: typ "schijn dracula", 
en gooi dan de knoflook. Dracula zal met een plof verdwijnen, 
maar hij is nog niet dood!

Neem de ladder mee en ga nu het kasteel weer uit, - let op! 
De deur valt nu dicht en kan niet meer open!- en ga naar het 
dorp. Je kunt nu naar de waterbron. Gooi de duivelaarsmunt 
in de waterbron, en vul de fles met het giftige, blauwe 
water dat nu is ontstaan. Je kunt de munt ook weer meenemen 
als je dat wilt. Als je behoefte hebt om nogmaals op de 
zolder van de herberg te kijken, dan kan dat. Maar de waard 
zal je er niet langs laten. Als je hem de munt geeft, wordt 
hij weer wat rustiger en kun je op zolder kijken. Hier is 
echter nog steeds niets te vinden. Ga weer naar je eigen 
huis en naar de slaapkamer. Als je nu gaat slapen, zul je 
midden in de nacht wakker worden door gebonk onder je bed. 
Schijn met de lamp onder je bed en je ziet een open luik 
zitten. Ga omlaag door het luik. Je zult een doosje en een 
bijl aantreffen. Open het doosje en je vind een hamer. Pak 
de bijl en ga weer omhoog. Ga naar het bos en zoek weer naar 
de boomhut. Hak nu met de bijl een stuk hout uit de boom, 
en raap dat op. Snij nu met het mes in het hout en het zal 
de vorm van een kruis krijgen. Je kunt voor de lol met de 
bijl ook huis gaan houden in de herberg. Als je de bijl 
gooit zal de waard hem weer terug smijten enz.

Ga weer naar je huis en zet de ladder neer onder het gat 
boven je. Beklim de ladder en pak het touw dat daar ligt. 
Ga weer omlaag, neem de ladder mee en ga naar je slaapkamer. 
Kruip weer door het luik onder je bed. Pak de hamer en 
graaf met de schep naar het noorden tot je op iets hards 
stoot. (De bijl heb je overigens niet meer nodig, evenals 
het mes, de lamp en de knoflook. Zorg dat je in ieder geval 
de hamer en de wig hebt, het touw en de fles met giftig 
water.) Duw  de steen weg en ga door het ontstane gat. Je 
bent nu weer in het kasteel en je stuit op de doodskist van 
Dracula. Open de kist en de klok zal twaalf uur slaan door 
je pc speaker. Dracula opent de ogen en zal wegvluchten. 
Typ nu telkens "volg dracula", totdat hij niet verder gaat 
en hij voor je komt staan. Tijdens je achtervolging zul je 
merken dat je nu wel door het luik kunt gaan van de kist, 
die eerst dicht zat. Je komt dan in slaapkamer 2 waar je 
eerst niet in kon. Maar goed, Dracula staat op het punt je 
weer aan te vallen. Als je de knoflook en de lamp nu zou 
gebruiken haalt het niets meer uit. Nee, nu moet je het 
houten kruis tonen. Dracula zal angstig tegen de muur 
opkruipen en de handen voor zijn ogen slaan. Sla dan de wig 
met de hamer door zijn hart en Dracula is dood!!!! Zijn 
lijk zal tot stof vervallen en je kunt nog net het woord 
'incoronium' lezen. Vergeet ook niet om de gouden halsband 
op te rapen die hier ergens ligt.

Ga nu naar de kamer waar stond "Dit is Sesam". Typ nu de 
toverspreuk in die het lijk van Dracula achterliet en de 
deur zal opengaan. Je komt nu oog in oog te staan met een 
gevaarlijke spin. Ook hier kun je proberen haar te doden maar 
dat lukt niet. Je moet de fles met giftig water kapot gooien. 
De spin zal dan het water opdrinken en sterven. Als je 
rondkijkt, zie je een vuur in deze kamer. Als je er doorheen 
loopt, ga je dood. Je zult het harnas aan moeten trekken. 
(Als je het niet bij je hebt, moet je het gaan halen) Je zult 
merken dat je je nu opeens wel kunt bewegen in het harnas. 
Loop door het vuur heen en je komt in de geheime schatkamer. 
Hier staat een kist vol met gouden munten. Als je de kist 
oppakt zal het kasteel gaan schudden en beven. Het wordt tijd 
dat je je uit de voeten gaat maken.

Als je weer terug bent gegaan door het vuur, moet je naar de 
plek waar de doodskist van Dracula stond. Gooi alle voorwerpen 
die je bij je hebt weg, en pak de doodskist op. Ga nu naar 
slaapkamer 1 en naar het balkon. Knoop daar het touw vast, ga 
omlaag via het touw en zet de doodskist neer. Kruip nu in de 
doodskist en je zal met kist en al van de heuvel afglijden, zo 
het dorp in. Als je weer uit de kist bent gestapt heb je het 
spel uitgespeeld. Je kunt nu gaan genieten van al je geld. 
Hoewel. Er lopen nog meer mannen rond in lange, zwarte 
jassen...

NB: Het is mogelijk bepaalde handelingen in een andere volgorde 
te doen, en voorwerpen op andere plaatsen te laten etc.

Walkthrough for "Dracula - Prince of Darkness" by Paul T. Johnson

Note, while this will get you from beginning to end, you'll need to do
considerably more EXAMINEs and LOOKs if you want to enjoy the full
effect of the game. Also, most of the timed puzzles are unforgiving of
any errors, so if you make a mistake, be sure to undo right away (or you
can wait to see the death first). Save frequently.

ZORK - aka DUNGEON - circa 1977, Mainframe (final version)
-------------------------------------------------------
GREAT WEBSITE:
http://zork3point2b.blogspot.com/2013/03/chapter-1-box-full-of-letters-wilco-1995.html
http://zork3point2b.blogspot.com/2013/11/appendix-4-this-song-george-harrison.html


FUN NOTES:
All purpose Gunk - fix leak in the dam from pushing the Blue Button
the Coffin - you can carry it out across the ravine and down the slide, or you can visit the room, and let the thief transport it all the way to his hideout - YEAH!  Turn the tables and make the thief work like a dog before you slit his throat. (After all, your crimes are quickly adding up:  trespassing, breaking&entering, stealing, killing, and probably caused massive flood destruction downriver too!)

This faux "Granite Wall" has no use...others might, but as the InvisiClues for Zork I stated, "Evidently the ancient Zorkers did not have strong truth-in-advertising laws. Take nothing for granite." 

Who is that Ugly Person staring back at me in the MIRROR room?
ARAGAIN Falls  -->  Backwards?  NIAGARA

Have you ever:
 - read lettering (in the Living Room)
 - look at blue cake through flask (and others)
 - eat the different cakes!
 - examine the portrait of Flathead, and the bills, coin, stamp
 - try digging with the shovel in the bat guano 
 - try to keep digging on the sandy shore
 - get in the barrel and say "GERONIMO" over the falls
 - wave stick again while walking on the rainbow
 - try to take the bat
 - walk into stinky room with torch
 - the water can also be used to cool the bell if you need to ring it again
 - examine stamp (Balloon area)
 - try floating to the top of the volcano
 - read the card after detonating explosives
 - look into any sphere (after you've put all 3 in the case!!)
 - IF YOU DIE... maybe pray at an altar for forgiveness?
 - in the temple... you can go to the treasure room:  TREASURE
 - opened the grating from beneath while the leaves were still on it?
 - tried swearing?
 - tried anything mean to the bodies in Hades?
 - burned the black book?
 - damaged the painting?
 - lit the candles with the torch?
 - read the matchbook?
 - play violin / play violin with sword
 - tried to take yourself (or the Thief, Troll, or Cyclops)?
 - tried cutting things with the knife or sword?
 - poured water on something burning?
 - said WAIT or SCORE or PRAY while dead (as a spirit)?
 - count (blessings, matchbook, candles, leaves, bills)
 - examine me
 - brush teeth
 - brush teeth with gunk (open tube and take gunk)
 - oil sword with water
 - make wish (at top of barrel with coins in hand)
 - attack cretin with sword
 - poke cyclops
 - send for brochure after you already get the stamp
 - burn brick, leaves, wire, bills
 - JUMP (from top of well)
 - kick the bucket (ie. the well)  haha
 - attack master with sword (ENDGAME)
in DREARY ROOM
  > look through window  
    The door is open, dummy.
 
Words you may not have tried:
  HELLO (by itself, and also to Cretin, Troll, Thief, Cyclops and objects)
  OIL (lubricate)
  XYZZY
  PLUGH
  ZORK
  DUNGEON
  SKIP
  FIND (especially with house, hands, teeth, cretin, grue)
  CHOMP
  COUNT (treasure, blessings, matchbook candles, leaves, bills)
  WIN

  MUMBLE (or SIGH)
  REPENT
  YELL (or SCREAM)
  SMELL

  NOOBJ
  FOO
  BAR

  BACK
  FROBOZZ
  SCHEDULE
  TIME
  DIAGNOSE

NOTE:  In some versions, the elvish sword can be referred to as "Glamdring" or "Orcrist"  

DON'T FORGET - type "score" once you get the full 616 points!

EXITS from UNDERGROUND:
1.  Trap Door (Cellar)
2.  Chimney  (Studio)
3.  Grating  (Maze - unlock with rusty keys)
4.  Pray     (Altar)
5.  Hole in Living Room Wall (Strange Passage)
6.  Over the Rainbow (Climb back up the Canyon)

LAMP BATTERIES:  Lasts about 325 turns

BALLOON RIDE:  The guidebook burns longest... otherwise you will need to burn a few different items (newspaper, leaflets, labels, brochures).

ENDING TEXT:
[Treasury of Zork] This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste. To judge from its contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.

There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.

In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and other informative and inspiring works.

On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground Empire, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure, and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.

On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.

As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon Master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things. Long have I waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!" He taps you lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells, and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped. For a moment there are two identical images staring at each other among the treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

Enchanted Castle (enchcast.zip)
----------------

You started in a medieval castle without any knowledge about it. You are to
escape the castle. There are three missions you might also want to do to
complete the wholestory of this beautiful text adventure game.

Walkthrough:
East: One of the torch is not firmly attached. Get it. This would be your
      only light source
West: Great Hall. There is a magic word written here. Some other areas
      would bring you back to here whenever this magic word is spoken.
      There are also other magic words. To distinguish it, we would refer
      this as return magic word.
Up,Up: There is a painting here.
      Try to get it. Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west
West: Prison cell
      There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them
      appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.
      You are trapped. But don't worry, you have the return magic word.
      so... You are back to Great Hall

Try to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,
and east where you can light it again. If you come to a place where there
is a sign "Abandon Ye..." on the west door then north, south, and west would
allow you to pass the west door. If you are ready then:

   menagerie, play oboe. You put him on sleep

   north (cruciform), east. There is a magic word that whenever is spoken
   somewhere else, everything there would be disappeared. So south, and say
   the magic word.

   you come to the nursery room, west. Notice the furnace? unlock it,
   open it, and you can get the Star
8. Exploring rooms behind hall of dragon
   Go to catacomb east of it. Southeast. Northeast. Keep trying to go to
   northeast until you found a bridge. Cross it. You would find a chained

   keys from you. Unless you have had the star of diamond, you won't need
   them anymore. East, north, west on the edge of a pit. Down. You entered
   a Zimbu house (This one too is just like the basilisk will be after you).

Walkthrough for A Very Hairy Fish-Mess
A Hideous Holiday Horror by Byron Alexander Campbell

This game was my attempt at a more traditional IF, with compass directions and puzzles to solve and plenty of ways to die.  It goes without saying that in this walkthrough I've included only the moves necessary to win, but experimentation should be rewarded, whether it's in the form of a funny response or a grisly death.  Taking and eating things are most likely to yield a unique response.  It's not supposed to be an unforgivingly hard game, but there may be a few rare parts where the puzzles are too opaque or the parser asks for too specific a command; if you run into this, you can curse my programming inexperience to the seventh generation, and hopefully this guide will help move things along.  Oh, and Merry Fishmas!

                              Walkthrough for

                            Getfeldt's Treasure

                             by Mike Salisbury

                           Written by Richard Bos


  First, some notes. 
  
  To start with, this is an MS-DOS game written in Quick Basic, and a port of
an original for the even earlier Tandy Color. This shows, sometimes badly.
Technically, the program is rather restrictive. There are no command recall
facilities, not even the ones used by the DOS command line. At least capitals
are accepted, but never significant. The most unpleasant lack, though, is that
you cannot save your game. At least it's not very long.
  As far as vocabulary is concerned, it has what it needs and nothing more.
Only the first three letters of a word are significant, except where they
aren't - see below. Some abbreviations are recognised, and some are required;
specifically, "east" is only recognised as a full word in "go east", not on its
own. You'll have to use "e". This one limitation is not very onerous, of
course. Also, you can't use "it".
  Another limitation is that this program is very bad for guess-the-verb. At
times, it even needs guess-the-exact-command. Synonyms are not common. "Get"
and "Take" will both work, and that's about it except where a special case has
been accounted for. But those pre-defined commands have their foibles, one of
which is is that they do not always recognise abbreviated words. Some work with
a three-letter abbreviation but not with a four-letter one. Some demand the
entire noun but allow the verb to be abbreviated; some do not. Using the entire
words in all commands would be best, which makes it all the more inconsistent
that "east" is not recognised on its own. And, of course, where I've used "the"
below to make the text read better, omit it.
  Those special cases have another problem: they are not accepted except in the
very circumstances for which they have been anticipated. Everywhere else they
will be treated as if you typed nonsense, or give a non-committal message such
as "nothing happens" where "that is not here" would be a more appropriate.
Similarly, "look object" and "read object" are not the same thing even where
they should be - in at least one case, "look object" says "nothing to be read",
but "read object" tells you what is written on it!
  Real bugs are, as far as I have found, rare. That is to say, bugs which
affect gameplay seem rare. You need to be careful not to lose your dog before
you get him - that seems to be all. Cosmetic bugs are much more common. One or
two messages seem incomplete, but the most common bug is that room descriptions
remain static when they shouldn't - objects remain in view when you take them,
that sort of thing. Misspelled words are also common.
  Finally, since this is a walkthrough, spoilers are rife below. I'm not taking
you past every single clue and sight - in fact, I'm not taking you past any.
All code numbers I'll be giving you can be found in the game somewhere. As
mentioned above, the Look and Read commands are not always helpful, but they do
occasionally reveal something useful. Therefore, look at everything before you
resort to this walkthrough, and if you accidentally read the solution to a
problem you hadn't come across yet, don't blame me.

  Now, let's go and get that treasure.  


  You start in Getfeldt's garden. Go east, take the crowbar, and go west and
south. Use the crowbar. (Yes, "use". Tsk, tsk... naughty implementor.) Drop the
crowbar. Open door, go east and north. Move the painting. You're asked for a
combination, which is 121513. Yes, a hint this can be found elsewhere in the
game. No, I'm not telling you where. Serves you right for reading walkthroughs.
Take and wear the amulet.
  Go s, s, e. Open the refrigerator ("fridge" is not recognised) and take the
steak. Go east. Now (and you must enter this as one command, nor will you be
allowed to proceed until you do) "give steak". Get the treats, and give treat.
If you now check your inventory, you'll find that you are carrying the dog!
  Pull the lever and go down. Take the gear and the balloon. Go east twice.
Unlock the door - the code is 6603243e. Go east twice more, then north and up.
Start the engine and set the navigation. You'll be asked for the coordinates,
which are 121.15.09:34.09.12 - and you've already come across these, although
I haven't told you explicitly where to find them. 
  Go east twice. Wear your gear, then go down and north. First turn the wheel,
then the handle. Go east. Close the door, and when asked which, enter /~\I
(slash, tilde, backslash, single I: the "one" version of the visible door's
"two"). Now "push green". Do not "push green pad" - that doesn't work. Turn
the cross.
  Go east, look shelf, take batteries, go east, take flashlight. Go south. Put
batteries in flashlight. Drop the flashlight, batteries (yes, you have to drop
them individually even though you just put them in the flashlight), balloon,
gear and treats. Go west. Put amulet in star, get chest, go east. No, all your
stuff hasn't disappeared. It's still here, it's just not shown in the room
description.
  Take the gear and balloon - leave the rest. Go back n, w, w. Take the net.
Wear the gear. Close the door - enter /~\II, that is, slash, tilde, backslash,
double I - push red and go west. Put chest in net. Attach net. You'll be asked
"to what" - enter "ring", as a single word. Don't ask me why this command could
not be handled in the same way as "put object in object", but if you try that,
you get told to "slow down". Pull the tab.


  Hooray - you have beaten Getfeldt. Although there are messages spread around
the game which make it uncertain how much you've actually "beaten" him and how
much of it was his idea all along. In any case, you're now rich, so no matter
who was the mastermind, it counts as a victory for you!(version 1.0 of this walkthrough -- 11/12/03)

WALKTHROUGH FOR GHOST TRAIN
                -----------

_Ghost Train_, by Paul Johnson, is available at

http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/ghost.z8

(you may need to watch for line breaks in the above URL)

This file is a little discursive, including some actions which are not
necessary to complete the game. However, they should make the experience
more enjoyable. The exact phrases you will need to type into the
interpreter are in ALL CAPS.

This walkthrough is based on
Release 4 / Serial number 070503 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 


ON THE FIRST TRAIN
------------------

Basically your goal is to wait around a few turns. READ NEWSPAPER, TALK
TO INGRID, KISS INGRID, and be sure to X INGRID. She's wearing a
necklace; X NECKLACE. You can take INVENTORY and X TICKET too. Whatever
you do, after a few turns there will be an accident.

AFTER THE ACCIDENT
------------------

Now you're in "blackness. A sleepy unconscious state." You want to WAKE.

Look at the wreckage! No, really, LOOK AT WRECKAGE. You can X BODIES, X
DEBRIS, SEARCH BODIES, and SEARCH DEBRIS too, but it won't get you
anything nifty. Instead go SOUTH. (You could go north, but it would only
take you to an endless set of tracks, so why bother?) X LIGHT and X BOX
here, then go WEST, UP, and WEST again to enter the signal box. You'll
see a ghostly train go by beneath you, but you don't have to worry about
it.

Well, you were looking for a phone, so X PHONE and it tells you how to
use it. TURN HANDLE for some more atmosphere. Next, look at other things
around you. X NECKLACE (look familiar?), X COIN, X LEVER, X PANEL. You
can GET the COIN and NECKLACE. You can PULL and PUSH the LEVER, but I
don't think it does anything useful. Notice that the panel is loosely
attached--PULL PANEL, then LOOK to see what you've uncovered. GET KEY.

That's all here, so EAST, DOWN, and EAST to get back to the tracks. The
strange figure you saw earlier has left a lamp. X LAMP and GET IT. Go on
to the SOUTH. You can X WALLS and X LICHEN for some more atmosphere, and
you can even X WATER and DRINK WATER. Then go SOUTH again.

See the writing on the door? READ WRITING. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY and
go WEST into...

THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY
-----------------------

Go NORTH so you can interact with things.

X CLOCK, X POSTERS, READ SIGN. Notice that the train comes at 10:30 and
the clock thinks it's 10:24 right now. Then go NORTH into the waiting
room.

The ghost will call your name, but you can ignore it for a moment. X
BOOKS, READ BOOKS, READ NEWSPAPER, X SOFA, SIT ON SOFA will all give you
more atmospheric messages. Then you can deal with the ghost. X WINDOW
and wait a turn, then the ghost asks "Fares Please". Then X GHOST. He
wants you to buy a ticket, so GIVE COIN TO GHOST.

Okay, notice the clock is ticking again--at 10:30 the train will be out
at the track. But spare a second to X TICKET to see where you're
going... a cemetery... brrr. Then go SOUTH and wait until the train
arrives. Once it does, go SOUTH again to enter it.

ON THE SECOND TRAIN
-------------------

Pay attention to the colors of the carriages here, and write them down
in order. It will come in handy later.

In room #1 (the westernmost room) is a red door which is locked. In room
#6 is a locked door.

Also in that room is a Ouija board. If you hang around a moment, the
spirits will spell out "HELP US" on the board. X BOARD--you can ask it
about things just as though it were a real person. Sometime about now,
you may get strange messages about mice running through the room, or you
may hear footsteps on the roof of the train. That's okay. It's just
random atmospheric stuff.

Go ahead and ASK BOARD ABOUT whatever you can think of, including: ME,
TRAIN, GHOST, TICKET. But to continue, you must ASK BOARD ABOUT INGRID,
and the door to your east will open. Go EAST and be confronted by a dead
man rotting. Make sure you read his description carefully, especially
the mention of his badge. You can't actually interact with him yet,
though. Notice the key--X BLACK KEY and GET IT. *Now* you've woken up
the dead guy. GIVE TICKET TO GHOST and he'll leave you alone.

Return to room #1 (go WEST six times) and UNLOCK DOOR WITH BLACK KEY.
Then go WEST twice to enter the train's cab. You'll see a bunch of
controls, which you may want to fiddle with yourself before continuing
with this walkthrough.

Your goal is to get the train to stop. The brake wheel looks
promising--TURN BRAKE WHEEL. That slowed it, but didn't stop it. PULL
LEVER to finish the job. Then DOWN to get out of the train.

CEMETERY AND CHAPEL
-------------------

Go NORTH to the cemetery proper. X STONES and it mentions a particular
inscription. READ INSCRIPTION--you don't want it to be true, but it is.
Ingrid's gone. Unless... NORTHWEST takes you to a fairy dance. X
DANCERS, and then go NORTH to the chapel.

X CHAPEL and NORTH takes you inside. X INSCRIPTION. X BIBLE and try to
GET IT. You can X PEWS and X LECTERN too, if you want. Then go EAST to
the bell room. An empty room, except for that rope. You can PULL ROPE to
ring the bell, but it doesn't do much for you. X ROPE hints at the
proper thing to do... You want to CLIMB ROPE.

(I like to PULL ROPE again when I'm at the top of it, right next to the
bell. But then, I read Dorothy Sayers' _Nine Tailors_.)

The language here is a little weird. GET PARCHMENT and then X PARCHMENT.
X BOOKS tells you to search for things by name... You saw the name of
the church is St. Gorgon (although it was spelled differently), so
SEARCH GORGON and GET EXORCISM. READ EXORCISM for some colorful
language, but nothing else of use. CLIMB ROPE to get back down ("down"
doesn't work, for some reason). WEST and SOUTH to leave the chapel.

Now, you want to go around back. So NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST. X GARGOYLE
and READ INSCRIPTION. Aha, a clue. Go back to the dancers by going
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, then SOUTH. Then ASK DANCERS ABOUT GARGOYLE. The
dancer will kiss you, so I like to KISS DANCERS in return. Then go back
to the chapel and do what the dancers said--three times around,
counterclockwise. You'll end up in back of the chapel having a chat with
Satan.

He asks who dares to call him back; TELL SATAN ABOUT ME. You've only got
one thing on your mind, so ASK SATAN ABOUT INGRID. Uh-oh, is there any
way to save her? ASK SATAN ABOUT HELL. (If this is clued, I don't know
where.) Obviously you have to answer "YES". Satan gives you an hour (60
turns) to do what must be done.

You end up at a funeral service, before an open grave. There's no reason
to know this, but you have to ENTER OPEN GRAVE. DOWN takes you to a pair
of eyes, asking about you. TELL EYES ABOUT ME and then go WEST. X HOUND
to get his name. Pluto (and you can try to go down if you want, but
he'll stop you). Go back EAST and ASK EYES ABOUT PLUTO. Now it's safe to
go WEST and DOWN. DOWN again, and EAST to... yet another train.

THE THIRD TRAIN
---------------

X SWITCH to see which way the train is headed now (northeast), then UP
to enter the train.

OPEN BOX to get a message from Ingrid telling you your goal, then go
NORTH to this train's cab.

The controls are mostly the same as the other train, except that you
must turn the switch to face northwest first, using the colored levers.
Here's where the colors of the second train come in handy... Pull the
colored levers in the order that the carriages were colored in that
train (type PULL RED, PULL BLUE, etc.). I don't actually think it
changes with each game--I think it's always RRBBGR (R = red, B = blue, G
= green).

Now you just have to get the train moving. Remember how the other one
was stopped? Well, do those things in reverse. PUSH REGULATOR LEVER and
TURN BRAKE WHEEL.

If you read the plaque, it will give you a hint how you can escape the
demon: TURN DAMPER, twice.

Congratulations, you win!
Solution to "Groove Billygoat" by Efrain Finnell

This is the "quick and dirty" walkthrough that skips a lot of detail.
There is some randomness you may need to account for.
It is suggested you use the in-game hints (type HINT) before resorting
to the walkthrough.

First:
GO IN
GO OUT
WAIT (for about 15 turns or fiddle with your inventory)

The Orphans will escape and Betsy will start singing you a song. Wait
till she's done or drop her to end it early.

Soon after that, the Thin Man will appear in the Bad Part of Town. Wait
for him to go in to the Badder Part of Town and follow him (GO IN).

The StepEasy will now be apparent. Say the password SHAMONE and you'll
get inside.

(This is determined by asking one of the orphans about JAMON which is
what you thought the Thin Man said.)

TAKE OFF COAT
GIVE COAT TO GIRL (You'll get a coatcheck marker.)
NORTHWEST
WEST
MOONWALK NORTH
PUT MARKER IN BEAM
TAKE DIFFERENT MARKER
NORTH
EAST
SOUTHEAST
GIVE MARKER TO GIRL (You'll get the Thin Man's left glove.)

To get to the northeast quadrant where the stairs up are, you must
dance. You need to start in the southwest corner of the warehouse by the
jukebox. You have to start at the beginning of the song. You can either
wait for the Thin Man to throw a coin in the jukebox, put the coin you
found in the trash can in the jukebox if you didn't give it to the bum,
or HIT JUKEBOX Fonzie-style to start the music. Each move must be typed
in order before it happens in the description Don't type in moves the
text says you do automatically as it speeds up toward the end.

PIROUETTE
KNEES IN
NOD NOD
HEELPIVOT
POINT POINT
HEADPOP

NORTHEAST

Now you can go UP to the rooftop (click click click!)
WEST
WEST
USE CPR ON ANNIE

Thugs will kidnap the orphans and attack the apartment.
You must defeat them randomly by using the Thin Man's dragon shouts.
WEAR GLOVE then

AAOW - will knock the thugs back and has a chance of disarming them, but
will not stop bullets or ninja stars.
HOO - will stop bullets, thrown ninja stars, and lunging thugs who
attack you physically when out of weapons.
EEHEE - will get rid of whatever is hanging in the air. 

Once you stop all four thugs:

1/ General hints

Before revealing the complete solution, I thought it may be helpful to
have some tips for those who are stuck and just want a gentle nudge in
the right direction.

The aim of the game is to collect 5 specific items and leave them in the
pub (hence the name, 'Five Artifacts Inn').
The five artifacts are well-known items from 'The Hitch Hikers Guide to
the Galaxy', so you can discount the items you find that are unique to
the game (such as the Alterian coin).
To check if an item is one of the 5 artifacts, drop it in the Inn and
type SCORE.  You get 20 points for each object, so your score level will
tell you whether you have got a correct item.
Some of the artifacts are useless, except for scoring purposes, but
others are needed to solve puzzles in the game.
To get the Vogon ship to fly, read the book of poetry in the Vogon
Navigation room (where the poetry is graffitti'd on the wall).
To get the 'Heart of Gold' to fly, drop the rusty old engine in the
control room and push the lever (As the sign says: Don't pull the
lever).
Get the babel fish before giving the Arkleseizure a drink.
Use the coin to buy the chocolate first - don't use it on the Nutrimat
until you have the chocolate.

appear.  Don't let your input get ahead of the events onscreen, or you
may find yourself blasted into space.  Secondly, the gun can overheat
after a certain number of turns, so it is important to switch it off

3/ Cosmic Capers

While browsing through the screenshots in James Burrow's excellent
'gamebase 64', I came across an adventure game called 'Cosmic Capers',
which can be found on the 'Blast from the Past' disks (Blast 97, menu
option 9).  As soon as I saw the first line ("Hi there, guys, I'm Bugsy,
your lovable computer companion."), I knew it was the same game -
especially since 'Bob Chappell' and 'Supersoft' appear in reverse video
on the screen.

If you play this game, you will see that it is exactly the same game as
HH-64.  The only differences are that the reference to Douglas Adams and
Pan Books has been removed, and all the objects and places have been
superficially renamed.  However, it is obvious by the names that the
Hitch Hikers Guide version came first:  all the Cosmic Capers names keep
the same kind of format (for want of a better term): the 'bowl of
petunias' becomes a 'vase of pansies', the 'Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of
Traal' becomes the 'Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo', and so on.  And it
is unlikely that Cosmic Capers was first with the idea of bad alien
poetry!

So, if you want to solve 'Cosmic Capers', just follow the walkthrough
and use the appropriate nouns (eg, 'SHOOT VERRUCAN rather than SHOOT
VOGON).

- - - - - - 
4/ Miscellaneous

I was stuck on this game for a very long time (somewhere between 13 - 14
years, in fact, but this included several years without a C64).  I
finally found the solution on a disk of adventure game solutions created
using the Vizawrite 64 word processor.  I loaded up "The Hitch Hikers"
file to test the disk, expecting it to be the solution for the Infocom
game, and was bowled over when it turned out to be a walkthrough for the
Supersoft title!  Being in an 80 column format (on a 40 column screen),
I had to take two screen dumps and then stick them together in order to
print the solution out.  When I got home, however, I found that the
walkthrough missed a number of steps - a fairly common problem when
people write solutions down as they play the game.  Having used the
solution to get past my sticking point, I managed to finish the game
with a bit of judicious mapping.  I must say that after having waited so
many years, the ending was quite a disappointment!

There is a Spectrum version of this game (HH-64), which states it is (c)
Estuary Software Products.  It does not say who the programmer was, or
what year it was made.  There is also no reference to whether ESP and
Supersoft are the same software house, or one version was licensed from
the other.  I have always wondered whether HH-64 was  truly a piece of
commercial software, or if the 'by kind permission' line was just a bit
of fun added to a 'tribute' game by some keen fan.  However, it is
strange to find a non-commercial game popping up on two separate
platforms (unless one was just a home-attempt on one platform at
reproducing the commercial version from another platform?).

A post was made on internet news in Nov-Dec 98 by a person who claimed
to have programmed an intro to the game.  They were looking for a copy
of the file as they couldn't find it anywhere on the internet.  Having
searched both comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm, I have not been able
to find a copy of this post either to reproduce it here or obtain the
posters e-mail address in order to get more information from them.
Possibly the question was posted on rec.arts.int-fiction.

Obviously HH-64 had to have been released before Infocom got the rights
to create a HHG game.  According to the 'Infocom Fact Sheet VIII:
Chronology' by Paul David Doherty, the Infocom HHG was released in
October 1984.  I have a note that I bought my copy of this game in
August 1985 (compiled 21st December 1984, if you're interested).  My
preliminary map for HH-64 appears before this entry in my map book, and
it is dated '1st May'.  Whether that is 1984 or 1985 I cannot tell.

No information on HH-64 can be found on the Adventure Games List
maintained by Hans Persson and kept on ftp.gmd.de at
if-archive/info/adventure-game-history.

General tips:

Best weapons:
cleaver (village, in store) strength 10
battleaxe (eastern forest, grass roof hut) strength 18
fire whip (mystic cave, held by golem) strength 22

Most wearables has no effect, but the armor and shield (village, paladin)
occasionally heal you, and the cloak (elf) occasionally increases your damage.

There are two NPCs who can help you in combat
Werewolf (in mansion)
Tursk (in caverns)

Eating the rations (village, tavern) will give you an extra 200 hp and refill
your food count.  Eating the food (village, small room) will give you
100 hp and refill your food count, and will reappear in the small room
afterwards.

Lecture Feature
An Interactive Fiction by Paul Equinox Collins

Note: A few puzzles require speaking with someone who will probably be moving
around. So if you need to "talk to" someone mobile, you may have to walk
around for a bit to find them, or if you're trying to do something sneaky you
may have to wait for them to leave the room before doing it. In these
situations, the next line will be a room to go to to reorient yourself on the
walkthrough.

There's a list of all the students you need to recruit at line 225.

Reflective Comments
--------------------
I quite liked this game and even though only the beginning currently exists, 
most of it is complete enough to be considered a short game.  I thought the
answering machine puzzle was a bit tricky because there was no description of a 
button on it and it must be assumed that it can be turned on and off somehow. 
The game would have benefited greatly if it was more polished. I really liked

Mindshadow (Activision) Solution.

   Part 1

 Let's get started. You awake on a deserted beach with a spectacular
view of the ocean. In fact, look at the ocean but but don't go in the
water. Go N, then enter the hut and take some straw. Examine the trash
can and take the candle. Well, you don't really need it. Exit the hut
then go E.
 Take a piece of steel from the dory, then go E again and take a vine.
Go W, W, S, and drop all but the vine. Go E, and you should be at the
edge of a cliff. Tie the vine to a rock then go Down. Enter the cave and
examine and search all, then take a rock from the ground. Dig in ground.
Take the map, then E, Up, W. Look at the map, then N.
 At this point, you might want to save the game. Go N, N, E, N, E, E, S,
S, E. Search the trunk and take the bottle, but don't drink it. Go W, W,
N, W, W, S, W, S, S, S. Drop the map, then take the piece of steel and
the shell. Listen to the shell. Type, "BANG ROCK WITH STEEL OVER STRAW
TO MAKE FIRE". Drop the rock and the piece of steel, then wait. When the
boat comes, offer the captain the bottle.

 MINDSHADOW
   Part 2

 You should now be on the pirate ship and the captain will have left you
alone to go exploring. Go N, W, and talk to the doctor. Go S, then fight
with the man. Go S again and take the meat cleaver. You can also eat the
fish if you like sashimi. Go N, N, E, S, S, S, W, then cut the chain
with the meat cleaver. Go E, N, N, E, E.

 You should now be in England. Go E, E, E, S, and search the sleeping
man. Take the hat and the money, then go N, W, W, S.  Give the man 5
pounds and take the pole. Go N, W, and get the debris with the pole.
Drop the pole, then take the newspaper.  Read it. Remember to remember.
Go E, N, and talk to the man. Give the man 5 pounds and remember the
password (it may vary with different disks). Go S, E, N, E. This is
another good spot to save the game.
 Talk to the woman, then give her the hat. Go E. Examine the drink, then
follow the man. Go S, W, then take the hat and look inside the hat.
Rather then leave a tip, you can kiss the woman. Go W, N, E, then type,
"CHANDRALT" or whatever the password is in your game. Give the man 200
pounds for your ticket then go W, S, S, W, N, N, and enter the airplane.
Remember to remember.
 You should now be in beautiful downtown Luxembourg. Go N, W, then BOOTH
11. Talk to the man. If that doesn't work, search the man. Take the note
and the ID card, then read both of them. Go E, E, N, N, W, Up, N. This
is another spot to save the game.

 MINDSHADOW
   Part 3

 Go W, then DUCK. Examine the room and take all. Read the parchment. Go
E, S, Down, E, S, and now we are going on a little nature hike. Go E, E,
E, S, and dig in the ground with the shell. Drop the shell, then take
the leaflet and read it. It sure does look like a bank account number.
 Go N, W, W, W, W, and talk to the woman. Type in the bank number then
open the box. Take the gun, then drop the box. Go E, N, W, Up, N, N, N,
N.
 This is it. Save the game again, then E. Shoot the man with the gun,
then take themessage and read it. Now, if you have remembered all the
names and found all the clues, you should regain your memory and solve
the game by using the THINK COMMAND.

 Type "THINK ARCMAN". "THINK BOB". "THINK MASTERS". "THINK JARED".
"THINK TYCOON". "THINK LUXEMBOURG". "THINK WILLIAM". At this point, a
new screen should appear with the entire story of your trials and
tribulations.
Moon-Shaped
A Fairy Tale Retold by Jason Ermer

Annotated Walkthrough for Release 2


This document gives the full list of commands needed to complete Release
2 of Moon-Shaped. The walkthrough was written so that users can see "the
full story", but it is efficient in its approach and so won't lead to
the most rewarding gaming experience.

In addition, different adventurers will find different pathways through
the game; this document describes only one possible path. Annotations
have therefore been provided to make it clear what's happening so that
those who have progressed to a certain point via a different path can
get their bearings.

Comments on this document (as well as on the game itself) are welcome:
jasonermer -at- gmail -dot- com.


We play Rosalind Wechsler, age 13. It's Rosalind's birthday, but her
mother is distraught and either hasn't remembered or isn't paying
attention to her. So, Rosalind decides to visit her grandmother who
lives in the forest. To prepare for the journey, we'll need all of
grandmother's supplies (everything that's on the table: the wine, the
bread, and the jar of honey), plus our red cape:

> take everything from the table
> open the chest
> take the cape
> wear the cape

Before we go, though, some insight to the story can be gained from
trying to talk to Rosalind's mother:

> north

Then, it's out the door and on to grandmother's house:

> out
> south
> southwest

Upon entering the woods, we meet a wolf (press any key to advance
through the cut scene). He leads us somewhat astray, but Rosalind is
becoming a resourceful young woman, and we soon finds our way back to
the path:

> (any compass direction)
> (any compass direction)
> (any compass direction)

This puts us at the covered bridge and the edge of the Black Forest. Now
that we've reached the forest, many options are possible. For the
pursposes of this walkthrough, we'll go first to grandmother's house (to
retreive her locket). It isn't far:

> north
> northwest
> north
> north

Something seems amiss here in grandmother's living room, and having a
good look around may be in order. We're after the locket, which is up in
the attic crawlspace, which we can access via the kitchen:

> west

Before going up the the attic, note the cellar door:

> open the cellar door

(More on that later.) In the meantime, let's proceed to the attic:

> up
> examine the glint
> take the locket
> wear the locket

Now that we have grandmother's locket, other important parts of the game
will become available. There's one challenge though:

> open the locket

The locket won't cooperate with this, at least not yet. A hint about
this can be found by stepping out into the woods and trying again:

> down
> east
> south
> open the locket

To open the locket, we need to get out from under the canopy of the
forest (and into the center of the lake):

> south
> east
> east

To properly get out from under the canopy, we'll need to get into the
center of the lake, by boat:

> pull the chain
> enter the boat

Under the unfiltered moonlight, we can:

> open the locket

This action activates the magical powers of the locket, prompting a
variety of visions and remembrances throughout the rest of the game. To
get back in to shore, we:

> pull the chain

There were some parts of grandmother's house left unexplored, so let's
return there (to collect the walking stick and the monocle, among other
things). On the way we'll make a detour so that we can have some light
in the basement. To make all this possible, we'll need to re-purpose the
jar of honey.

> open the jar
> wash the jar

Then, we'll make ourselves a lantern:

> west
> catch some fireflies

Now back to grandmother's house for some snooping around her side yard.

> west
> north (*this action will trigger a vision)
> west

In the side yard, there's grandmother's woodpile and the hatchet she
uses to trim her firewood.

> take the hatchet
> examine the woodpile

Someone's been digging through the woodpile. Perhaps you should as well:

> search the woodpile

You find an unusual log, which bears a closer look:

> examine the log (* this action will trigger a vision)

The other major attraction in the side yard is the old well:

> examine the well
> examine the bucket

Recall that the cellar door was locked. This is out alternative route
underground, where we find some important items, and return to the
kitchen:

> enter the bucket
> take the key
> north
> take the glass fragment
> examine it (*)
> east
> east [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNLOCKING]

Now let's return to the living room (to collect the gloves and the
pebbles):

> east
> examine the quilt
> take it
> look

Disturbing the quilt uncovers the gloves, which will come in handy later
(the quilt itself is unnecessary).

> drop the quilt
> take the gloves
> examine them

The other important item here is the grandfather clock:

> examine the clock
> open it

To open the clock, recall a specific detail from the vision:

> concentrate on the locket (*)
> set the time to 2:35

Inside the clock, we find a boy's hunting jacket. The jacket itself is
less important than the contents of its pockets:

> search jacket
> examine the pebbles
> south
> examine the pebbles (*)

Moon-Shaped is clearly based on the Grimm Brothers' tale of Little Red
Riding Hood... but it may be at this point that another tale begins to
come to mind (if it hasn't already). Anyhow, those pebbles sure are
shiny -- just watch:

> out

Now that we've begun to notice them, we can spot those shiny pebbles in
places we hadn't noticed before! They form a path which we can follow
(to visit the burned ground and collect the candies):

> southeast (*)
> east
> northeast
> northwest
> northeast (*)

This creepy patch of burned ground has past significance (which is
revealed explicitly if the old woman's monocle has already been
discovered):

> look
> concentrate on the monocle (*)

When the old woman wore the monocle, she moved as though was was
avoiding "invisible obstacles". Wearing the monocle will grant us a
similar ability:

> wear the monocle

Uh-oh. The orange candies inside the cage are mesmerizing. If we try a
couple of different things while we're transfixed, a few hints will be
revealed about how to free us from the candy's spell:

> blink
> eat the bread

Now, let's try that again:

> wear monocle
> examine the cage
> take the candies

We can't reach the candies, at least not with our arms:

> push the candies with the walking stick
> take candies
> examine them (*)

The pieces are coming together, but there's one area that we haven't
explored completely yet. We'll go there to collect the dagger, crush the
candies, and learn the details of the curse (which will kick off the
endgame):

> remove the monocle
> southwest
> west
> north (*)

The cave entrance is blocked:

> north

But the vision we saw upon arriving indicates that the walking stick
will be helpful:

> swing the walking stick
> north
> down

There are several things of note in the cavern. First the inscriptions,
which are un-readable without the aid of the monocle:

> examine the inscriptions
> wear the monocle
> examine the inscriptions
> remove the monocle

Once we have taken the candies and read the inscriptions, things can
progress rapidly towards the endgame. A few final visions will "barge
in" during the next few rounds. The first of these visions gives a hint
about where to go next (the waterfall).

But first: note that the inscriptions mention a bit about "sweet
temptation" and show an image of snow or powder sprinking down onto a
skull. To make some sweet powder, we'll use the mortar and pestle here:

> take the pestle
> put the candies into the mortar
> crush them with the pestle
> take the powder
> put the pestle into the mortar

Also note the tin box:

> open the box
> take the dagger

Ouch! The silver allergy was also mentioned in the inscriptions, but
don't worry. We're prepared:

> wear the gloves

Although you might have to do some inventory management, depending on
what's in your hands at the time (the walking stick, for example, is
dirty and would ruin grandmother's gloves). Once you're wearing the
gloves, you can:

> take the dagger

Then, it's off the the waterfall (and the endgame):

> up
> south
> south
> southwest
> southwest
> down (*)

If you had visited the bottom of the waterfall before, it was a dead
end. However, by this point you're more attuned to your surroundings.
Note: from here, there will be no turning back -- this would be a good
time to save the game!

> north

There are two graves in this clearing (one for Rosalind's uncle Hansel
and one for her brother Rainer), along with the wolf (her father) with
grandmother (who was swallowed whole) in his belly. According the the
inscriptions, we're in search of the bones of the first cursed person in
the family to die. That's uncle Hansel, and to access his bones:

> open the wooden grave


From here, there are eight final outcomes possible. The endings have
varying levels of "success" depending on whether you and your family
members survive the next few rounds and whether you're able to lift the
curse. There are several actions that can be undertaken in a variety of
combinations:

-- Attacking the wolf with the hatchet will free grandmother from the
wolf's belly without killing him.

-- Attacking the wolf with the silver dagger will kill him (and
grandmother, too, if she's still trapped in his belly).

-- Sprinkling the powder onto Uncle Hansel's bones will lift the curse
and turn the wolf back into your father. (This action will kill
grandmother if she's in the wolf's belly at the time.)

-- Going south will be considered an attempt to run away. (You'll be
given two opportunities to reconsider because this choice will always
end badly.)

Here are the eight combinations that will end the game:

--- Ending #1 ---
This is the best possible ending, in which Rosalind, grandmother, and
father all survive and are free from the curse.

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #2 ---
Rosalind and grandmother survive and are free from the curse, but the
wolf (your father) dies:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #3 ---
Rosalind and father survive and are free from the curse, but grandmother
dies:

> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #4 ---
Rosalind survives and is free from the curse, but father and grandmother
both die:

> attack wolf with the silver dagger
> sprinkle the powder onto the bones

--- Ending #5 ---
Rosalind and grandmother survive but remain cursed. The wolf (your
father) dies:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #6 ---
Rosalind survives but remains cursed. Grandmother and the wolf both die:

> attack the wolf with the silver dagger
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #7 ---
Rosalind dies. Grandmother survives, but remains cursed:

> attack the wolf with the hatchet
> south
> south
> south

--- Ending #8 ---
Rosalind and grandmother both die. The wolf survives but remains cursed:

> south
> south
> south

(At least skim through the StreamDiver Manual, and read the mission description and the mission report.)

(Now, one last thing. If you're using the advanced interface, I suggest typing SCAN. Now the left-hand window pane will list all scannable items every time you walk into a room. You'll see the necessity of scanning later, and it's incredibly useful to have a list of scannable items for each room you enter.)

(Also, another note. I didn't have the translate chip on during most of my playthrough, but as far as I know there is no disadvantage to always having that chip on. So type TRANSLATE now if you want.)

This is no tragedy, as you can always talk to Joxley and arrange to come back here, but it's worth keeping in mind. Also note that using your shield or cloak chips will use up your temporal capacitor charge a lot faster.)

               Sing1  Sing2  Sing3

    Amplitude  49     195    212
    Frequency  60-80  70-90  off the charts
    Phase      [*]    [*]    74
    [*] 180 degrees out of phase with each other.

(Your time-traveling nemesis stabilized Singularity 1 and took it with him. And since he didn't change the dials afterward, the dials represent the correct values for stabilizing Singularity 1. That is, amplitude=44, freqency=77, phase=223.)

(Putting all this information together, I predicted that Singularity 2 would have an amplitude of 190 to 195, a frequency of 70 to 90, and a phase of 43. This range does indeed hold the correct value.)

(My first guess was amp=190, freq=87, phase=43. This was not correct. And unfortunately, when you are close but not quite right, the game gives you no hint of this. As far as I know, all you can do is use a lot of trial and error, or get the help of somebody who's solved the game before.)

(If the power conditioner's initial setting of 55 is 10% over normal, then normal must be 50. And if the damage threshold is at least 50% over normal, then the damage threshold must be at least 75.)

(This is a nuclear weapon stolen from the submarine SSN Lansing. It has been set to do a secondary explosion if moved.)

(We need to deactivate this setting.)

(If you look in your documents, you'll see the thermonuclear activation reference. This is the info from the "stiff leather folder" in the submarine control suite. It says that you can interact with this weapon by typing an 8-digit code consisting of a 5-digit security code, a 1-digit weapon ID number, and a 2-digit function code.)

(That same reference, as you can see, also gives a very extensive listing of function codes.)

(You'll also need to look at the "launch codes" document (from that small leather folder from that dead guy's briefcase in the submarine). It says there are two launch codes, depending on which type of weapon.)

(Furthermore, you're going to need to guess the weapon ID number. When you interfaced with the submarine computer, did you note any information that might assist in making this guess?)

(Finally, it is helpful, though not essential, to have noted some information you get when you examine the missiles in the submarine.)

(The missile is #6.)

(Therefore, according to what it says when you examine the missiles, it is Weapon Class B.)

(Therefore, based on the launch codes, you should use the code 17015.)

(Finally, the proper function code to deactivate the security setting is 19.)

(And we now have a nuclear weapon, which, unlike the missiles just south of here, is small enough to be brought inside the sphere.)

(Furthermore, the conceit is that if you set off a nuclear weapon within the sphere, the temporal shield will prevent damage to everything outside of it, even as it itself is destroyed.)

(So our job here is to detonate the nuclear weapon. Forget everything you learned playing Trinity; violence is the answer to this one.)

Walkthrough for Necrotic Drift

So, we're in New Haz again, on a different outing. How different? It's a
bit like comparing The World's End to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in
the Blood and Ice-cream Trilogy: Necrotic Drift's setting and focus are
more linear and narrow than Fallacy of Dawn, but with a darker, more
mature plot and characters. I may make another reference to these films
later, but I'll keep it to one.

Chapter One: Duffy
Our intro is to a nice guy named Duffy, his love of D&D and one of the
few times he and his dad were best friends as well as family. Today
however, he's rolling his Dodge stat against video rental fees by going
to Academy Videos in New Haz so he can have a movie night with his
on/off girlfriend Audrey. Trying to prove a point about The Lord of the
Rings can lead to danger, it seems.
You don't 'need' to talk to Gibs or your room-mates in this number-based
dialogue system, but there's a nice bit of flavor.
Gibs is your best mate and chatting to him goes a little bit more into
your problems with Audrey (any number), and why your room-mates should
not be around if you want a movie night with her (if you picked 3).
Talking to him again after he mentions his plans for tonight offers some
foreshadowing.
Talking to both of your room-mates gives you an idea of why they
probably shouldn't be your room-mates.
X Clerk if you like- Adrian Bates hasn't changed a bit, not even his
profile photo. 
X DVDs. You can also X the genres to get an idea of Duffy's personal
taste.
Take DVD- no need to specify as Duffy automatically takes The Lord of
the Rings. 
You can also TAKE NAIL GUN when the clerk tells all of you to hurry up
for sleazy reasons, as he places it on the counter. He doesn't notice
you nicking it, so it looks like he really wants that massage...
Soon enough it begins. Some creature lurks its way into the store. The
clerk thinks it's a tramp and shows his caring attitude from the last
game. Everyone else thinks it's a bot, but bots other than Failed Romero
normally don't attack people- not even rude video store staff.
I normally ATTACK THING and save the clerk, but as long as you deal with
it before it starts on you. In fact, if you let it knock the clerk out,
Gibs encourages you to go get the nail-gun- which you may not have
noticed before because you weren't reading closely enough (oops).
So, no need to pay to hire LOtR. Let's go home. E.

You can X your car all you want, you can't realise that the bot's
climbed into your car until you try to 'enter car'. Cheeky bastard knows
to hide on the car floor.
Attack thing again until it drops.
Enter car.
Drive.

Chapter Two: Audrey
Onto your date with Audrey! In your living room, with two troublesome
housemates...This is definitely the part that reminded me a little of
Shaun of the Dead, so this is a problem that many people are having
today, especially since many people can't move out. This chapter is
fairly dialogue-driven, and your choices matter more in the banter you
read next. You can skip to the next chapter in this walkthrough if you
like.
The Duffster shares the story of his one big win that lead to his car, a
less limited wardrobe and his relationship: a D&D tournament that was
won through being a skilled and kind player...five years ago.
 
T Pang. Unfortunately, no matter which number you pick he won't bugger
off. When you hear the knock on the door, OPEN DOOR to let Audrey in.
You can talk to your housemates as they argue over what DVD they're
watching, but you can't change how they behave.
You can give your housemates a serve for ruining your date and being
rude to your girlfriend. T Pang, T Criswell in that order if you want to
do both.
N to go to your room and face the music. 
T Audrey.
Rather than her talk being a generic bitch about your housemates and a
nasty screech blaming you for it, Audrey is concerned about you. She
believes you deserve and can make a happier life for yourself, and that
you two are falling into a rut instead of enjoying life. Looks like
she's grown from once dumping Duffy for someone trying to buy his
funeral plot early- then dumping him for failing. You don't have to
agree, but repeat T Audrey and choose numbers to keep the conversation
going. 
She's also moving to Texas and wants you there with her, but you're not
keen on it. When you tell her this, she's a bit miffed and begins trying
to convince you.
Your only option is to say you have work. Not exactly a lie, but you'll
be starting early. Audrey agrees to talk more about Texas later and you
leave on uneasy-but-happy terms. 
S to get ready to leave.
You have nothing to say to anyone now. Let's go to work. OUT.

Chapter 3: Corporate Fret
Talk to Trott, read the postcard to learn a little about Delarion Yar's
happy ending.
Talk to Gibbs when he arrives, and do the same for Audrey when she shows
up.
Audrey wants to talk to you, but the request is more mundane: can you
help her friends working at the Bead Store with their register computer?
Try talking to the girls as they set up their ill-advised ritual. X
register. A cable appears to be causing the problem for the PC. Ooh, a
pretty crystal ball holder. Take Holder.
Take cable. 
To get back to it more quickly, STAND UP. Everyone is fine, Casey even
seems a bit too happy that the lights have blown. Sydney may need help.
X her...
And that's not Sydney. The Not-Sydney has weird demon eyes, is floating
and has now summoned a...

Skeleton: Duffy knows that skeletons, if they are like role-playing
skeletons, are vulnerable to blunt force. Where's a good bludgeon...the
crystal ball holder. Attack with holder!
Unfortunately, Duffy's afterthoughts inspire the Not-Sydney demon to
play with the funny little monsters and rules of D&D. At least they're
well-known, right?

Chapter Four: Necrotic Progression
After the crickets stop, Gibbs pulls everyone out of the store with
plans to escape the mall, which is now in lock-down. You, as Duffy, have
now been entrusted with being the group tank.

The only other person we care about in the mall is Trott (and even if we
don't care, he knows how to open the doors) so let's go find him. You
might as well drop that holder, as it's broken.

With Trott being as smart as he is, he would have gone to security to
find a way to lock out monsters or find weapons. We have to make sure
he's okay either way. Go east twice and then south to get back to your
store. Pick up the stool if you want to use another blunt object. E to
back office, x handprint on the window. X shelves, then LOOK IN
cardboard box to get the Sierra Hobbies Gamer Glove. N to move on from
dumping ground to lounge. Open the door to get into the security room
antechamber. 
Trott must not have heard us. The doors may be kept shut for a reason.
Maybe we haven't checked everything yet...Damn.

Zombie: Gibs makes a good start on attacking the zombie but his lacrosse
stick is knocked away and you have to save him lest you get two zombies
on your neck. TAKE STICK and do not let it go. You will need this more
often. 
Attack zombie with stick!
Talk to Gibs to see if he is okay and to cheer him up with the story of
losing your virginity...on 9/11.
Trott is actually quite well and will not turn into a zombie soon, one
of the few benefits of being a chubby nerd. He will open doors if you
ask him nicely. He offers to open the Sports Store door now, but I
prefer the 'later' option as the girls are just outside and have no
weapons. When he gives you the switched-on phone, just talk to Trott
when you're back at the sporting goods store.

However, there may be a few potential improvised weapons in the sport
shop, even if it's just a door knob in a sock. I like taking this moment
to talk to Casey, especially about boyfriends, caps and Audrey being
happiest with you. However, get in that store when the screams start!

Ghoul: X ghoul. Gibs is brave enough to draw attention away from Audrey,
but becomes paralysed due to direct contact with it. If you haven't
already, get those socks from outside the shop. Wear socks (as mittens
so they protect your hands). Attack!

Audrey takes you to see if an exit can be found, leaving Casey to look
after Gibs. What she finds instead is a suspected wraith at the perfume
counter and pulls you into the jewelry store to hide.

This part was a bit tricky.
Talk to Audrey as the vision unfolds. Empty pleather purse, and take the
silver comb that drops. Wraiths don't like silver.
When you first notice Audrey's shadow acting strangely, attack shadow
with comb. Shadows also hate silver and we don't want it hurting Audrey.
It will crumble and Duffy will entertain the risky idea of getting the
wraith inside to lower the temperature so the safe will open and get rid
of the wraith.
Yell to bring the wraith over. Now it's a waiting game. Watch
As soon as that sleazy bastard makes the safe lock open, open safe, take
silver rings and then throw those rings at the wraith. It will now turn
to dust and it is safe to leave.

The make-up kiosk is broken, but there is a bottle of perfume to be
salvaged. Not a gift for Audrey though. Throw that bottle of perfume
over the railing to get rid of that horrible smell. 
IN to enter elevator. Press 'Down'. Press 'Open Doors'. 
West.
Ghast: This guy hates cleanliness more than a sharehouse slacker. Take
water from the fountain. Throw water from the fountain at it. Even you
feel sorry for the hopeless sap.

For fun, go north, the display case at the Sunglass Hut and grab those
shades.
Lips in Poster Store: Be polite, there's no need to tempt fate. Listen
carefully to directions out and turn the flip rack to see the posters,
some even relevant to your quest. Remember the candles, text and water.
Spectre: Be nice. We'll need him later. Never tempt the non-immediately
hostile creatures.

You can't help the poor dead girl crucified in the cheap paperback
bookstore, but the text by her will be helpful. Take text. If you read
pink text with messed-up capitalization and accusations of being screwed
up, you are taking the right things to banish Not-Sydney.

Revenant in Candle Shop: Be nice. Tell him his murderer was the
Not-Sydney if you like. Talk to Audrey during the vision. Take menorah.
Take the urn from the crappy party favors store. Go back to the
fountain. Take water. Put water into urn.

Get back to the west side where Gibs and Casey were digging up rubble
for the way out until a vampire lady stole her. We can still save Casey
but we need protection in the form of garlic and to handle that
poltergeist throwing stuff at us.
Poltergeist: Drop all items at health store. W. Take all. E. Drop all.
Repeat this until there is nothing there to play with. 

At the Health store, search shelf. Take ointment. You will most likely
need this shortly. Move down, move further into the coffin room, then
into the alcove and take the garlic from the trestle. Immediately, you
have triggered the mummy, possibly Guardian of the Garlic? 
Mummy: This guy's strong, fast and poisonous for being dead for so long,
so you can't take too many hits and running away will only mean you get
hit in the back. It can be infuriatingly funny if you make a dash back
to the shop during the fight because Gibs will warn that the mummy's
behind you just as the last hit and poison is killing you. 

So...
Back to coffin room. South to go out. (Listen for the bang as the mummy
hits the bracket). North to go in again. Throw stick at bracket. The
torch will fall and burn the mummy to a crisp. Take stick.
If you're touched from the hits: Open jar. Take salve. 'Put salve on me'
to cure mummy ichor.

Search the coffin. You will find a blood bag amongst the dried blood.
Always good to have some of the universal type lying around, so take it.
Get back to near the fountain. The spectre is friendly enough, despite
his chilly exterior. He's happy to hold onto the blood for you and keep
it in good nick.

W.
Vampire: We have our garlic now. Attack with stick to eventually stake
heart. 

Let's go NW to get out of here. Not-Sydney is back now, but we have the
tools to banish the demon.
Follow Audrey's cue to read the text.
As far as drinking the water goes, we need a virgin. Who is a virgin?
Well, not our main characters and Trott's too far away anyway. Ah, the
head of the ghast you felt sorry for as you defeated it! No one would
touch someone that awful.
Pour water into the head.

You need to light a candle to finish the banishing ritual. X menorah.
Note white candle. Trott will appear and give you a lighter.
Light white candle with lighter.
Now the demon is defeated and cowed as you explain that your friends
that allegedly slowed you down are the ones who helped you get there,
and that the tabletop games fundamentally teach you about working
together, using your strengths to assist others' weaknesses and
protecting them so that they can repay you.
Sydney is now safe. Casey is not out of the woods yet, but the main
danger is gone. 
Gibs will be telling you of the time you have left to save Casey. The
vampire curse may be gone, but so is a lot of her blood. 
N.

Because you gave the blood bag to the spectre, he will now appear and
give it back. Audrey, being a good medical student, can now start the
transfusion to save her and you immediately know the video store is a
good isolated, dark place for a makeshift surgery. With the help of your
friends, your grit and a lot of D&D knowledge, you have saved a life and
may have kicked smoking. However...


Epilogue
Story time. Four months later, Benji's turned the arcade into something
more like a junk store. With Dance Dance Revolution knock-offs and
vomiting dolls. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Everyone has pretended the incident never happened. Casey has severed
all contact from you. Audrey moved to Texas anyway, leaving you behind.
This portion is conversation dependent, so talk a bit to Trott. It turns
out we couldn't have used him at the end and he's convinced there are
several mundane explanations for that night.
Attack the reappearing bot before it attacks you. Gibs will become a big
damn hero and find a practical use for a stripper pole. He's finally
ready to talk a bit about that night if you choose (and you finally get
a thank-you and bro-hug) or you can ask about new job opportunities.
Either way, keep talking to Gibs and Duffy will finally get the penny
that dropped for us ages ago, make the hardest phone call of his life
and take Gibs up on a long-standing offer. This will be the first night
for the rest of his life...

For anyone who's really cut up about the ending:
Yes, there's a lot of sadness in it all, but the final moment here is
Duffy's personal turning point. I think it makes sense: while main
characters often have their 'Eureka!' or personal problems solved during
the intense conflict, and Duffy did have his realization to what his
only real hobby was truly about, he was trying to help himself and his
friends survive the night rather than trying for a crowning moment of
awesome. The fact that no one ever wants to talk about it and face up to
nearly dying doesn't help his self-image either. It's only after he
chooses to take a real opportunity to start something better in his life
that he becomes a hero.

also included some hints for future TADS programmers which may or may
not come in handy. I apologize ahead of time for any unhandy hints.

Cody Sandifer (sandifer@crmse.sdsu.edu)



THE SOLUTION:

In general, studies in museums have shown that people are more likely to
turn right than left, so the order of the solutions might be backwards.
No, I am not kidding about the studies.

The "endgame" puzzles are two or three pages down the line.



You can't find your way across the puddle in the laundromat...

I suppose that you already tried to jump the darn thing. It won't work,
but it's fun to try anyway. I included mop as a verb only because a
playtester suggested it -- there isn't a mop anywhere. Perhaps you could
cover the puddle with something? The something would have to be large in
an absorbent kind of way, making the puddle safe to walk upon. It's on
the floor somewhere. In the pub. If you can't find a container, you
should do some serious searching -- especially in the tank area. You can
probably figure out the next step yourself. What kind of machine hangs
out in a laundromat? The date on the receptacle is a clue, albeit a lame
one. Put the dollar coin in the vertical slot. You're in the money!



You can't get the valuable rock in the rock museum...

Citizens of Chewton installed an alarm, but they're rather,
ahhh......stupid. The key isn't difficult to find once you take this
fact into account. I can't use invisiclues, so I'll just type in the
answer backwards: (.elbat eht rednu si yek ehT) Don't bother holding the
clue up to a mirror -- you'll just get confused. The letters are
forwards even though the words are backwards.



You can't get the bikers to leave the bar...

You could act on your violent desires, but that'll just get you
poetically smacked around. They seem to be intent on completing their
ritual -- remember the perfect note? I bet you could find one. If you're
looking for a tape recorder, don't bother. I decided that there was way
too much random noise to allow players to tape everything audible. Plus,
you'd probably get sick of hearing "Why would you want to tape that?" a
million times. Oh yeah -- the note is in a lofty place. Those choruses
really know their stuff. You haven't been to heaven, you say? Take a
good look at the pebbles on the tank. Then throw something at them --
but make sure you haven't stolen the smock first.



You can't get the mechanic to pay any attention to you...

Even with the hints I programmed into the game? Really? Kick 'em twice.
If you don't, your thoughts will nag you 50 turns later.



You can't find anything to give the mechanic...

Take a good look at the objects in the pub. Specifically, the (elbat
loop). Is this backwards thing annoying you? I hate reading clues before
I'm ready, so I figured that this is a fair compromise. If you're
dyslexic, I'm probably destroying whatever letter sense you've developed
through years of hard work. Sorry.



You can't get the money from the juggler's hat...

This one is pretty tough, actually. To get the cash, you'll need to
distract the juggler. If you haven't already thrown something at the
juggler, you should try it out. If you're still stuck, take a good look
at what she's juggling. The balls are round. Sound familiar?
Specifically, throw another round item at the juggler. If I haven't
screwed up, there's only one other round item in the game. It's the
(kcor elbaulav). If you *still* can't get it to work, it's because the
rock (darn, I just ruined it) doesn't look enough like the balls. What's
special about the balls? You got it: (egnaro er'yeht). You can turn the
rock (egnaro) by painting it twice. I'm not sure that this would work in
real life, which is why I added the bit about the paint "doing funny
things sometimes" if you ask the salesman about the paint.



You can't figure out what to do with the corn dogs...

Whatever you do, don't eat them. I left the obnoxious hunger daemon out
of the game. If you chow down, the game will be unwinnable. So, what to
do? As any good American will tell you, it's nice to have money. ($8
worth, in this game) I provided a heavy-handed hint in the description
of the cart. Try selling them. If that doesn't work, it's because you're
not dressed appropriately. Would you buy a corn dog from a weirdo on the
street? Even one as good-looking as you are? A salesperson should at
least *look* official. You'll need the smock in the uniform shop. The
corn dogs should be in the cart before you try selling them.



You can't find a way to get the smock...

Did you read the description carefully when you tried to get the smock?
(You'll never get the tailor's attention, so don't bother. Not even by
dancing.) There are a number of actions in the game that your conscience
won't allow you to do. This is one of them. Is there a way around your
conscience? Maybe if you (knurd tog).



You can't figure out what to do with the whiskey...

Try drinking the whiskey again. Be sure to read the reaction carefully.
(I really did try to hint at most of the solutions in the game.)
"Straight" implies that you might be able to drink the whiskey with
something else. A (ados) will do the trick, although you'll need money
to buy one first. Once you get drunk, try acting slightly immoral. You
know -- steal some stuff. At one point, I considered running a "guilt"
daemon late in the game to make the player feel bad. I never got around
to it, though.



You can't get the goddam (or goddamn, according to my progressive
spellchecker) apple without the old man checking out your action...

You can try to take, kick, and throw stuff at the apple. You can try to
hassle the old man. None of it will work. The only way to get rid of the
old man is to satisfy his craving. Buy him a little boy! (Just kidding.
The dirty old man isn't Michael Jackson.) You'll have to scrounge up 8
bucks first. Once you get the (nig), let him have it.



I've satisfied the mechanic's requirement.  What do I do now?

Did you tell him about the parade? He's in need of a good convincing. At
this point, you should be painfully aware of your (redneg). Use it to
your advantage. (It's probably too late to warn you, but I disallowed
[kcuf] as an option. Aside from 40 goddams and 20 hells, I decided to
keep the game relatively clean.)








HOW PARADE GOT ITSELF MADE


Before I start, I want to apologize if you find this overly
self-indulgent. Personally, I enjoy behind-the-scenes analyses of
movies, books, and other kinds of arty things. I thought others might
feel the same way, so I put my thoughts to paper. If anything else, I'll
be glad to have this record for whenever I get motivated to write
another game. Here goes!

After a long break, I got back into playing interactive fiction games
late in 1996. Flames of Perdition was a whole mess of fun, but I was
impressed that games such as Wedding and Uncle Zebulon's Will were
playable, entertaining, and (most importantly of all) SHORT! I didn't
want to spend an entire year on a game (or two, or three -- you know who
you are). I figured that I could bust out a game in three weeks. And --
you know what -- I *did* bust out a game in three weeks. Version 1,
anyway.

Before I began programming, I read the manual, drew a map, and penciled
in objects and puzzles. (Not that the outline was in its the final form,
mind you. Looking over my notes, I originally included a golf course at
the eastern end of the parade and a couple of additional puzzles: (1)
stealing money from an organ grinder monkey, and (2) escaping from the
van (initially) by popping a balloon with the lighter. In case you were
wondering, I got sick of programming and canned the extra puzzles.)

The introduction was the very first thing I wrote, which is probably why
it's so damn long. One playtester complained about its length, but I
decided to leave it as-is.

Up next was the daily typing ritual. Over Christmas break, I programmed
for three weeks straight -- sometimes, up to 10 hours/day. (I'm a
college student, which was how I found the time. I originally had four
or five college references in the game, although I've since deleted most
of them. There's probably some truth to the advice about "writing what
you know", but i-f games with collegiate themes bug the hell out of me.
Kissing the Buddha's Feet is a prominent exception.) 

As a TADS beginner, I spent most of the original 3 weeks figuring out
how to implement the puzzles in TADS. I averaged about a puzzle a day.
Although most experienced programmers advise against it, my working room
descriptions were short lists of objects and actors (you know, like the
old Scott Adams type of games). I wrote most of the room descriptions
the day before I shipped out Version 1 to playtesters. Since Parade was
a relatively small game, it worked out OK. I would advise against it for
larger games.


Here are some concerns I had early on:


Since Parade takes place in the real world (sorta), I had to restrict
the player's movement with something other than cave-ins and giant
Balrogs. That's how I thought of the train. Eventually, I walled the
player in with the parade itself. 


The whole money thing was a real pain. I'm just now learning how to
program indistinguishable objects, so an entire inventory of droppable
money (both coins *and* bills) was out of the question. That's how I
came up with an undroppable wad of cash that incremented only in whole
dollar amounts.

Due the lack of female leads in i-f, I knew from the start that I wanted
the player to be a woman. Also, I thought it would be tremendously funny
to provoke a gender re- evaluation halfway through the game.


Before initial playtesting:


Heaven and hell didn't exist. (If you didn't find hell, you can get
there by trying some of the "fun stuff" that I outlined.)

The bikers (arbitrarily, I now realize) left the pub after 4 visits.
This mystified most playtesters, since there was no sign of their
departure other than a brief "The table's free!" comment when the player
re-entered the pub. The apple could be found by searching the pool table
-- it had fallen into one of the pockets. Also, in contrast to the rest
of the characters, the bikers had no personality to speak of. "Rocks"
was how one playtester described them.

I didn't nudge the player with thoughts about getting the mechanic's
attention.


After initial playtesting:


I gave the bikers personalities and made it obvious when they left the
pub. After exiting a second time, the bikers pushed the player aside and
wandered into the crowd. To find the apple, you still had to search the
pool table.

I added a ton of inspectable objects, new verbs, and minor bug fixes.
Some major bug fixes, too. If you dropped the apple in the initial
version, you could never pick it back up. "But you already have the
apple!" Oops. Also, you could get the old man wasted with the gin
without ever trying to pick up the apple. Since the player has to be
aware of his/her sex before confronting the apple-munching mechanic,
this made the game impossible to win.

I still didn't include the nudging "thoughts" about getting the
mechanic's attention. As a result, some players (still) had no idea why
the hell getting the apple was so damn important. Since getting the
apple is the motivation for the whole plot, I thought it best to pound
the player with hints if s/he didn't smack the mechanic a few times. (In
retrospect, I now see the dangers in programming a highly linear game
where leaving a single puzzle unsolved can screw up everything.)

I wrote a bunch more atmospheric texts. (e.g. "The paint salesman rolls
his eyes.") Originally, there were 5-7 per noisy room. I ended up with
10-15 per room.


Somewhere around final playtesting:   (some modifications just before, 
some just after)


I included plurals. ("The clowns doesn't appear appetizing" really
started to annoy me.)

I changed the bikers into a puzzle. Getting them to leave was no longer
arbitrary. (At this point, the afterlife already existed -- but purely
for fun. Only those players who threw something at the tank could find
it. Finally, I realized that I could tie heaven to the bikers by giving
them musical tendencies.)

I made the apple fall to the floor. At first, I left the apple on the
table when the bikers left -- until someone pointed out that you don't
need to bend over to pick up an apple off the surface of a pool table.
So, I made the apple fall off the table and wedge itself. No complaints
about apples rolling on sawdust, please.

I modified the smock slightly. Many playtesters pointed out that wearing
the (originally tight) smock was a valid solution to the wedged apple
puzzle. I got around this by (1) making the smock loose and (2)
generating an appropriate message when the player goes for the apple
while wearing the smock. Unfair? Maybe so.

I added in a few other comedy bits (esp. the Giant Sack).

I downsized the Mound of Quartz room description. The original Mound of
Quartz room description included the information that now pops up when
you inspect the upper class. It was overwhelming (still is, maybe),
which is why I backgrounded the unnecessary detail. Also, I moved the
ATM machine from the Mound of Quartz to the Minimall Entrance to make
the Quartz room description more manageable.

Likewise, because I was unhappy with my writing, I erased or relocated
most of the original Uniform Shop room description. The wind, ghost, and
ominously looming objects are brand new. (Not even seen by the final
playtesters, actually. I bet that's how typos creep in.)

On one playtester's suggestion, I disallowed the use of "all" with
nearly every verb: all but 'get', 'put', 'take', and 'drop'. The
playtester had used "smell all" as a way to get a quick list of every
inspectable object. He had even solved the perfect note puzzle this way.
(Note, however, that the use of "examine all" allowed early playtesters
to figure out which items I accidentally omitted from room descriptions.
In Version 1, I had forgotten to include the bulletin board (Rock
Museum) and desk (Garage).)


Most playtesters still didn't like the late revelation of the player's
sex. (Which can come *really* late now that getting the bikers to leave
is a puzzle.) After wavering back and forth for a couple of weeks, I
decided not to give in to peer pressure. 

On the suggestion of playtesters, I added in a few more things for the
player to do when drunk (jumping over the puddle and reading the porno
mag, in particular).

I included standard TADS instructions (with a few minor changes to
interactions with characters) just because I could.

Hell was created for my own amusement.  Since there's a heaven, why not?


Changes for v2.2:

I corrected a major bug in the pub. Before the bug fix, TADS allowed
players to "show" every visible item. Thus, it was possible for the
offended biker to grind the bartender, the old man, and the pool table
beneath his boot. Man, that's one powerful boot. 

I made it easier to get to hell. Rather than solve the puzzles in a
particular order, the player can now get to hell by throwing an object
at the tank *after* stealing the smock. Jumping over the puddle while
drunk now transports the player to limbo. You can also get to limbo by
riding the train. Thanks to Admiral Jota for the smock-stealing
suggestion.

The player can now become a hobo by climbing on the train. I did this
mainly as a programming exercise to see if I could get the train to
start and stop like the elephant in Graham Nelson's "The Meteor, the
Stone, and the Tall Glass of Sherbet." (Sorry if I remembered the title
incorrectly.) Thanks to Stephen Granade for the train-hopping
suggestion.


Closing comments:

The playtesting and revising of games takes a *lot* of time. Version 1
(130k) came out in January. The first public version of Parade (Version
2.1 @ 264k) came out in March 1997. Before the final release, I must
have played my own game 30 damn times. At least.

Finally, writing this game was a lot of fun! Give it a try! To this end,
here are a few hints for those who want to give TADS a try. I highly
recommend it. (To help persuade you, keep in mind that, before TADS, my
last bout with programming was a beginning Pascal course in 1986.) 


TADS ADVICE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMERS:


If you think it'll help, I'd be glad to share code with anyone
interested in programming. Otherwise, here are some helpful hints for
hopeful programmers:


1. The Synonym and -> shortcuts save a lot of typing. Use 'em whenever
possible.

2. Programming doVerbPrep(actor,iobj) stuff is a real pain (as in "cover
puddle with sawdust", where "puddle" is the important object for the
verb). Redirect the ioVerbPrep action to the doVerbPrep like it says in
the Book of the Parser. Otherwise, the doVerbPrep never gets accessed.
(Can you say 2 wasted hours? I can.)

3. Take care of important details as you stumble across them. Don't wait
until later! For example, I programmed the responses to the improper use
of the paint machine (while the safety door was open, etc.) because I
knew that I would forget later on. Your playtesters will get cranky if
you don't anticipate these details. Speaking of which...

4. Use playtesters. They're nuts, but they're a big help. Like I said,
Version 1 was only 130k.

5. Use the plurals.t module on ftp.gmd.de if you want to incorporate
plurals. (Don't forget bugs.t, too!) This module may become pronouns.t
in the future.

6. Be sure that you don't modify a class property (the container class
verDoLookin property, e.g.) more than once. Unfortunately, the compiler
doesn't warn you when this happens; it just keeps the latest
modification.

7. In a related topic, be sure to check ADV.T before you modify a class
property. You might wipe out something important. (By the way, both
ADV.T and STD.T are worth a good look before you start.)

8. Unless you modify ADV.T, TADS allows players to "put" things that
they aren't carrying. This can lead to serious bugs if you forget to
block the "put" verb for inaccessible items (a wedged apple, for
instance). If you don't believe me, put the bush from Unnkulian I in the
bucket. Or, put the gold bar, anchor, or bookmark from Unnkulian II on
the went board. My solution was to forbid the player from "putting"
anything that he or she isn't carrying; Inform does the same thing. (I
should know, since I stole Inform's default "put" response.)

9. If you replace the default ldesc (long description) of a surface or
container object, any attempt to look in or search the container/surface
will call up the response "There's nothing on/in the surface/container."
Silly, I know. Bugs.t repairs this oversight.

10. If you want to trigger a daemon more than once, don't forget to
reset its counter to zero.

11. Watch James Cagney movies. Public Enemy, Strawberry Blonde, and
White Heat are good places to start.

12. If you replace one object with another (a live monkey with a dead
one, for example), don't forget to setit(new_object). This way, the
pronoun "it" will refer to the new object.

13. Create separate files (verbs.t, modifications.t, actors.t,
paint_shop.t, etc.) from the very beginning. This makes it *much* easier
to locate code for future revisions.

14. It's your own damn game. Do whatever the hell you want.

15. Read the manual and download lots of source code. If that doesn't
work, don't be afraid to look like an idiot on rec.arts.i-f. I'll be
glad to keep you company.

       Rakish Walkthrough
           By Anon

       (written with the invaluable
          aid of Nigel Downes)


Rakish is a TADS text adventure of an adult nature, written by Nigel Downes.
The introductory paragraph says it best, so here it is:

  In this adventure you take the role of a flirtatious and somewhat
  notorious english nobleman on holiday in France.  As well as all
  the typical Adventure commands (Take, Give, Examine, Look) you may
  well need some slightly less obvious instructions (especially those
  regarding the fairer sex...).  One other point to bear in mind,
  Gentlemen may Fence but they rarely simply Attack.  On with the show....


A few things not mentioned in this paragraph are two very important
commands.  The first is common in TADS games, which is "TALK TO X"
where X is a character name.  With this command, you can figure out
the game and complete it, but most likely not score above 50/100 points.

The second is a special command for this game, that being "SPANK X", where
X is again a character name.  With these two commands you should be able
to complete the game with a full score of 100 points...  However, if you
are stuck, a blatant walkthrough is listed below.

Also note that there is a bug in the game which allows you to amass a
score well above 100.  Giving anything to Alicia will increment your
score by +15 points (possibly dependent on TADS runtime version) while
only one particular item in the game should give you 15 points when
you give it to Alicia (don't worry, YOU'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT,
and it's in the walkthrough).

Full walkthrough for rematch.

REmatch, as you know, is a one move game.  If you and your friends survive this one 
turn, you will win. However, it takes exactly nine moves minimum to deduce the 
information needed for the winning move.  This walkthrough shows you alll nine 
moves.

1/1

>sw

You will see a guy get mad at his table number being called, and get ready to smash 
his cue stick into a control panel.  However, someone else will stop him, and tell 
him that it wasn't his table, which it wasn't. Write down the number of that table.

Nick and Ines get killed. You lose.  type "auto"

2/2

>s

You will see that one ceiling fan is very rickety, and right in front of the pane 
of glass where the SUV goes through. if someone could just make it fall, it would 
scare people away from the front, and save lives...

All three of you die. You lose. Game auto-restarts.

3/3
>se

Here you see a distracted cashier, who hears someone shouting a number, and then 
mistakenly calls to that table, saying that their time is up. This is why the 
person got mad earlier. If you could just get her to say the number from 
earlier...

Nick and Ines get killed again.... you know the drill.

4/4

>w

Here, you see the loudmouth, who shouts a movie name with a *number* in it. Funny 
enough, the cashier lady call *that number*.  

You know the drill.

5/5

> look in ines's knapsack.

You see a cellphone, some tennis balls, and a far-side calendar.  perhaps the 
calendar deserves a closer look.

You know the drill...

6/6

>look at farside calendar

Unlike most of them, this one has each day with it's own number, so it has all the 
numbers from 1 to 365 on it.  Aha!  This calendar has the number from earlier.  But 
now what?

7/7

>ask ines about loudmouth.

They talk about how annoying he is, and how she'd like to throw something at him.

By now, you should realise a few things.  Ines will do *anything* that Nick dares 
her to.  Trying to dare Ines yourself doesn't work. Nick must do it. But if you 
tell nick to do it, she'll hear. So you must whisper to nick to dare ines to...

8/8
>whisper to nick to dare ines to throw eight ball at loudmouth.

Well, just as they predicted he says the number on the ball. Aha!  So if you could 
get the calendar page to him, he'd probably make a remark like "Far Side Calendar 
page <XXX>, the best cartoon of all time?!?!?"  But those calendar pages are too 
flimsy to throw. You'd need to throw it with a ball. But he always says the number 
on the ball... what do you do?

9/9

>.whisper to nick to dare ines to throw cueball at loudmouth.

Right, the ball with no number on it!  This is what you will use to send the 
far side page!

About here you get told the Deja vu message.  This time, the table number you got 
from step one will be the one near the panel! So now, we know what to do to break 
the cycle.

10/1

> whisper to nick to dare ines to throw page <xxx> at loudmouth with cueball

If you were to try this on any other time in the cycle, it would fail, and you'd 
need a different number.  Congrats. this is probably the longest adventure game 
sentence you've EVER had to type to complete a game. :)
Walkthrough for Room 206 v.2
A Harrowing Reflection on Horror, Death, and Love by Byron Alexander Campbell

NOTE: this walkthrough applies to Version 2 of the ALAN release of Room 206.  The precise solutions may not apply to later or earlier versions, or releases in a different format.  Also note that this plot-driven tale relies on a precisely timed series of scenes or events to proceed.  There will be times (indicated with a 'z' for 'wait') when a certain number of turns, rather than a specific action, will be required for the next event to occur.  While you can spend those turns however you like, I highly recommend taking every opportunity to examine and interact with anything and everything in sight.  The person who simply does what needs to be done to "win" won't get nearly as much out of this story as the person who explores every nook and cranny of the Room and its surrounding spaces.

Room 206 is light on puzzles, and death should never occur, but there are a few times you'll be asked to perform action that might not be immediately apparent.  You might also hesitate when the way forward seems clear, but morally ambiguous.  This walkthrough should help with those moments.

(note: during this puzzle the mystery man will occasionally call in to provide hints, depending on your progress.  While these are intended to help solve the puzzle, they also expand the story in their own way; it may be worth waiting around to hear all four of them before you start the following actions)

(note: the seagull's actions are random, but basically you need to wait until it has thrown itself against the window enough times for it to shatter)

(note: in this section you have a choice that will help determine which ending you receive.  You can continue beating the man, even though he has stopped talking, or you can wait until the drapes rustle, allowing you to exit the room)

(note: here's another choice that will determine your ending.  "say guilty" or "say innocent," whichever you think is correct)
once the door is open:

(note: you're now in a pseudo-maze.  The solution is random; just go in the direction of the light.  If a direction doesn't work, use the synonym listed in the room description)

THE WEDDING WAS LIKE A DREAM...
On Saturday.
------------

This is a day for general stuff. To prepare the way. Very few
puzzles actually need doing today. Most of this stuff can be put
off.

Once you wake up from your dream. (cast the WOO spell and make a
move on the girl).

GET BOOK. D. NE. SIT. Once all is loaded on the carpet. the carpet
controls come on. TAKE OFF. Follow the directions in the DOX.TXT
file. Print that file up. It is very useful.

Once you get to Fort Naughtytail, you will have to push everything
off the carpet. Push the stuff off in whatever order you want. You
will find it all by the end on Monday anyway and the only things
you really need are the trunk and the lotion.

The game will carry you along until the confrontation with GLY.
Then cast the FRIMP spell on each barbell (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)
just before he tries to lift them. FRIMP takes time to recharge so
only cast when he is standing before each barbell.

Go to the souvenir shop. (There is a mapping function in the game
so I will not give specific directions to most places). Near the
Hotel. Buy the UPPSSY spell.

Open all spell boxes if you have the book with you, this writes the
spell in the book for multiple uses.

Then go to the Casino near the center of the village. Cast the
UPPSSY spell on the casino (UPPSSY CASINO), when you are outside.
This makes it no longer "crooked" both literally and figuratively.
Then save the game and go in and PLAY RUELOTTO. Bet on number 6
until you win or have bet six times. If you win go outside and save
the game. If you lose restore. Remember if you didn't cast the
UPPSSY spell you can never win in the casino. Get about 1800 or so
gold. This will be as much as you need for the whole game. It takes
patience but it is worth it in the long run.

Once you have 1800 gold. Buy the key from the rummy in the
groggery.

Buy the slimfish from the fish stand in the fish market.

Go to the mouth of the cave and get the haunch. Take it to the end
of the road (From mouth of cave S.S.SW.)

Drop the haunch. Tomorrow there will be a hole under the fence.

Get the gloves batman dropped at the cliff road. At the bottom of
the cliff you will find one of the things you pushed overboard.

Go to the open shops (Pawnshop, hardware store and souvenir) BUY
ALL in each store except the pawnshop. There BUY BOX,BOMB. OPEN
BOX.

Leave everything but the BOOK AND SHOVEL in the lobby. Go to the
seafood restaurant (the TOURIST TRAP). SIT. ORDER BISQUE. when the
bisque gets there EAT BISQUE. GET ALL. N. The sheriff will bust you
for the first of many times in the game. To get out of jail. DIG.

Go to the hotel lobby and GO TO ROOM 911. Wait until someone offers
to sell you a good ticket and BUY TICKET. When your turn comes go
in. OPEN SUITCASE. OPEN RATANT BOX.

Go to the lighthouse at the jetty end. UP. Get bulb. Get treatise.

Go to the fort. L IN CANNON. GET MOSS.

Go to the lobby. DROP ALL. If you followed all instructions (and
had enough time) then the following items should be there.

Go to the END OF THE ROAD. The dog has vanished as has the haunch.
go through the hole in the fence. (W).

Open the box. (SPUNJ SPELL)

Go west to enter maze game. One way of winning at the hard level

SLAP THAT FISH OVERFISHING GUIDE
by Michael Martin

GENERAL STRATEGY

Slap That Fish is a series of battles for the fate of yourself, your
honor, and all mankind, against legions of fish.  Although, as the
game progresses, you will begin to face enemies that are actually item
usage puzzles, the core of the game (and what your score is ultimately
based on) is a resource management puzzle; the general goal is to
trade stamina for damage as efficiently as possible.

BASIC ATTACKS

You have four basic attacks (ATTACK FISH will cue you with them):
PUNCH, KICK, SLAP, and BACKHAND.  If they connect, they generally
charge you two stamina and inflict two damage.  KICKs are more likely
to be evaded by smaller fish, and evaded kicks in particular will
generally only cost you a single stamina point.

COMBINATION ATTACKS

The cost of a basic attack can vary based on the last few moves you've
done; this will either deliver extra damage or cost you less stamina
to perform.  For example, against most enemies you can use the basic
"one-two": if you follow up a SLAP with a BACKHAND, the BACKHAND will
cost only 1 Stamina but inflict 3 damage.  Thus "slap/backhand" is a
combo that costs 3 and inflicts 5.

The difference in combat effectiveness is significant; against the
first opponent (the rainbow trout, who has no counters other than
immunity to kicks): with a sequence of nothing but slaps, you will
need to attack five times and expend 10 endurance to defeat him. As
you start with only five endurance, this works out to 10 turns of
battle and five attacks. However, if you instead use one-two combos,
you can inflict 10 damage in two iterations, and this means you only
need to rest for a single turn, between the two combinations.

Running out of stamina partway through a combo will interrupt the
combo and is always bad.

Different fish have different combinations against which they are
vulnerable. Pay attention to the text you get, as combinations in
progress usually have some special text that seem to indicate that a
move was unusually effective. This is worthwhile even if it looks like
there's been no extra damage or lesser stamina cost; sometimes
completing a combo will trigger a plot event or environmental effect
that will deal loads of damage.  If it looks like a combination hasn't
paid off, it's probable that you just haven't extended it far enough
yet.

Moves that do not finish a combination but are nevertheless part of
them may actually not do damage; replies to these often will mention
something about the fish becoming exposed or moving into a new
position that will suggest a followup.

OPTIMIZING YOUR SCORE

The scoring itself is based on, effectively, damage per second (DPS)
and damage per attack (DPA); it's computed based on how long it takes,
and how many attacks it took, to take down your foe. Because of the
combat and stamina regeneration model, however, optimizing damage per
endurance (DPE) - the most damage for the least stamina cost - will
usually optimize both, and so this is the statistic to focus on
primarily.

Some items will change the damage of your basic attacks; this may
change the total efficiency calculus if you have endurance to
burn. There is also a point in the game where you can get a full
stamina recharge, which will be necessary to get a perfect score in
its fight.

It is usually unnecessary to spend the between-fight times preparing
items for the next fight, but it also rarely hurts. When working for a
perfect run, save immediately after the ends of fights, not at the
beginnings of the next ones.

PER-FISH HINTS

Trout:        This is a practice fight. Get your combos going, and make
              every move count. If you can't perfect this guy, you may
              have trouble doing damage fast enough to the enemies
              that will actually fight back.

Bass:         Examining the situation and reacting appropriately will
              yield more damage faster than just attacking blindly.

Clownfish:    This enemy can be one-shotted. Think outside the box.

Catfish:      Just because a move has done no damage doesn't mean it's
              not part of a combo.

Tuna:         Long, repetitive combos can end with a sizable bang.

Swordfish:    Make your combos last as long as they possibly can. Also,
              do not run out of stamina while performing them or you
              may trigger a game-breaking bug in version 1.1.

Pufferfish:   You can't touch it directly. Keep the pressure on and
              don't let it close.

Shark:        This is a puzzle battle, but keep your combos in mind.

Electric Eel: Protection is available. You'll need to prepare in
              advance to overcome its defenses fast enough for a
              perfect score. Fortunately, you can rest as much as you
              want before he shows up.

Piranha:      Mix it up! You cannot safely do any move more than twice. The
              crowd's chant gives you key to a flawless victory, but
              you'll need to make sure your stamina is at least half
              full before you make the first move.

Anglerfish:   In defeating the piranha, you will have improved your
              basic attack damage. For once, combos are not the whole
              of the answer, even once the puzzles are solved.

Coelacanth:   To complete this battle as rapidly as possible, you will
              need to have satisfied your winning combination's
              preconditions in advance.

OPTIMUM COMBINATION VALUES

These are targets to shoot for for a maximum score. Some fights may
require you to prepare in advance during the inter-fight
sequences. Others may actually be beaten by careful use of preparation
or foreknowledge.

Trout: 5 turns, 4 attacks
Bass: 8 turns, 3 attacks 
Clownfish: 1 turn, 0 attacks
Catfish: 9 turns, 6 attacks
Tuna: 20 turns, 10 attacks
Swordfish: 22 turns, 11 attacks
Pufferfish: 16 turns, 6 attacks

Walkthrough for
SPECULATIVE FICTION
by Diane Christoforo and Thomas Mack
(This walkthrough is by us, that is. But we wrote the game too.)


RORY: Hi, everybody, and welcome to the annotated walkthrough for Speculative Fiction! Whether you're stuck in the game, or just curious to see if you missed anything, we hope this walkthrough will be a fun and educational experience! I'm Rory. I play W.D. in the game. 
MARTIN: And I'm Martin. I play the wizard. 
RORY: The wizard doesn't officially have a name, but we like to refer to him as Bill. 
MARTIN: I prefer Frederick, but we're never going to agree on this one. Anyway, let's get started. You begin the game in Not a---
RORY: Wait. We should explain how this works, first. This walkthrough is divided into a number of parts. 

In Part 1, we'll try to determine who we are, why we're here, and what our goals are. 

In Part 2, we'll do a general exploration of the game map, and pick up any freely-available objects. 

In Part 3, we'll solve the easier puzzles. These are pretty straightforward. You'll need to bring a few objects to the right location and combine them. 

In Part 4, we'll solve the harder puzzles. These puzzles have multiple stages, require timing, or both. 

In Part 5, we'll solve the endgame. Now, the endgame _is_ timed, but it's also pretty simple, so this bit shouldn't take too long. 

If we have time, in Part 6 we'll talk about interesting actions you may want to try, some of which will be hazardous to Bill's health, or to W.D.'s. I should mention that this walkthrough will strive to be pretty thorough - we'll mention actions a player might take even if they're not strictly necessary - examining objects and such. 

MARTIN: But then you'd miss out on all the behind-the-scenes gossip. 

PART 1: WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE

MARTIN: We begin the game in Not a Dungeon. Your first goal is to figure out what's going on. 

> x me

MARTIN: Ok, that's kind of a strange description. You get told that your body is unconscious, but you're giving commands to someone or something. 

Let's see what else is in the room. 

> x vase
> take vase

MARTIN: We'll need this vase eventually, so we're going to take it now. 
RORY: I really hate that vase. 
MARTIN: I know, but we need it for full points. 
RORY: Bleh. What else is in this room? 

> x tapestry
> x inscription

RORY: This is just flavor, but it lets you know a little bit about the backstory. Let's check out the body. 

> x body

RORY: That's the same description as "x me". So who's driving this thing? 

> look in mirror

RORY: And there I am! Aren't I awesome? 
MARTIN: As a side note, "x you" also describes W.D. Let's examine Frederick the wizard some more.

> x robe
> look in pockets
> take wand
> x wand

RORY: Yay! Magic items! 

> wake wizard  

MARTIN: Now you have some more idea what's going on. Your mind is inside W.D., giving him directions. 
The vase and the wand are the only objects you can get in the room, so it's time to escape. 

> x door
> open door

RORY: W.D. can't get through the door, because he's a bird. On the other hand, he's a bird. 

> x window
> fly out window

RORY: And with a big WOOOSH, W.D. is free. "d" doesn't work to get out of the room initially, but once you've escaped for the first time, you can use "u" and "d" to go between Not a Dungeon and Castle Gate. 
MARTIN: I have to say, this was probably the hardest scene in the game for me to film. You'd think lying there would be easy, but it's really hard to be still! At least Fred's only supposed to be unconscious, so I could still breathe. 
RORY: There was that one session where you kept laughing. 
MARTIN: You examined the tapestry thirty times in a row! Maybe Frederick was having a funny dream. 
RORY: Well, his brain is in W.D.'s bag, so I don't see how - 
MARTIN: *cough* Anyway, we eventually got the scene filmed. At this point, W.D. is in Castle Gate and ready to explore the game world proper. 
RORY: Unfortunately, W.D. cannot break down the doors of the castle, so the relevant thing to see here is the tree. 

> x tree
> climb tree

MARTIN: This brings us to the top of the tree. You can see a fair amount of the map from here. 

> x stall
> x castle
> x magic
> x farm

RORY: This area's here to give you a feel for the map. Note that when you examine the magic shop, W.D. says, "We should go there to ask for advice."
MARTIN: There's one other thing here. Don't forget the note. 
RORY: Right, right. 

> take note
> read note

RORY: So one of those pesky tree-climbing humans has left a treasure hunt for his girlfriend. We'll be following it later. 
MARTIN: Fun fact: the models of the other game locations which you can see here? Ken in costuming made them. He makes dollhouses as a hobby. He's working on a replica of the whole game world now. 
RORY: Wow. I didn't know that. Cool. 
MARTIN: Yeah, I learned a lot of neat things about the crew while waiting to film my scenes. 
RORY: I kind of regret not being able to hang out with people more, but I was on camera basically the whole time. Anyway, we should probably take a break from the shop talk. People are trying to win this thing. So! Mel will give us advice, so that's where we should head.

> n

MARTIN: Now we're at the south part of Big Street. Mel's is off of the center section. You'll notice there's a beggar here - 

> x beggar

RORY: But we're going to skip the beggar for now. At this point, it's not entirely clear what we're up to. We'll come back once we have a reason to bug this guy. 

> n

RORY: This is Big Street, Center. It is the greatest location in the game, because it contains Sandie's Hot Meats. Tragically, we need to skip it for now and go to Mel's. 

> e

MARTIN: The room description of the magic shop starts to explain what we're doing: "We're here to ask Mel for a Midas potion." 
RORY: Now, the very first action you take in the magic shop is going to be intercepted by a cut-scene, so we'll just look at the room again. 

> l 

RORY: And here's your plot dump. Now, that was a lot of text, so let me summarize:
   1.) Bill the wizard has been embezzling and just got caught. 
   2.) The treasurer has to go find the king to get Bill executed.
   3.) Bill needs to fill the treasury back up before that happens. 
   4.) If we get Mel lots and lots and lots of money, he will sell us the ingredients to make a potion that turns all the fake treasure in the treasury to gold.    
   5.) Profit.
MARTIN: I think that's the first time I've seen one of those lists where the item before "Profit" isn't "???". 
RORY: Well, it's, "Get Mel lots and lots of money", which might as well be "???"
MARTIN: I guess it wouldn't be a game if it were obvious. So, there are a lot of things going on in this location. First, Mel speaks Raven. He's the one NPC you can have real conversations with. 

> ask mel about money
> ask mel about wizard
> ask mel about wand
> ask mel about potion

RORY: Some of these are hints, and some are just flavor. If you haven't already tried waving the wand, you should do that. About half of the responses in "ask mel about money" actually correspond to things you can do in game. He also has opinions on many of the other NPCs. 
MARTIN: Including a backhanded compliment about poor Frederick. Sniff sniff. 
RORY: Also, this is where we'll come back to in order to cash in completed puzzles. It's also where we'll make the Midas potion. That will be later, though. 
MARTIN: There are also several items in the shop. The cockroaches are there to look cool. The trinkets we'll deal with later. We can take the balloon now. Then we'll head off to the southeast corner of the shop. 
RORY: Yeah - now that we know the plot, we're going to do a rapid-fire run through of the map, taking objects and looking for puzzle pointers. 

PART 2: RUN AROUND THE MAP AND TAKE STUFF

> take balloon
> se

RORY: The alchemy bench is full of items which aren't nailed down. We'll take all of them. 

> x dye
> take dye
> x clear
> take clear
> x book
> read book
> read page

MARTIN: There are three bottles of blue dye, but we're going to solve the puzzles in an order such that we only need one. You can come back here if you use up or destroy a bottle. (Or you can just take all three at once.) Also, we don't need the whole spellbook; just the relevant page. 
RORY: The solvent actually works, if you're wondering. The prop for the spellbook is now blank due to an accident with the "clear fluid". 
MARTIN: Rory carefully neglects to mention who caused the accident. 
RORY: HEY GUYS I SPILLED THE SOLVENT ON THE BOOK. ::cough:: 

> nw
> w
> s

MARTIN: We're back at Big Street, South. Let's check out the beggar in more detail. 

> x beggar
> x cup
> look in cup
> x strange
> take strange

RORY: Okay, so the beggar can hear us, but not see us. He's got some kind of rare coin, but we can't get it from him yet. 

> n
> x stall
> x sandie
> x pans
> excitement pan
> ask sandie about meat

MARTIN: Sandie can't speak Raven, but she does know who we are. There are a couple of NPCs who know that W.D. is a special raven and will treat him a little bit more like a person. 

> take salt

RORY: There's salt and pepper here. I'm cheating a bit in that I know we'll need the salt and won't need the pepper. But hey, that's why you're reading a walkthrough--- for the delicious cheating. There's infinite salt here, but you can only take one packet at a time. If you use it up, you can come back to Sandie's to get another packet. 
MARTIN: I need to interrupt for a minute and put a plug in for Alessandra, here. She plays Sandie, and she was an absolute _delight_ to work with. She's professional, she's funny ... if you are trying to write a female character in your game and you need someone, I really recommend her work. 
RORY: I have to second that. We tried to get her in here to help with the walkthrough, but she's got a gig as an evil sorceress in a dungeon crawl right now. 
MARTIN: The salt is the only thing we really need here for now, so it's off towards Moneyville.

> n

RORY: This area is _mostly_ a hub. There's one thing to check out:

> x cord
> pull cord

MARTIN: Well, that's exciting! We'll be back to deal with the cord in more detail later. Conveniently, we've been moved to the Bank Lobby. 

> x forms
> x poster
> x man
> take poster

MARTIN: All humans look kind of alike to W.D. 
RORY: Which is speciesism. 
MARTIN: Anyway, we can take the poster. It describes Two-Handed Bart, horrible bank robber. 
RORY: "Horrible" because he's bad at it. 
MARTIN: What? No, no, the fact that he robs banks is horrible ... er, moving on.

> e
> x teller
> ask teller about loan

RORY: The teller doesn't speak Raven. If we want to communicate with her, we'll need another way. 

> x chandelier

MARTIN: Here's the cord we saw outside the bank earlier.

> x cord

RORY: We'll see the cord in the guard tower too. It's the bank's alarm system. 

> break cord

RORY: But we can't do anything about it from here. 

> w
> n

MARTIN: This is the Stock Market. There's an auction going on.

> x auctioneer
> x coffer
> x merchants

RORY: There are also a lot of animals. 

> x animals
> animals, hi

RORY: Some of the animals are pretty nervous.
MARTIN: If you stick around for a few turns, you can watch the auctions going on. For now, there aren't any objects we can take. 

> sw 
> w

RORY: Mindo Street lets us get into the guard tower, and also has a cool statue. 
MARTIN: I hear the statue is actually modeled after the father of one of the writers, as a sort of cameo. 
RORY: Really? I heard it was the set designer's ex. 
MARTIN: Huh. Well, it's someone. 

> x statue
> x plaque

RORY: Cute. Time for the guard tower. 

> n
> x bell

MARTIN: Here's the last part of the alarm system. If you try to ring the bell from in here, you just annoy the guard. 

> x guard
> x mustache
> take mustache

RORY: Sound sleeper. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that's artistic license. I tried that thing on. It _hurts_. 

> x wastebasket
> take vellum
> read vellum
> x signature

RORY: Apparently Bill the Wizard was up to something other than just embezzling pre-game. 
MARTIN: This letter relates to a mysterious device which we'll see in a few turns.

> x tunic
> take key

RORY: I'm now going to show you the evidence cabinet and then walk you through two ways of not opening it. 

> x cabinet
> x crack
> look in crack

MARTIN: You can't examine the scrap and the device without opening the cabinet, which you can't do yet. 

> x lock
> break lock

RORY: That's Failure 1.

> unlock lock with key

RORY: And that's Failure 2. 

> give key to guard

MARTIN: Say it with me, folks: "We'll be back to deal with this later." We're giving the key back to the guard now because he's the only person who can open the cabinet. 

> up

RORY: Now we're at the barracks. We can finally take some more objects. 

> x blanket
> take blanket
> take bit

MARTIN: Mmm, a smelly blanket.

> x guard
> x forms
> x stamp

RORY: The signature is, in fact, the treasurer's.

> x guard
> x tunic
> take pouch
> open pouch
> take florin

RORY: They really don't hire the guards for their alertness, do they? 
MARTIN: The guy's been stamping paperwork for sixteen hours. 
RORY: I guess. As we learned with the guard downstairs, tunics contain exciting objects. This guard has ... A SINGLE FLORIN!!! Our first real money!
MARTIN: Don't try to turn the florin in to Mel, though. We'll need to turn one florin into many before we have anything worthwhile. 
RORY: Off to the last few game locations. 

> d
> s
> w

MARTIN: Ah, the sea.

> take rod
> x rod
> wave rod

RORY: The fishing wand generates a variety of forms of bait. 

> eat <bait>

RORY: We're going to eat the bait to get rid of it for now. Our props deparment failed to get us duplicates of some relevant items - there's only one "salt" and one "faery coin" and one "bait", so you won't be able to get another one until you dispose of the first one. 
MARTIN: Yeah, in an ironic twist, it turned out a certain someone was stealing from the props budget...
RORY: Legally, we can't mention her name, but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Also it rhymes with "Mendolyn". 

> x scarecrow

MARTIN: The end of that description is not a typo. 

> x hat
> take hat

RORY: For convenience, you can refer to it as a hat. 
MARTIN: So what's up with the circle and the barrel? 

> read sign
> x circle
> x barrel
> take fish
> enter circle
> take fish
> eat fish

RORY: I would like to point out that I am claustrophobic and this was not fun to film. I'm going to go get some air. Martin, you deal with this bit. 
MARTIN: Ok. So W.D. is trapped in a magical cage. 

> x cage
> open cage
> e
> z
> z
> z

MARTIN: It doesn't open on its own. (We filmed a scene where if you waited for twenty turns, a fisherman would come and throw you into the ocean. That got cut for being too gruesome.) Violence turns out to be the solution to this one. 

> break cage
> break cage
> break cage

MARTIN: W.D. can break out in 1 to 3 turns, so you may have to try multiple times. Now we have a treacherous source of fish. 

> exit circle
> e
> sw 

MARTIN: Hey, Rory - we're at the Farmland. You can come back. Rory? Hrm. From the farmland, we can go into the cottage or over to the barn. There's also a hedgehog. 

> x hedgehog
> hedgehog, hi

MARTIN: The hedgehog and W.D. can understand each other, but communication is still difficult. The notable thing here is that the hedgehog is hungry. 

> s

MARTIN: If you've played the Introcomp release, you probably remember the cottage. In the full game, there's a second room further to the south. 

First, let's check out the fireplace. We can ignore the farming tools. 

> x fireplace
> x chimney
> take brick
> take parchment
> x parchment

MARTIN: If you remember all the way back to "ask mel about money", he does happen to mention insurance fraud. 

> x scarf
> take scarf

MARTIN: Fashion!

> w
> x basket
> x lever
> pull lever

MARTIN: W.D. has a serious egg problem.

> take egg

MARTIN: Really serious. 

> pull lever
> pull lever
> pull lever
> pull lever
> take egg

MARTIN: _Really_ serious. There are an infinite number of eggs and W.D. has infinite stomach capacity. Hm. Is Rory back? No? Rory got _really_ sick doing this scene. Rory does not have infinite stomach capacity. 

> e
> n
> w

MARTIN: This brings us to the barn, which is the final location in the main map. Here we have a beautiful, brand-new building, which we now know was just insured for some amount of money, hopefully a large amount. Our path is clear. 
RORY: I'm back! I brought coffee. I got you a latte. 
MARTIN: Thanks, Rory. Also, good timing. I was just about to start solving puzzles. 
RORY: Awesome. Time to burn down the barn? 
MARTIN: Time to burn down the barn. 

PART 3: TIME TO BURN DOWN THE BARN, AND OTHER SIMPLE PUZZLES

RORY: If you've jumped straight to Part 3, we're at the Barn. 

> x hay

RORY: This hay is very dry. It would be a shame if something happened to it. 
MARTIN: Now, we don't directly have a fire source, but if you examine our vast pile of objects, we do have an explosion source. 
RORY: (If you haven't already waved the magic wand to get a faery coin, you should do that now.) 

> wave wand
> take coin
> x coin
> x salt

MARTIN: Faery coins explode if you put salt on them. We have salt. Now, it's not a very big explosion; don't go thinking you can blow off the castle doors. But this hay is quite dry ... 

> put faery on hay
> put salt on faery

RORY: And now we _leave_. 
MARTIN: If you're feeling suicidal, you can stand there and watch W.D. burn to death, but we like winning. 
RORY: And in case you're worrying that I have a poor charred stunt double somewhere, _that_ scene was CGI. 

> e

MARTIN: In your playthrough, we encourage you to stop at Farmland and watch the barn burn down, but we're going to get a move on. 
RORY: This next bit is different from Introcomp. In the initial release, there was an insurance salesman at the stock market who you could turn the policy into. Now you'll need to turn it in at the bank. 

> e
> n
> n
> n
> e
> e
> give parchment to teller

RORY: Yay money!
MARTIN: I'm going to walk you through giving the check to Mel now. This will teach you about buying ingredients. After this, we'll just hold them till the end. 

> w
> w
> s
> e
> give check to mel

MARTIN: Now you've gotten the right to buy one ingredient. For full points, you'll need to buy all seven. You can win the game starting with the four-ingredient potion. 
RORY: If you are playing the game on your own and not just following the walkthrough, we recommend not buying any ingredients until you've given up on puzzles. 
MARTIN: Right. The five-ingredient potion needs a different set from the four-ingredient potion. So you don't want to buy three ingredients and then realize they're only useful if you manage to finish all seven puzzles. 

> buy ingredient
> midas potion

RORY: We're actually saying "Midas potion" here because that backs you out of the buying dialog. We've successfully gotten the check out of our inventory; we'll buy all seven ingredients at once later. 

MARTIN: Now we'll do Puzzle 2: The Riddle Trail.
RORY: This is the puzzle connected to the red note. Each note clues a location in the game. You go there and get the next note. Repeat. 

> read red note

MARTIN: We're told to go to the left elbow of Blue Fever's brother. If you'll recall, Blue Fever is mentioned on the plaque underneath the statue on Mindo Street. 

> w
> n 
> w
> x left elbow
> take violet note
> read violet note

RORY: We saw forms in the bank.

> e
> e
> search forms for x1-fsb

MARTIN: The treasure hunt involves a couple of uses of "search X for Y".
RORY: This is about two hundred commands too late, but if you haven't tried "ABOUT" by now, it points you to"ABOUT VERBS", which lists some verbs you might not otherwise think to try. 

> take green note
> read green note

RORY: There is only one place in town that contains pans of meat. You'll notice the note doesn't specify which kind of meat is the favorite, but there are only three options. 
MARTIN: Also, it's the pork pan, to save you two commands. 

> w
> s
> look under pork pan
> take yellow note
> read yellow note

RORY: I am sorry to say that the only purpose the Exploding Cockroaches serve in this game is to point you back to Mel's via this note. 
MARTIN: Yeah, this was a missed opportunity. One of the script editors said there were plans for a big bug race, but, you know, budget issues...

> e
> search trinkets for cedar
> take cedar
> open cedar
> take ring

MARTIN: We're bad people. 
RORY: It's in a pile of things in a store. What's to say someone completely innocent didn't buy it by accident? Also, yeah, we're bad people. 

> give ring to mel 

MARTIN: Might as well get rid of the ring, since we're right here. 
RORY: We actually talked about this at the cast party and we decided that Mel is totally on to you and just doesn't care. 
MARTIN: Well, Mel is _actually_ good at magic. What's going to happen to him? Maybe he'll have to turn a couple of guards into toads or something. 
RORY: All right. Time for the last two simple puzzles. Conveniently, they both involve the same location. Off to rob the bank. 
MARTIN: It's funnier if we do it in the other order. 
RORY: Hm. Good point. Okay, Puzzle 3: Two-Handed Bart.

> w
> n
> e

MARTIN: We're back in the bank lobby. 

> x poster
> x man

RORY: W.D. thinks the guy looks a little like Two-Handed Bart. 
MARTIN: He's _not_ Two-Handed Bart, but that's irrelevant. 
RORY: The poster describes Bart. He's got shiny hair, a handlebar mustache, and a green scarf. Our man has a hat on, a wispy mustache, and no scarf. So we need to fix that. 

> x scarf

MARTIN: Hm. It's yellow. Wrong color. 

> x dye
> dye scarf
> give scarf to man

RORY: Okay. One down. He's got the wrong kind of mustache, but we can fix this. 

> x mustache

MARTIN: ... W.D. may interrupt you here. 

> x mustache
> wind mustache
> wind mustache

RORY: You may have to wind it more or fewer times to get it into the right shape. You want the handlebar mustache.

> give mustache to man

MARTIN: We're nearly done, but we have to get rid of the hat. Disambiguation here - you can refer to his hat as "fedora" and skip the "do you 

mean the unhat or the hat or the fedora or the ordinary man" ridiculousness that you get sometimes. 

> take fedora

RORY: He won't let us take the hat. This is okay, though, because we have the essence of anti-hat. 

> put unhat on man

RORY: Okay, now we're good. We just have to summon the guard ...

> w
> pull cord

MARTIN: Now we need to collect the reward. 

> w 
> w 
> n
> show poster to guard

RORY: More treasure for us! And now we're in the right place to start robbing the bank. 

> x evidence 
> look in crack

MARTIN: You can see there are now more things in the evidence cabinet. Who knows where Two-Handed Bart has gone? 
RORY: All right. We need to blow open this cabinet. Where have we seen explosions before? 

> s
> e
> s
> get salt
> n
> w
> n

MARTIN: Darn you, Mendolyn! All right, we've gotten more salt from Sandie. 

> wave wand
> get faery
> put faery in crack
> put salt in crack

RORY: Now in some sense this is Failure #3, because the door stays on, but it alerts the guard, which is good enough. 

> z

MARTIN: Come on, man, wake up. 

> z 

RORY: Now we have one turn to grab things. 

> get scrap from cabinet

MARTIN: You can duplicate these steps and try to grab the device, but we're not going to do that here, because it doesn't actually work. The device is too bulky and the guard will notice you. There's another way to get the device, which we'll talk about in the next section. 
RORY: I dropped that thing on my claws at least twice. 
MARTIN: Hey, it was an authentically heavy prop. No cardboard boulders for us. 
RORY: Oy. Anyway, what the heck does this scrap even say? 

> x scrap

MARTIN: Hey, some bozo tried to rob the bank! 
RORY: Hey, look! A note! We don't need to speak People if we have a _note_!
MARTIN: Hey, Rory, do you like crime? 
RORY: Hell yeah, I like me some crime. Let's robbinate. 

> s
> e

MARTIN: Now, as you may recall from the previous puzzle, _there is an alarm system_. 

> break cord

RORY: But I'm awesome, so whatever. 

> e
> e 
> show scrap to teller

MARTIN: And now W.D. is the King of Moneyville. Good job. 

PART 4: THE HARD PUZZLES

RORY: Technically, you can win the game now; four puzzles is the minimum necessary. You can skip down to Part 5 if you want that. But now it's time for the good stuff. 
MARTIN: Puzzle 5: Robbing the Blind involves several parts and requires doing a timed event correctly. 
RORY: So we have this blind beggar in Big Street, South. He can't see you but he can hear you. So you need to make a really loud distraction so that you can steal the coin without him noticing. 
MARTIN: Now, there is a place in the game that's very loud. It's the one place in the game where "listen" does something special. 

> w 
> n
> listen

RORY: As W.D. says, the stock market is a zoo. Somewhat ... literally, I guess. These animals would be _really loud_ if we could get them to the beggar. 
MARTIN: We have a bunch of barely controlled animals, and we need to get them from Point A to Point Not A. We need to startle them, and then nature will take its course. 
RORY: Its chaotic, chaotic course. 
MARTIN: Right. Everybody loves a stampede. So we need a loud noise to startle the animals. 
RORY: Hey, wait, you're going to send them on the wrong track. You can't use the coin-and-salt trick here. The coin isn't actually loud. It's just bright. 
MARTIN: Ah, yes. You want less "explode" and more "pop". 
RORY: We're going for the balloon, if that's not clear. 
MARTIN: But you also shouldn't try to pop the balloon yourself. Standing in front of a stampede when it starts isn't very safe. (Feel free to try it and then "undo", if you like.) 
RORY: Now, you need someone _else_ to pop the balloon for you. 
MARTIN: Someone who might pop the balloon accidentally. 
RORY: Right. Someone kind of ... pointy.
MARTIN: DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN! 
RORY: ... 

> s
> w
> w
> sw
> ask hedgehog about stampede

MARTIN: Okay, asking the hedgehog about a stampede won't really work. You can't actually get a word in edgewise with the hedghog. 
RORY: I think you mean _hedgewise_, amirite amirite? 
MARTIN: Did you get an Irish coffee, by any chance? 
RORY: Hey, it was funny!

MARTIN: Reader, I know this is text, but I promise you I'm glaring at Rory. Anyhoo, no matter what you try to say to the hedgehog, he just 

obsessively asks for food and tells you how pointy he is. 

> hedgehog, go east

MARTIN: And you can't give him orders. 

> show balloon to hedgehog

RORY: But he _does_ like toys. 
MARTIN: We don't want to give him the balloon right away, because he'll be completely engrossed once he gets it. So let's go drop the balloon where we need it, and then come back. 

> nw
> e
> ne
> drop balloon
> sw
> w
> sw

RORY: All right. The hedgehog won't do anything we want. I guess we're forced to _listen_ to him. Let's feed him. 

> wave rod

RORY: You may recall that the fishing rod creates insects. Hedgehogs are insectivores, if you didn't know. You can also give him fish, but the fish are a pain to get. As soon as you wave the fishing rod, the hedghog will snarf the bait. 

> nw

RORY: And he'll follow you. You'll need to keep feeding him every few turns to keep him following you. 

> e
> wave rod
> ne

MARTIN: Now we've dragged the hedgehog to the stock market. He will start playing with the balloon. Now you need to book it to Big Street, South. The hedgehog will pop the balloon in a random but low number of turns. 

> sw
> s
> s

RORY: From here, wait until the stampede actually hits this location...

> z
> z
> z

MARTIN: You may need more or fewer than three turns.
RORY: Then grab the coin!

> get strange
> n

RORY: Yoink!
MARTIN: If you don't want to try to time your waiting, you can also just type "get strange" repeatedly and when it works, it works. 
RORY: The kid who plays the hedgehog was eight, in case you were wondering. So the screechy singing is authentic. 
MARTIN: He was a good kid. He was just really boisterous. 
RORY: And we'd like to point out that no actual animals were harmed in this. Just fake ones. We hear that our hedgehog actor went back to school and has been excitedly telling everyone that he got flattened by a cow in his first acting job.  

MARTIN: Now it's time for Puzzle 6: The Mysterious Device.
RORY: If this phrase means anything to you, this is Speculative Fiction's version of the Babelfish puzzle. 
MARTIN: The puzzle has a lot of steps and it's easy to break things at any step, so be prepared to restart it a lot.
RORY: You shouldn't have to undo or restore save games. But you might find it easier to "undo" than to run back to grab items again. 
MARTIN: First, let's grab the device. We know from an earlier puzzle that you can drop a faery coin and some salt into the crack in the evidence cabinet, and that will cause a guard to open the cabinet for a turn. But the device is big and bulky, and the guard will stop you from taking it. 
RORY: So we need to get the device "legitimately." We've been carrying around this vellum page which is some kind of requisition form for the device. 

> n
> w
> n
> show vellum to guard

MARTIN: The guard isn't impressed. And he tears up our form. That jerk! Frederick tried this trick a lot, though, so we'll just get another one. 

> look in wastebasket
> take vellum
> read vellum
> x signature

RORY: The major problem here is the signature. Even W.D. knows it's a bad forgery. Even the idiot downstairs knows it's a bad forgery. We gotta do better than this. Let's start over.

> x clear
> pour clear on signature

MARTIN: Now we have an unsigned sheet of paper, and a very sleepy civil servant with a stamp. 

> u
> put vellum on stack
> z
> take vellum
> read vellum

MARTIN: That's better. It's an official stamp! Who can disagree with an official stamp?

> d
> give vellum to guard

RORY: I feel like many problems in this world were caused by the city guards not caring. 
MARTIN: Nononoo. You're looking at it wrong. Many problems are _solved_ by the city guards not caring. Besides, there's that one guard from the ransom job. He knows it's not really Two-Handed Bart. 
RORY: Maybe Bill and him will team up in the sequel or something. 
MARTIN: Speculative Fiction 2: This Time It's Personal.
RORY: Yeah, so we have this device. 

> x device
> x tray
> push green button
> push blue button
> push red button

MARTIN: Oooh, oooh, maybe it's an instruction manual...

> take pamphlet
> read pamphlet

MARTIN: Er, well ... kind of. So the device needs:
   1.) Some wool
   2.) A bottle of blue dye, in the bottle
   3.) An unbroken egg
You put objects in the tray and press the blue button to load them. Then you press the green button to get money. 
RORY: Well, we have wool. 

> put wool on tray
> push blue button

MARTIN: And we have blue dye. 

> put blue dye on tray
> push blue button

RORY: Now we just need an egg! This puzzle is easy!
RORY AND MARTIN: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 

MARTIN: Okay, as you may recall, W.D. is basically a black hole when it comes to eggs. So we have to somehow get an egg into this machine without W.D. being able to eat it. 

RORY: Let's go back to the egg dispenser. 

> s
> sw
> s
> w

MARTIN: We already know he immediately eats the egg. Maybe we can put the egg into a container? 

> put vase in basket
> pull lever

MARTIN: Okay, the egg breaks, which isn't useful. However, you'll notice W.D. can't get the egg while it's inside the vase, which is useful. 
RORY: The machine won't accept a broken egg, so let's get rid of it. 

> break vase
> z
> z
> z
> z
> z
> take vase

RORY: The vase is magic. It reappears five turns after it disappears, so you can 
MARTIN: Maaaaaybe we can cushion it? 
RORY: What do we have that's soft? We just used up the blanket bit. 
MARTIN: And the whole blanket wouldn't fit anyway. Hey, you know what was soft? That scarf we gave to Two-Handed Bart. 
RORY: But Two-Handed Bart got disappeared! 
MARTIN: But his stuff ended up in the evidence locker. 
RORY: So ... back to the salt mines?
 
> e
> n
> e
> n
> n
> take salt
> n
> w
> n
> wave wand
> take faery
> put faery in crack
> put salt in crack
> z
> z
> get scarf

MARTIN: Phew. I'm tired just reading that. 
RORY: But we have the scarf!

> put scarf in vase

RORY: Note that the scarf is still sticking out a little. So if you are doing this puzzle before the ransom puzzle, you can get it back out. 
MARTIN: The vase is notable in that it's "very narrow". W.D. can't get his head in there. 
RORY: And once there's an egg in there, he'll be too blinded by its holy egginess to think of tipping the vase over. 
MARTIN: You're forgetting your own lines, Rory. W.D. tries to tip over the vase but the egg gets stuck. 
RORY: Grrr. I resent the implication that birds are this stupid.
MARTIN: Hey, I spend the whole game lying on a stone floor. 
RORY: What about the endgame? 
MARTIN: Okay, okay, two minutes of glory. ANYWAY...

> s
> sw
> s
> w

MARTIN: Back in the Pantry.

> put vase in basket
> pull lever

RORY: Now we have a vase with an egg in it, and W.D. can't get at the egg. 
MARTIN: But there's going to be a problem at the other end. We'll have to take the egg out of the vase and then W.D. will eat it. 
RORY: So we'll have to keep him from getting at the egg a different way. 
MARTIN: To get the egg initially, we had to put it into a container. To get rid of the egg, we'll have to put W.D. in a ... container.
RORY: Let's go back to the device. 

> take vase
> e
> n
> nw
> n
> take device
> s

MARTIN: The device is too heavy for W.D. to carry. But he can push it. 

> drop device
> push device s
> push device w

MARTIN: This has got to make an extremely strange sight for any passerby. "Hm, there's a bird pushing a metal box and frantically trying to stick its head in a vase." 
RORY: I really hope I get cast in a dramatic role someday. 

> take scarf

MARTIN: We'll need to remove the scarf from the vase or else the device will reject the egg. 

> put vase on tray
> get device
> enter circle
> drop device

RORY: We'll also need to remove the vase from the egg. W.D. is ::grumble:: apparently too "bird-brained" to think of this one himself. 
MARTIN: Note the timing here. You have to take the fish the turn before you free the egg, or else W.D. will have time to eat it. 

> take fish
> break vase

MARTIN: Sproing! Now W.D. can't reach the egg, 'cause he's in the cage. 

> push blue button

RORY: Of course, W.D. also can't reach the button that will get rid of the egg...
MARTIN: Ha ha, but Frederick the wizard, tool-using mammal, will save the day!

> push blue button with wand

RORY: Now the egg's gone and you can get W.D. out of the cage.

> break cage
> break cage
> break cage

MARTIN: At some point, the vase will reform itself. Surprise. It's magic. 

> push green button
> take counterfeit
> exit circle

RORY: Regardless of what the machine says, Mel will accept this money. 
MARTIN: In theory we could go get another egg and another bottle of dye, but the blanket represents the only wool in the entire kingdom, so we're done here. 
RORY: We're ready for the last of the pre-endgame puzzles. Puzzle 7: Playing the Stock Market.
MARTIN: This is a two-stage puzzle. In the first stage, you'll need to crack the mystery of the merchants and successfully buy a stock. In the second stage, you'll need to artificially inflate the price of the stock you just bought. 
RORY: It's now finally time to deal with the merchants. 

> e
> e
> ne

MARTIN: The merchants are immune to stampedes, by the way. A wizard did it. 
RORY: But not you. You're incompetent. 
MARTIN: Mel probably did it. 
RORY: If you haven't already examined the merchants...

> x merchants

RORY: ... will cause W.D. to assign them names. You'll need to be able to disambiguate them. 
MARTIN: Here we have eight merchants, and an auctioneer selling stock in various animals. If you wait for enough turns, you'll see that different stocks sell for different amounts of money. Every bid doubles the price of a stock. Bidding starts at one florin. You have one florin. 
RORY: Each merchant cares about a different attribute. You'll need to figure out what each merchant likes and dislikes, and then pick a stock which no merchant wants. You'll be able to buy that stock for a single florin. 
MARTIN: The auctioneer randomly selects animals, but will never select the animal that's the puzzle solution. You can, however, suggest stocks to him with "search coffer for <animal>". 

> search coffer for dog

RORY: You may have to enter this command a couple of times; the auctioneer only takes suggestions right as one auction is ending. "dog" isn't the answer, by the way; it's just an example.
MARTIN: You can bid via "buy certificate with florin", but any other merchant can outbid you. 

> buy certificate with florin

RORY: If you examine the individual merchants, you can get a vague hint as to what they like. 

> x rupertina
> x sunshine
> x fnyrx
> x elspeth
> x percival
> x demonspoon
> x rombert
> x hortensia

RORY: Also as another hint, two of the merchants care about the attributes of the animals themselves. The other six care about attributes of the _names_ of the animals. 
MARTIN: So this is mostly a word puzzle. 
RORY: For the record, we didn't know about any of this ourselves. The writers gave us a list.
MARTIN: There are some _hilarious_ outtakes of the merchants trying to remember their lines. 
RORY: "One!" "Four!" "Six! No, wait, three! Wait, do I even like cows?" 
MARTIN: The crew laughed for a good five minutes. 

ALESSANDRA: What's up, home fries? 
RORY: Alessandra?! You came! 
MARTIN: I thought you were filming!
ALESSANDRA: We had to wrap early. Fatal bug - turned out you could "take" the dragon. 
MARTIN: Ooooh. Classic blunder. 
RORY: Hey, now that you're hee, want to read the merchant list? 
ALESSANDRA: Uh, sure. Lessee...
   One only likes land animals (including amphibians)
   One only likes animals with legs
   One only likes animals who don't have any doubled letters in their names
   One only likes animals with five or fewer letters in their names
   One only likes animals with nine or greater letters in their names
   One only likes animals with an even number of letters in their names
   One only likes animals whose names cannot be beheaded to form a new word. "So crow is bad because if you take off the c you get row, but dog is good because if you take off the d you don't get a word." 
   One only likes animals whose names cannot have their third letter changed to form a new word. "So dog is bad because you can change the g and get dot, but snake is good because snike or snoke or whatever aren't words." 

   ... What? 

RORY: Thanks, Alessandra. 
ALESSANDRA: Was this from the stock puzzle? I didn't really see it because I spent the whole time in Big Street, Center. 
MARTIN: Yeah. I didn't really see it either. I just heard about it later. 
RORY: We should give them the actual answer. 
MARTIN: Right. Alessandra? 
ALESSANDRA: Okay, wait, I lost my place ... Ah. You know from the two lengths that you want an animal whose name is between six and eight letters. From the even merchant, you know you want a seven letter name. From the land animal and leg animal merchants, you know you want a sea creature. You also know it must have a doubled letter, that it must form a new word if you change the third letter, and that the last six letters must spell a word. The answer is herring. 
MARTIN: Okay, knowing all that, you still have to enter the right commands: 

> search coffer for herring
> give florin to auctioneer
> z

RORY: I think we may have said this before, but you can only suggest a stock right as one auction is ending, so you might have to time the 
"search coffer for herring" command right. Nothing bad happens if you try it at the wrong time; it just doesn't work. 
MARTIN: Ta-da! Now you've done part one of the puzzle. 
ALESSANDRA: That was part ONE?
MARTIN: Well, in some sense that was part 2. Part 1 was getting the florin, although that isn't too hard. 
ALESSANDRA: Clearly I missed a lot by staying in the meats stall. 
RORY: Once you've bought your share of Consolidated Herring Securities, the merchants go off to have coffee and the auctioneer sets up a stock ticker. Now you get to play with another mysterious device. 
MARTIN: Right. The stock certificate you have now isn't worth anything. You'll have to hack the ticker to convince the auctioneer that it's 

valuable, and then sell it back to him. 
 
> x ticker
> push red button
> push yellow button
> z 

RORY: Pushing the red button spits out some mysterious text, and pushing the yellow button causes the stock ticker to start displaying stock 

values. If you wait a few turns, you'll see it rotates through the same five stocks. 

> x panel
> open panel  

MARTIN: Inside the device you'll find six colored wires and six places you can plug those wires in. 
ALESSANDRA: I'm getting a headache. Goodnight, guys. 
RORY: Aw. 
MARTIN: Any time, Alessandra. 
RORY: Again, aw. All right. Let's finish this puzzle. 

> disconnect black wossname
> z

RORY: You can see the stock ticker's display has changed. If you push the red button again: 

> push red button

RORY: You can see that's changed too. 
MARTIN: The wires somehow connect the incoming stock data to the external display. 
RORY: Where the "incoming stock data" is coming in through magic or something. 

> disconnect brown wossname
> connect black wossname to brown receptacle
> connect brown wossname to black receptacle
> push red button

MARTIN: You can see the ordering of the alphabet has changed. So now the input data's been warped and the ticker's displaying a different set of stocks. 
RORY: According to the notes which the writers gave us, the device is using a six bit input - each of the letters and numbers corresponds to a six-bit number. By swapping the wires around, you change what letters and numbers the device displays. 
MARTIN: You can keep changing wires and checking the red button until you get the alphabet in an order you like. But here's the answer:

> connect yellow wossname to orange receptacle

> connect red wossname to brown receptacle

MARTIN: You can leave the green wossname - er, wire - in place. 
RORY: At this point the ticker will tell you that CHS (Consolidated Herring Securities) is up 37, um, units. 

> give certificate to auctioneer

MARTIN: And ... that's the seven main-game puzzles. 
RORY: LET'S TAKE THIS TRAIN TO THE ENDGAME.

PART 5: THE ENDGAME

RORY: Okay, so there's one and a half endgames. First we have to give all the ingredients to Mel and go make the potion. This part is not timed. 

> sw
> s
> e

RORY: Back to Mel's. 

> give sovereign to mel
> give sack to mel

MARTIN: Once you give Mel four treasures, which will be now if you're following the walkthrough, Mel will unlock a secret trapdoor in the floor. This will let you go down to the "sekkrit laboratory" and make the potion. 
RORY: Mel unlocks the trapdoor at four treasures because that's the minimum you need to make a potion which won't get you killed. So you can stop at four or keep going for more points. 
MARTIN: We, of course, want more points. 

> give banknote to mel 
> give reward money to mel
> give strange coin to mel

MARTIN: Make sure to check the recipes before you start buying things. 

> buy all ingredients

RORY: If you haven't solved all seven potions, you can do "buy <ingredient>" with a specific name. The page you got from the alchemy bench will give you the list of options. Or "buy ingredient" will _also_ give you the list of options. 
MARTIN: Now we'll save our game and go downstairs. I'm specifically suggesting saving now because you can get different endings depending on which potion you make. 

> save
> whatever pick a save name
> d

RORY: And now we're in the secret laboratory.

> x sign

RORY: Did we mention to save your game? 

> x pot
> x liquid

MARTIN: Here we have the potion-o-matic. Now. Do NOT add anything to the pot that is not part of one of the potion recipes. You won't get it back and you'll ruin any potion you have in progress.

> put kidney in pot
> put whiskey in pot
> put starmetal in pot
> put ash in pot
> put blood in pot
> put runestone in pot
> put fur in pot

MARTIN: Alternatively, use "put all ingredients in pot". 
RORY: Nearly there...

> press sigil
> i

MARTIN: There's a potion! W.D. will tell you to go back to your body. Well, W.D. will tell you to tell him to take him and your mind back to your body. 

> u
> w
> s
> s
> u

RORY: Oh no! NOT ANOTHER CUT SCENE!
MARTIN: And now we're at the "real" endgame. This part is timed. You'll only need three turns to finish, though.
RORY: Now, if you don't have a valid potion, you are going to die. I hope you saved when we told you to. 
MARTIN: We start at the bottom of the tower. The treasurer will take a few turns to get the lift started. W.D. can just fly up. 

> u
> n

RORY: Everything in the vault is a mess. 

> x logs

MARTIN: These are the logs which Frederick the wizard put here so that the Perfectly Foolproof Illusion could have some objects to work on. 
RORY: Now, you have two options. One, you could: 

> pour potion on logs

RORY: ... and watch that ending. Or, you could "z" until W.D. says "Uh oh. They're here." Then...

> pour potion on treasurer

MARTIN: Obviously, the latter option only works if you have the full Midas potion. 
RORY: You'll get a winning ending with "pour potion on logs" for any potion that required at least four ingredients. 

PART 6: CRAZY ACTIONS YOU SHOULD DO SO SOMEONE SEES ALL OF THIS TEXT DEAR GOD WE INTENDED FOR THIS GAME TO BE SHORT

MARTIN: Once you've won, you should check "AMUSING" for some random fun things you can do in the game. 

RORY: My personal recommendation is that you put the costuming parts on "Two-Handed Bart" one at a time and pull the cord after each one. You can't actually make that puzzle unwinnable, so the guards get more and more ridiculous as you summon them over and over. 
MARTIN: I also like trying to go back to the barn after you've burned it down. 
RORY: Try having W.D. drink the potion as soon as you make it. 
MARTIN: Oh, that's a good one. He'll run through all the puzzles you've solved, complaining about each one. 
RORY: Try popping the balloon in the stock market if you want to watch me die. ::sniff:: You're not that cruel, right? Also, if you wait while the hedgehog plays with the balloon, you can see him try to befriend it.
MARTIN: Oh, oh! Goofy endings. I think the five-ingredient potion is pretty exciting. 
RORY: SO MANY EXTRAS. 
MARTIN: Yeah, that was exciting to film. Also, if you do have the full Midas potion, you could try pouring it on the other people in the room. 
RORY: I find the "pour potion on guard" ending pretty funny for W.D. 
MARTIN: You can also get killed by going to the endgame and just waiting until the treasurer has you executed. That ending kills Frederick but not W.D. Or you can do "pour potion on wizard" if you hate us. 
RORY: I guess in some sense that's the ending we deserve for all the havoc we wreak, but come on man, it's funny!
MARTIN: Hm, random things to try. Oh, if you break the alarm cord and then wait around, a workman comes and repairs it. That's actually a cameo by our Executive Producer. 
RORY: Oh, and W.D.'s girlfriend does not actually appear in the game, if you're wondering. 
MARTIN: Well, I've finished my coffee (thanks again, Rory!) and you've finished the game, so I think that's time to call it a day. 
RORY: Yeah! Thanks again for playing! We hope to see you in another game!
Supernova Walkthrough  (Apogee Software)
By Ramon Bartschat (bartschat@goldnet.sk)

I will only describe the shortest way. 
And I will omit many details. There are many more rooms and objects you should explore on your own.

In between the described steps you will have to eat, drink and sleep.
-Sleeping can be done in your hotel room bed or spaceship bed.
-You can drink your beer and then refill the mug at a water tap at either your room or your spaceships bathroom. You can also drink directly from the water tap.
-You can only eat the food from the old storehouse; careful it is for a limited amount of times.

START
- Buy a beer, sit at the middle table, wait for the aliens to sit down and then "listen carefully" to all they have to say, write down the coordinates they mention.
(Notice that the holster in your room is of no use in the game, also the rusty key is only needed to open your hotel room, nothing else)
- Go outside to the old storehouse and get the satchel with food (you don't need the satchel, just the food)


(SPECIAL CHEAT
- Go W on the Dusty Road until you "notice something unusual" then type ENTER or IN
This will take you directly to the ice planet with all the items you need and you will not be hungry, thirsty or sleepy)


WITHOUT CHEAT
- Go to your spaceship
- Go to the cockpit, place the cushion on the seat and sit down.
- To make it past security you have to provide the same "identity code name" you defined at beginning the game
- Fly to the coordinates you overheard from the aliens in the bar (R2/20-8-23 D2/VEGA)
- Initiate the countdown and rush for your cryo tube
- Keep trying to land (pushing the button) until you do so.
- Get out of your spaceship and head for the pyramid. Careful to "jump stream" to avoid the acid stream.
- When you get stung by the animal return to your spaceships laboratory and get serum number 6 (Poisons/Venoms). Put the empty mug in the niche for the serum. The serum dispenser will work only 2 times but you will not need it any more, only this one time.
- Get the cushion you will need it in the pyramid
- Return now all the way to the pyramid.
- Open the mouth of the dog, take the jewel and open the pyramid door with it.
- Get down to the skeleton room; get the grey disk (you don't need the skull)
- Go to the mini-pyramid room; touch the pyramid to open the secret passage. 
- Enter the secret room and get the dusty ball, clean the ball, throw the ball at the wall to extract the shiny key (Should the secret door close then "turn podium" to open it again or just leave the room before it closes)
- Go to the mirror room. In the mirror room go NW-S-SE-E-NE-W-SE and then DOWN. (You might have to try several times until you don't bump into a wall any more)
- Drop all you have except the cushion and the shiny key (You will need to carry a heavy rod later)
- Head for the other mini-pyramid room
- Put the cushion on the floor, put the shiny key in the keyhole, catch the crystal (wait a little for a secret room to open)
- Get back to the round room and take the rod
- CRAWL NORTH, JUMP GAP, PUT ROD IN RECESS
- Go and take all the items you left before. 
- Go back through the mirror room NW-E-SE-S-NW-SE and UP  (again you might have to try several times to go in a certain direction until you don't bump into a wall)
- Go back to where the big climbable tree is. A new way heading SW will be available now.
- Follow the SW track and enter the Antenna Building  (From now on, when you find things to read, read them backwards - SDRAWKCAB)
- Go to the transport booth and push the button
- Go find the robot in the Reactor Control room, "open panel" and get the plastic card
- Open the closed door with the plastic card, enter and get the suit
- Go to the transport boot and push the purple button to get the goggles, push the cyan button to go to the ice planet. Use the tan button to get back to the planet with your spaceship (to refill water or to sleep for example)


ON THE ICE PLANET (in reality a giant planet size spaceship)
- Enter the building and put the grey disk in the slot
- DROP ALL! If not you will loose all when the robot comes. You will find the grey disk here again, you don't need it.
- Wait for the robot to zap you and then get all your possessions again.
- Wear the suit and go out to the circular corridor
- Go to the Transmission room and turn off the alarm (this is not a necessary step though)
- Go to the Maintenance room, find and get the gloves (you don't need the "device" found there)
- Go to the closed door -the one with the picture of a cryogenic tube- and open it with the plastic card
- Enter to the Emergency Override room and Hit the cryo tube with the mug to free the scientist
- Either wait for the scientist here or follow him (you will end up in the same room again anyhow; following him gives you a clue where to check which crystal is damaged)
- Give him the clear crystal
- Wait to hear all his instructions
- Head for the elevator and go to the level the scientist mentioned you (480)
- Now is the time to wear the goggles (to cross the catwalk) and the gloves (to touch the crystals)
- Exit the elevator and head for the Reactor Regulator room where the panel with the crystals is 
- The robot in Security Tunnel Number 3 will shoot you, you cannot avoid it.
- Open the panel and get the blue crystal
- Place your clear crystal in the socket


That is about it.
Remember, there are many more rooms and objects you should investigate.

WALKTHROUGH FOR VACATION GONE AWRY
                ------------------

_Vacation Gone Awry_, by Johan Berntsson, Fredrik Ramsberg, and
Staffan Friberg is available at:

http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/Vacation.z5

(you may have to watch for line breaks in that URL)

Note:  _Vacation Gone Awry_ has in-game hints.  Before resorting
to the walkthrough, you may want to get as far in the game as
possible, using those hints.

This file is a little discursive, including some actions which are
not necessary to complete the game.  However, they should make the
experience more enjoyable.  The exact phrases you will need to type
into the interpreter are in ALL CAPS.

This walkthrough is based on Release 2 / Serial number 020130 / Inform
v6.15 Library 6/2

THE CABIN
---------

You're on vacation in Germany, with your wife and daughters.  And (to
quote the game) "as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you
find that your family is gone..."

You begin in the bedroom.  If you examine all the furniture (X BED, LOOK
UNDER BED, LOOK AT TABLE, etc.), you will find out more about what kind
of people you and your family are.  But the only thing you really need to
do here is OPEN CLOSET, and then SEARCH CLOTHES (GET CLOTHES will also
work).

(On the second turn you will hear something passing overhead.  Remember
this!)

SW will take you to the living room.  Again, looking at all the things
mentioned in the room description will add to your knowledge of your family
(X RUG, X FIREPLACE, X SOFA, LOOK UNDER SOFA).  (If you've played Zork, try
typing MOVE RUG.)  Play around with things, and make sure to X TABLE.  You'll
see a tiny piece of paper.  X PAPER (READ PAPER would also work).

Aha, so that's where they are.  And you now have a tentative mission: drive
to town to go shopping.

You can go NW to the kitchen if you like; X TILES is kind of intriguing, and
you could GET GAME and PLAY GAME for a while.  But it doesn't really get you
anywhere.

(Hmmm... where do these people go to the bathroom?  I guess it isn't
important.  :)

From the living room, S takes you outside--it's cold, so you should WEAR
SWEATER.  You could walk S to the road and try walking S again--okay, you'll
need the car.  Go back N to the driveway.

You'll be gone for a while; better CLOSE FRONT DOOR.  ENTER CAR, CLOSE CAR
DOOR, and TURN ON THE CAR.  Ick, the stereo!  (Try LISTEN TO STEREO for a
good time... not.)

DRIVE SOUTH (or just S would work) twice and --

Uh-oh.  (So *that's* what passed overhead on the second turn of the game.)
Here it's important to notice: the sphere is beta radiant (dangerous to
expose yourself to it for long periods of time); it will kill everyone
in the vicinity (including you and your unwitting family); you have to
go get the sphere from the center and bring it back here to the aliens.

Your car is off now, so TURN ON ENGINE, and you can see that a smaller
road leads WEST, so follow it.

OUT gets you out of the car (automatically turning off the engine).  

CABLE CAR TERMINAL AREA
-----------------------

You may want to explore a bit: NORTH then DOWN takes you to an iron
door, which you can't open (at least not yet... but it's good to know
that it's there).  UP then SOUTH takes you back to the parking lot.

(SOUTHWEST takes you to a garage, but you don't need to go here.  It
just gives you another option for the next puzzle.  From the garage,
EAST goes back to the parking area.)

From there NORTHWEST and WEST gets to the actual Cable Car Terminal.

You'll see a trunk; OPEN it, GET all the contents (the bag and wrench).
Then CLOSE TRUNK.  (I don't know if it's necessary, but listen:
someone's hanging around and whistling, and you don't want them to know
you're here.)

You want to get across the wire.  There are three ways (at least) to do
it.  I did it the hard way, so here's that one:

Your goal is to get the guy who's whistling to ferry you over.  To do
that, you'll need to hide on the roof of the car.  But once he comes into
the room, you'll have to already be hidden.  So prepare the car:

ENTER CAR. UP. OPEN HATCH. DOWN. EXIT.

Now you can lure the guy out:

KNOCK ON DOOR. ENTER CAR. U. U.

WAIT twice and you'll see the service man come out of his door.  He
looks around for you and can't find you (I wonder why?).  He decides
to leave anyway.  WAIT three more times and you will be at...

THE CENTER
----------

or more specifically at the Upper Cable Car Terminal.

If you try to get on the floor, there's no way to avoid being seen.
Instead STAND ON WIRE and WAIT five times for the man to leave with
the car.

Don't be afraid: type DOWN and you will land safely every time.

Pursuing your goal to pick up everything that isn't nailed down (a
usual strategy for adventure games), you'll want to OPEN CHEST, GET
everything from it (chain and cutters), and CLOSE CHEST.  Again, it's
probably not necessary to close it, but I worry that someone will
discover your theft if you leave it open.  Anyway, that's everything
to do in this room, so go NORTH and face the receptionist.

When she asks if you speak english, type WOMAN, YES to answer her.

Then she asks for your name.  Fortunately she's willing to wait a while.
To figure out who you are (or who you want to pretend to be), try
examining everything in sight.  Specifically, X BOX (or X DESK gives
you the same description).  Hey, there's a tag in there, maybe it's for
you.  X TAG.  Then tell the woman what she wants to hear:  WOMAN, HANS
LEIBACH.

You will get that name tag (which you should wear throughout the center),
and the head of the center, Williams, shows up, and says to come see him.
But you don't want to do that yet; there's a puzzle in his office you
can't solve yet, until you've explored a little.  While you're here,
X LIST to tell you everyone's names, and ASK HENKEL (the receptionist)
about all of them.  She gives you especially useful information about John
and Stefan (namely, that Stefan is gone and you're replacing him, and that
John drinks).  Try ASK HENKEL ABOUT SPHERE to find out exactly which room
the thing is in.

Before entering the center itself, you may want to begin making a map.
This walkthrough will tell you how to get from place to place, but exploring
on your own can be fun too.

Go NORTH into the center.  To get the objects you'll need for the puzzle
in Williams' office, go WEST three times (into the kitchen).  You'll need
pretty much everything here.  GET KETTLE.  Then you'll have to hunt around
in the drawers and fridge.  OPEN UPPER DRAWER. GET GLASS.  OPEN LOWER
DRAWER.  GET KNIFE AND BOTTLE.  OPEN FRIDGE.  GET MEAT.  (X STOVE and
X WALLPAPER will get amusing messages, though it isn't really necessary.
Other messages include X MICROWAVE and USE MICROWAVE (a reference to
Lurking Horror in that one).)

(SOUTH and X CHAIRS gets you another amusing message.  I didn't find
anything else to do in the dining room.  NORTH gets you back to the kitchen.)

While you're in the neighborhood, let's get some more items that will
come in handy.  Go EAST twice from the kitchen, then SOUTH into the bathroom.
GET SOAP.  See that fusevault?  Although it is "high up on the eastern wall",
you can OPEN it.  Then GET CANDLE AND LIGHTER.  CLOSE FUSEVAULT (you may have
noticed by now that I have a "thing" about closing doors).

GETTING STEFAN'S CODE
---------------------

Since this is a walkthrough, we're going to do things in a slightly
different order than if you were just playing straight through.  You
already know (because you talked with Henkel) that Stefan is gone, so
his office is empty.  There's a useful item in there.  To get there,
head NORTH from the bathroom, EAST three times and then NORTH two more
times.  You'll be outside his office.

Try going EAST--the door is locked.  X DOOR.  You can see the bolt in
the chink...  If there were just some way to lift the bolt.  Well, there
is.  PUT KNIFE IN CHINK.  OPEN DOOR and GO EAST.

First things first: X everything you can see.  X CHAIR doesn't give you
much that's interesting.  X COMPUTER won't help; if you try to login, it
tells you to talk with Ms. Henkel about it; and if you ASK HENKEL ABOUT
LOGIN at some point, she tells you she hasn't had time to set yours up.
But it *is* possible to log into the computer, if you know some passwords
from other games.  Meanwhile, X DESK and X BASKET.  Aha, something's there.
GET PAPER and READ IT.  You may want to write down the code that's there.
It changes every game, so be sure to keep track of your saved games.  Soon
we'll find out what the code is used for.  

Right now, in fact.  Let's go check out Schwartz.  If you asked Henkel
about him, you didn't find out much; in fact, he's the head of security
for the center.  To get to his office, go WEST once, SOUTH twice, WEST
once, and SOUTH into the office.

For a security officer, Schwartz is remarkably unparanoid.  Just
X everything in his office with him sitting there, and he doesn't even
care.  Especially X DESK and X LIST.  Then, you can even GET LIST right
from under his nose.  The list tells you that there are four codes, and
that everyone in the center has one.  Except you.  ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT
CODE.  He just tells you to talk to Henkel, and we already know where
*that* got us.

ASK SCHWARTZ ABOUT SPHERE, although he isn't very helpful.  But you can
see where it is: X VIDEO MONITOR.  Naturally, the one place you want to
be is the one place he's watching every second of the day.  X RECORDER
and try to play with the buttons--nope, not while he's here.  At least
he prevents you from doing *something* in his office.

GETTING JOHN'S CODE
-------------------

We've done enough here.  Finally we can go talk to Dr. Williams.  Go
NORTH once and EAST twice to his office.

If you WAIT a turn, he tells you that he wants to propose a toast, but
has no glass for you to drink out of.  GIVE GLASS TO WILLIAMS.  (You
don't actually need to wait a turn; if you don't, you really confuse
the heck out of Williams--he probably thinks you're psychic or something.)  

Then Williams starts looking around in his desk.  WAIT twice, and he'll
leave to get your forms.  Now you must spring into action--your goal is
to get *all* of his whisky.  Fortunately you brought a bunch of
containers with you.  Furthermore, you don't want him to know that
you've stolen the whisky, so you have to fool him somehow.

To be specific, you'll need to leave the brown bottle full of tea when
you walk out of here.  So GET KETTLE.  GET BROWN BOTTLE.  GET GREEN
BOTTLE. (so you don't have any awkward moments where the parser tells
you "You're not holding that")  POUR WHISKY INTO GREEN BOTTLE.  POUR
TEA INTO BROWN BOTTLE.  PUT BROWN BOTTLE ON DESK.  Finally, PUT ALL
IN BAG (so Williams won't realize what you've done).  Then you just
have to WAIT (four times) and Williams will return, you'll sign the
paper, and then you can GET GLASS and go WEST to leave.  (I'm not sure
you need the glass for anything, but it's just good practice to pick up
anything you can.)

You may as well READ DOCUMENT too; it tells you three things.

1) Schwartz is the security guy (but you knew that anyway)

2) The castle area is off-limits (not that you'll pay any attention
   to that, will you?) and

3) You need all four codes to get into the security lab.

Well, all that whisky has to come in useful somehow, so let's go get
John to talk to us.  The people wander around randomly, so you have
to go find John wherever he is.  I usually wait for him in the library
or in his office.  Once you and he are in the same room, GIVE GREEN BOTTLE
TO JOHN.

He drags you to his office and gets very drunk.  Now is your chance:
ASK JOHN ABOUT CODE.  Again, remember the number--write it down
somewhere, since it changes every game.

GETTING WILLIAMS' CODE (with some unrelated activity)
-----------------------------------------------------

So now what?  Well, since this is a walkthrough, I know that you need
something in the basement.  To get there, leave John's office by going
WEST, go NORTH twice, WEST twice, SOUTH twice, and WEST once again.

You want to go through the door to the south, but you can't because it's
locked.  Go ahead, X DOOR--notice the "door closer"?  X CLOSER.  Try OPEN
DOOR (no good).  You'll just have to wait for someone else to go through.
In particular wait for a message like "Petra puts a key in the lock...
and walks south" (when I play, it always seems to be Petra), then X DOOR
again (notice the description of the bolt... any ideas?).

If you block the bolt, the door can't lock.  So PUT SOAP IN BOLT.  Some
of it is sticking out--that won't work, Petra will notice.  CUT SOAP.
Now wait for Petra to leave.  Then go SOUTH and GET PADLOCK.  You can
X EQUIPMENT, but it isn't important.

Now we're going to head outside.  To get there, go NORTH out of the
storage room, then EAST, NORTH twice, EAST, and NORTH twice again.
You will be in the yard.

Keep going: NORTH, WEST, NORTH into the toolshed.  Only two things to
look at here: X BENCH (although it's rather pointless) and X SCOOTER
(notice the hook).  You need the scooter, and you need it someplace
else.  TURN ON SCOOTER and ENTER IT.  Then go SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH,
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHEAST and GET OFF SCOOTER and TURN IT OFF.  You'll
need to go inside the poultry house mentioned here by going NORTHWEST
and EAST.

Here the interesting object is the grating.  X GRATING, then go ahead
and try OPEN GRATING.  You'll need some leverage here.  Specifically,
TIE CHAIN TO GRATING--this wouldn't have worked without the padlock.
Then GET CHAIN and PUT CHAIN IN WINDOW (you don't even have to open
the window--it's broken).  Back to the scooter by going WEST and SOUTHEAST.

This tripped me up a bunch of times: you have to ATTACH CHAIN TO HOOK.
(Do not just type "put chain on hook", because that doesn't work,
although it sounded to me as though it did.  Anyway, use the "attach"
syntax, and you'll be fine.)  Then PUSH SCOOTER.

Let's go see what you've wrought: NORTHWEST and EAST to get inside
the poultry house, then DOWN into the hole and SOUTH.

X DOOR (it should look familiar from way back at the beginning of
the game) and X HANDLE.  You can try TURN HANDLE, but it won't do
you any good.  You don't have what you need, yet.

That's our next task.  NORTH, UP, WEST, and NORTHWEST takes you to
the center of the yard.  Continue NORTH, EAST, NORTHEAST, and
NORTH... we're getting close to the castle that you were warned
against!  READ SIGN to remind you of that very thing.  Well, tough.
Go on to the NORTH.  (X CASTLE if you want.)

You have two choices.  To begin with, go NORTHWEST.  There's a
useful item: a ladder.  GET LADDER.  Now go back to the SOUTHEAST
and try the other passage to the NORTHEAST.

Ignore the western door for now and go NORTH to the bottom of the
staircase.  (X STAIRCASE if you like.)  Go on UP to the top of the
staircase and follow the exit SOUTHWEST (X HOLES for a little
atmosphere), then WEST.

This room is a bit complicated.  You'll want to X everything in
sight again.  X SHELVES and X CUPBOARD.  Hmm... you can see all the
shelves except one.  Guess what you need to do?

PUT LADDER AGAINST SHELVES.  CLIMB LADDER.  Hey--X IRON KETTLE
(you'll have to keep calling it "iron kettle" to distinguish it
from the clay kettle, unless you drop the clay kettle somewhere).
GET that KETTLE.  Then you can go DOWN off the ladder.

Now it's time to deal with the cupboard.  Play around a bit before
you read the next part--in particular, play around until you die
a few times!

OPEN CUPBOARD.  Hey, X those UNIFORMS.  (Try to GET UNIFORMS for
an amusing message.)  Well, even though the uniforms are in there,
there's still room for you, so ENTER CUPBOARD.  Now X CUPBOARD
again.  The message is a bit different inside here.  Keep on
examining stuff.  X WALL tells you about a crack, and X CRACK tells
you about a metal plate.  X DOOR also tells you a little about the
plate.  You can open the rear wall, but I wouldn't do that yet.
(Okay, you can try it, but save your game first.)  So how could you
do that safely?  All that stuff about the plates means that only
one door can be open at a time: either the door you came through,
or the rear wall.  So first you must CLOSE DOOR, then you can
OPEN REAR WALL.  Go on out to the NORTH.

Uh-oh, a bomb!  First things first: X BOMB.  Looks like the bomb
won't go off on its own, so you have time to go ahead and X CORD,
X WIRE, and X STRAP too.  Fortunately, way back near the
beginning of the game, you picked up some wire cutters.  So CUT
RED WIRE WITH CUTTERS, and then CUT CORD WITH CUTTERS.  Yes, the
order is important.

Now that that's done, X CUPBOARD once again.  It looks different
from this angle--X PROTRUSION for a little more info, and then
X BAR for still more detail.  Might as well try to GET BAR.  It
doesn't work, but you can GET BAR again and it *does* work this
time.

That's all you need on this side of the cupboard, so SOUTH goes
back inside, OPEN DOOR (since you disabled the bomb, you can do
this without fear), SOUTH to get out of the cupboard, and don't
forget to GET LADDER before you leave.

Remember that doorway to the west that we ignored?  Let's go back
there.  EAST, NORTHEAST, DOWN, then SOUTH.  Now we can go through
that doorway to the WEST.

Interesting.  X HOLE, LOOK IN HOLE, and try going DOWN.  No good.
Fortunately, you brought a helpful item.  PUT LADDER IN HOLE.  Try
going DOWN now--*still* no good.  It's true you'll need the kettle
later, but you can leave it here for now: DROP IRON KETTLE.  Then try
DOWN (the third time's the charm).  

It's pretty clear the only way to go from here: WEST, and then NORTH.
You can X FIREPLACE and X CHIMNEY, and then go on EAST.  Here you could
X WOOD, X SHAFT, and X BASKET.  Something about this shaft reminds me
of other games I've played--you can bet you'll be using it before
you're through.  For the moment, GET WOOD and go back WEST.  PUT THE
WOOD IN THE FIREPLACE.

The game told you earlier that something was blocking the chimney.
Let's go find out what it is.  If you try to ENTER THE FIREPLACE,
you're told that you can't do it with the metal bar, so DROP BAR
and then ENTER FIREPLACE.  If you LOOK, you will see bird
droppings... Go on UP.

Aha, the source of the droppings.  X NEST and X KEY.  Go ahead and
GET KEY.  That's all you have to do here, so go DOWN and OUT.

You may have noticed a mention in passing about the soot, while you
were climbing.  X ME to see the effects of the soot.  This wouldn't
seem like a problem, but if you go back to the center this way, they'll
know where you've been, and remember: the castle is forbidden, so
you'll get in trouble.  You've got to remove the soot first.  (For
an amusing message, save the game and go back the way you are.)
There are apparently at least two different ways to clean yourself.

What we have to do is melt some snow, and use that to wash off the
soot.  What to use for a container?  The iron kettle would be nice...
We could melt it over the fire...  But we can't bring it down the
ladder normally.  There's another way to get it down, though.

First, let's go get the kettle.  Go SOUTH, EAST, and UP to where you
left it, and GET IRON KETTLE.  Now to get it downstairs.  Go EAST,
SOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, and NORTH.

You haven't been in here before.  You can X FIREPLACE and X SHAFT.
I bet you know where the other end of that shaft it.  TURN WHEEL.

Oops, you need some snow in the kettle before you get it downstairs.
Go SOUTH; the snow has been blowing around a lot, or else there's a
hole in the ceiling, because there's some snow here.  So FILL IRON
KETTLE WITH SNOW.  Then go back NORTH.  PUT IRON KETTLE IN BASKET.
You can see you aren't the first one to think of this.  TURN WHEEL
to send it back downstairs.

So let's follow it.  Go SOUTH, SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, WEST, DOWN,
WEST, NORTH, and finally EAST.  Whew!

To turn the snow into water, GET IRON KETTLE and take it to the
WEST.  PUT IRON KETTLE ON WOOD and make a fire: LIGHT WOOD WITH
LIGHTER.  You'll have to wait about ten turns until the wood is
consumed by the fire and you get the message "The kettle is not as
hot anymore".  Then the water will be bearable.  GET IRON KETTLE
once more and WASH ME.  (You don't have to specify "with water" or
anything like that.)  X ME to verify that the soot is gone.  And
you may as well GET BAR--you'll need it.

We're done downstairs, and in fact we're done with the castle.  Go
SOUTH, EAST, and UP.  (Notice that you can bring the iron kettle up
this way, just not down.  Hmm...)

Go on ahead out of the castle area: EAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTH, SOUTH,
WEST, and WEST.

Now it's time to enter the long building by going SOUTHWEST.
There's only one door you can get to at this point.  Go SOUTH and
SOUTHWEST into the Hall, and you'll hear a voice from the WEST.  Go
there.

Probably it's no surprise who you find here--who else would say
"Polly wanna cracker"?  Go ahead and X PARROT, X PACKET, X BRANCH, and
X WINDOW.  Wait around a few turns if you want, to hear the parrot say
amusing things.  I found references to Zork, Pink Floyd's The Wall,
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and some things I didn't
understand.  When you get bored with that, GET PACKET.  Finally, you
can see that this parrot repeats everything it hears, so try to ASK
PARROT ABOUT CODE.  Yep, it works.  Remember the number.

GETTING PETRA'S CODE
--------------------

One more to go.  And it's also in this building, although you can't get
there from here.  From the parrot's room, go EAST three times, then NORTH,
WEST, and SOUTHWEST.  You've gone all the way around the building.  X SOFA,
X DOOR, and finally X WINDOW.  Uh-oh, that doesn't look promising, but you
have to try.  Go ahead and OPEN WINDOW, and go EAST to get inside.  The dog
might not like you, but he didn't stop you from entering.

Now, you have something that might distract him, that you picked up way
back in the kitchen early on.  X MEAT.  We want to get the dog outside,
so THROW MEAT THROUGH WINDOW.  The dog is *almost* outside, but he just
needs a little help... PUSH DOG and he will be outside.  Quickly, go EAST
before he gets back in--you only have one turn.

In this room you can X CLOSET and OPEN IT.  X COVERALLS, GET THEM, and
WEAR THEM.  Now you can face the dog with a little protection.  Go back
WEST and X DOG.  That necklace looks interesting.  X NECKLACE.  X BOX.
OPEN BOX and GET NOTE.  READ THE NOTE and remember the number--it's the
last code!

GETTING INTO THE SECURITY LAB
-----------------------------

Time to go input the codes.  We have to get one more item first, though.
Go WEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, and SOUTH to end up in front of a storage shed.
You may as well DROP IRON KETTLE--you won't need it again, and it's from
the castle, so it would get you in trouble to take it inside.  Then
UNLOCK SHED DOOR WITH KEY (the key you went to such pains to get in
the castle) and OPEN SHED DOOR.  Go NORTHEAST to enter the shed.

X JUNK a few times for some amusing messages (including another
Hitchhiker's Guide reference).  Then X SACK.  See how it protects
against biological waste?  Wonder if it would do any good against
radiation... like beta radiation... like the kind that the sphere gives
off.  Better GET SACK.  Then we can head inside.

Go SOUTH three times, then EAST and SOUTH again.  X SMOKE DETECTOR
(although it doesn't tell you much).  Our goal is to lure Schwartz out
of his office so we can fiddle with his security camera.  Save the game
here, because the timing seems to matter in this section.  GET CIGARETTE
AND LIGHTER, then LIGHT CIGARETTE and DROP IT.  Whoa, you don't want to be
caught hanging around here.  Hightail it SOUTH, SOUTH again, WEST, and
SOUTH.  Schwartz will run into you on the way, going to turn off the
alarm, and he'll also scold you about smoking, but fortunately he doesn't
do anything more serious to you.

Now's your chance--PRESS REWIND and then PRESS PLAY.  His cameras will
only show old footage, rather than showing him you entering the door.
(If your score doesn't go up by four points, the timing was wrong and
you'll have to try again.)

I don't think there was any great rush, but there's no need to dawdle
around either.  Go NORTH and EAST.  Then go NORTH three times, WEST twice,
and SOUTH twice.  Finally, go EAST and you'll see the keypad.

Now you can type in all the codes you got: the one from the dog, the one
from Stefan's office, the one from the parrot, and the one John told you.
You can type them in any order.  Just TYPE XXX ON KEYPAD, with no quote
marks.  After all four have been correctly entered, the door will open.
Go EAST.

WINNING THE GAME
----------------

There isn't a lot of time to waste, and besides you don't need anything
else in the room.  So just GET SPHERE and PUT IT IN SACK (to protect
yourself from radiation poisoning).  Now you've got to get out of here,
so go WEST twice, NORTH twice, EAST once, and NORTH twice again to get
to the Yard outside.

SOUTHEAST, EAST, DOWN, and SOUTH brings you to that familiar-looking door.
Only, now you can open it.  That bar you have will fit over the handle.
I tried some weird phrasing here, but OPEN DOOR WITH BAR is all you need.
Go on out to the SOUTH.  (X SCOOTER and TURN ON SCOOTER for some amusing
messages.)  By now you should recognize your surroundings--go UP twice and
you're way back at the parking lot.  It should be pretty simple from here...
The aliens wanted you to bring the sphere back to the place where they
stopped your car.  So ENTER CAR, TURN ON ENGINE and go EAST.

Congratulations, you won!  If you followed this walkthrough, you should

walkthrough is provided at the end, but using it except as a last resort
will spoil your fun.

Now, to become regent you'll need to eliminate five rivals: War Minister
Klaus Wehrkeit, Christ Minister Pierre Bonfleche, Interior Minister Variola
Modo, Coffers Minister Argento Rico, and Prince Louis. Don't worry about
Ambassador to China Marco Pulisci (you can call China and find out he's
already dead).

WEHRKEIT

Wehrkeit is fighting the Venetians but soon learns of the king's death and
retreats to Piedmont. If you do nothing, he will arrive around 3 o'clock
and kill you. When you ask Miss Sierra about Venice, she will give you a
piece of information that the Venetians might be interested in and which
may threaten Wehrkeit's position. You need to contact Venice via the
telephone in the throne room. For some money, Miss Sierra will also give
you the necessary telephone codes. But you have to ask her in time, because
at some point Rico will bribe Sierra to give you a false access code which
triggers a booby trap.

Wehrkeit will still arrive and may still kill you if you run into him and
don't react quickly. But he's badly injured, and you can either kill him or
just keep away from him and wait till you get the news of his death.

BONFLECHE

Bonfleche is tutoring Prince Charles until he gets the news of the king's
death. Soon afterward he leaves for Avignon and organizes an invasion of
Piedmont by Avignese forces. He must be killed while he's still in the
palace. If you use the spying equipment in your quarters to monitor
Bonfleche's quarters, you can witness some extremely unseemly conduct on
his part at 2 o'clock. Record it with your master key and show it to Miss
Sierra. She'll take care of him.

MODO

Modo is doing experiments with green slime in an underground lab. To get to
him, you need the vials from his quarters. You don't want to go in there,
but with a hostile tone you can order the guard in. Then tell him to get
the vials. You also the need the gas mask from the royal quarters. Now go
to the fountain in the courtyard. Put the yellow liquid and then the pink
liquid in the funnel. Push the loose tile, use the gas mask, and go
down. You'll find Modo there. Kill him before he kills you. Don't forget to
pull the cord to prevent the spread of the green haze.

RICO

Rico is in his quarters most of the time. If you talk to Princess Charlotte
in the palace asylum, she will tell you about the unseemly things he's done
to her. Unfasten her straitjacket and she will follow you. Go to Rico and
give her the dagger from your quarters. (She would dispatch of Louis and
Bonfleche in the same way, but once she has killed one, she will be taken
away. Since you have other ways to eliminate Louis and Bonfleche, it's
advisable to have her kill Rico.)

LOUIS

Louis sits in the courtyard all the time. There are two balconies above the
courtyard. Prince Charles is playing with a heavy toy car in the royal
quarters. But before you can do the obvious, you have to get the car from
the prince. You have to give him something else so that he lets you take
the car. Among Rico's junk is a nice toy robot. Get it while Rico is out of
his room.


The timing is most critical in this game. You have to do everything before
the showdown with Wehrkeit, so don't lose time wandering around aimlessly.

Hints for Inside Woman by Andy Phillips
=======================================

These are in the style of an Infocom Invisiclues hint booklet.

There are however no fake questions, and everything is relevant.

Except for the prologue, the hints are categorised according to Arcology level.

Only look at the hints if a question seems relevant to a particular problem you
have, otherwise you risk confusing yourself and spoiling the game.

These are official hints by the author, but feel free to provide a step by step 
walkthrough or other alternative solution for the game if you wish to do so.


=======================

==================================
---INDUSTRIAL LEVELS (11 to 15)---
==================================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: How do I get to the industrial levels?

H1a: You can't straight away.
H1b: Don't bother until you've been to your apartment.
H1c: Have you read the guidebook? The section on ranks?
H1d: One level is accessible immediately...
H1e: ...the free market on level 13.
H1f: For the others you need a work permit.
H1g: You'll get one for level 12 eventually.
H1h: The other industrial levels are out of bounds...
H1i: ...and are not important to the game.


LEVEL 12 - AGRICULTURAL & BIODOME
---------------------------------

Q1: How do I get to level 12?

H1a: You'll know when you need to.
H1b: Don't continue unless you're a class two citizen.
H1c: You've met someone who had a task for you.
H1d: Who said to come back as a class two citizen.
H1e: Go and see Professor Zacharias. He'll issue a work permit.


Q2: I'm on level 12. Where do I go?

H2a: Remember Professor Zacharias' instructions.
H2b: You need to get the the secure area.
H2c: The biodome is to the east.
H2d: Past the security guns, USF guard and laserfence.


Q3: How do I get past the sentry guns?

H3a: Have you tried examining the cannons?
H3b: Nanci's opinion is invaluable.
H3c: The weapons have various sensors which you need to confuse.
H3d: There's a way to confuse them nearby.
H3e: You'll need various items to get through.
H3f: Hints on what to do next are given below.


Q4: How does the crop duster work?

H4a: It flies and sprays crops.
H4b: When it's switched on and has something to spray.
H4c: It can also carry a passenger.
H4d: If it was spraying something to confuse the sensors,
     you could avoid those nasty sentry cannons.
H4e: You'll need to fill the tube.
H4f: And find three more...
H4g: Extra tubes are in the hive.


Q5: I keep getting stung by the bees!

H5a: Don't open the door then.
H5b: Pity you need those tubes.
H5c: Your suit offers great body protection.
H5d: But your head is exposed.
H5e: Do you have something to cover it with?
H5f: It's a little unconventional but it'll work.
H5g: Go to the hive and wear the empty pail on your head.
H5h: Now you can open the door safely.
H5i: Just remember to close it when you're done.


Q6: I spilled all the honey when I got the plastic tubes.

H6a: Is there any way to see what you're doing?
H6b: No. There is not.
H6c: The honey isn't useful at all.
H6d: And you can't avoid spilling it.
H6e: Only the tubes are important here.


Q7: What should I do with the plastic tubes?

H7a: Have you found all four of them?
H7b: Including the one inside the crop duster?
H7c: They provide liquid for the duster to spray.
H7d: But you don't need fertiliser.
H7e: What you need is something to block the cannon's sensors.
H7f: There are four sensors, so you need four liquids.
H7g: You can fill the tubes using the compost machine in the silo.
H7h: Place a tube underneath and put something in the funnel.
H7i: Hints on what you need are given below.


Q8: What do I need to confuse the UV sensor?

H8a: Something bright and colourful would mask you.
H8b: Have you seen anything bright and colourful around?
H8c: Those berries are bright, glowing and purple.


Q9: What do I need to confuse the heat sensor?

H9a: What's the opposite of hot?
H9b: Something cool would shield you.
H9c: You don't need the compost machine for this.
H9d: Look for a cool liquid.
H9e: Water from the trough.


Q10: What do I need to confuse the radar?

H10a: Radar works on sending out waves.
H10b: Military craft use chaff to confuse radar.
H10c: Made up of tiny pieces of metal.
H10d: Is there something metallic around?
H10e: The pail is too big to fit in the machine...
H10f: ...but that handle seems loose.
H10g: Take the pail's handle.
H10h: There's your source of metal flakes.


Q11: What do I need to confuse the sniffer?

H11a: Something foul smelling would screw up this sensor.
H11b: Such stuff is often used as fertiliser.
H11c: Some er... poo would do the job.
H11d: See the hints for Q12 below.
H11e: When you've got the stuff, put it in the compost machine.


Q12: Where do I find something smelly?

H12a: Those animals in the pens are real.
H12b: And they're not wearing bodysuits to filter excrement.
H12c: The pigs need a little help.
H12d: Is there anything that could cause indigestion?
H12e: Prunes might accelerate the process.
H12f: The pigs won't touch them in solid form.
H12g: Fill a tube with prune juice, add it to the trough and voila.


Q13: I have four separate liquids. What next?

H13a: You're all set. Hop on the crop duster, insert a tube and turn it on.
H13b: You'll face four sentry cannons in a row.
H13c: Notice which sensor is active and load the spray cannon accordingly.


Q14: How do I take out the USF guard by the laserfence?

H14a: You can't unless you're close.
H14b: First concentrate on bypassing the sentry cannons - see above hints.
H14c: You can take the man by surprise.
H14d: A powerful blow would knock him out.
H14e: Like a fully grown woman dropping on him from above.
H14f: Jump on the USF guard when you're hovering above him.


Q15: How do I disable the laserfence?

H15a: Remember what happened on the landing pad at the start?
H15b: Guards carry devices to deactivate the fences.
h15c: And the man's holding such a device in his hand.


Q16: I can't get the control device.

H16a: His grip is very tight, no?
H16b: Is there anything around to cut him with?
H16c: Something very close by.
H16d: Those lasers would cut through anything.
H16e: The USF guard is too heavy to lift.
H16e: So push him into the laserfence.


Q17: I don't know the code to deactivate the fence.

H17a: The guard doesn't look that bright.
H17b: He'd need to write the code down or a clue to it.
H17c: Have you searched the guard?
H17d: You can remove part of his uniform.
H17e: Take the man's helmet.
H17f: Before you go trying it on, take a look at it.
H17g: Colour of beams. That's the clue.
H17h: Crimson is too long a word. Is there a simpler one?
H17i: The code is RED.
H17j: Set the dials from bottom to top and then press the switch.


Q18: I can't get inside the biodome.

H18a: Those guards seem very alert.
H18b: They won't let anyone through.
H18c: Except perhaps another USF trooper.
H18d: The guard's helmet can cover your face.
H18e: But your bodysuit jewels will give you away.
H18f: Have you explored the area around the biodome?
H18g: Got the pickaxe? Seen the oil fields?
H18h: Oil is black... like USF trooper jewels.
H18i: The oil is extracted and siphoned off...
H18j: ...by underground pipes.
H18k: Dig in the oil field with the pickaxe.
H18l: You'll need to hurry before the suit cleans.
H18m: And you can't carry anything into the biodome.


Q19: I'm inside the biodome. Now what?

H19a: There's evidence of an operation here.
H19b: So take the virus vial with you.


Q20: Ruby Eagle showed up! What do I do?

H20a: There's no way to avoid the encounter.
H20b: Ruby is an expert markswoman and doesn't miss her target.
H20c: You can't run or dodge the shot.
H20d: If she had another target...
H20e: ...something that was a threat...
H20f: ...she might target that instead of you.
H20g: Do you have anything suitable?
H20h: You've only had it for a minute.
H20i: Throw the vial at Ruby Eagle.


Q21: I've been contaminated with the virus!

H21a: You need to find an antidote obviously.
H21b: Except you don't have access to one.
H21c: The female scientist does.
H21d: Like Nanci says, it's either her or you.
H21e: Spies often make immoral choices.
H21f: Attack the woman and swallow the pill.
H21g: There's no way to save her without dying.


Q22: Where can I hide from Ruby Eagle?

H22a: You're trapped in the biodome.
H22b: Nanci provides important information shortly afterwards.
H22c: Ruby Eagle has X-ray vision.
H22d: So you need to shield yourself.
H22e: The locker has a radiation shield.
H22f: And the scientist opened it before she died.
H22g: So she must have a passcard.
H22h: Search the scientist's labcoat to find it.
H22i: Now you can open the locker and get inside.
H22j: By itself that won't be enough.


Q23: The wristwatch light gives me away!

H23a: It switches on in the dark.
H23b: And it's dark inside the locker.
H23c: Ruby has excellent vision.
H23d: If the blue light wasn't noticeable...
H23e: Have you looked at the control panel?
H23f: The lights in the biodome can be adjusted.
H23g: You need to know the wavelength of the wristwatch light.
H23h: The wavelength dial shows the current light in the room.
H23i: Focus on the dial to get a hint from Nanci.
H23j: If the dial was set outside the visible spectrum, it would be dark.
H23k: So turn the dial to below 380 or above 749.
H23l: Now look at the dial to get a reading.
H23m: And change the dial to that setting.


Q24: How do I avoid Ruby's thermal vision?

H24a: Have you looked at the control panel?
H24b: The temperature in the biodome can be adjusted.
H24c: If it was the same as your body temperature, you wouldn't show up.
H24d: So you need to know your temperature.
H24e: Have you looked at the thermometer and the temperature dial?
H24f: The thermometer is marked in degrees Celsius, the dial in Kelvin.
H24g: Kelvin is always the Celsius temperature plus 273.
H24h: Have you tried touching the thermometer?
H24i: Seems like a low reading. Could be the gloves.
H24j: Could you get a more accurate reading?
H24k: Think of how doctors measure body temperature.
H24l: Taste the thermometer.
H24m: Add 273 to the reading and set the temperature dial to that.


Q25: Ruby still finds me!

H25a: If she mentions seeing blue, you didn't set the wavelength dial correctly.
H25b: If she starts by saying you look hot, you didn't set the temperature correctly.
H25c: Notice that Ruby goes to the dead woman.
H25d: There's no way out of the biodome, which means you must be inside.
H25e: And the dead woman is obviously a scientist.
H25f: Her face is unrecognisable.
H25g: Ruby might mistake her for you if it wasn't obvious.
H25h: Take the woman's lab coat off her and take it with you into the locker.


Q26: I've managed to hide from Ruby Eagle. How do I defeat her?

H26a: She won't be fooled for long.
H26b: You need to surprise her, so step out of the locker straight away.
H26c: She's got you in her sights again.
H26d: As long as she can see you, there's nothing you can do.
H26e: Could you block her vision somehow?
H26f: With something large?
H26g: Throw the labcoat at her.
H26h: You have time for one action only.
H26i: Her armour protects her body.
H26j: But if you disarmed Ruby Eagle...
H26k: Grab the plasma rifle. That'll take care of her.


Q27: Ruby's dead but I've got no evidence.

H27a: You've seen the evidence. That's all that's required.
H27b: If you haven't found the evidence in the casino on level 29, go there.
H27c: Otherwise head to Utopia Studios on level 27. The gate is open now.


Q28: How do I get back past the sentry cannons?

H28a: The crop duster can't be accessed now.
H28b: But you have the means to permanently disable the cannons.
H28c: Use Ruby's plasma rifle to shoot them.
H28d: Just don't go carrying the weapon into the transporter ring.


Q29: Is there any point to visiting the biodome?

H29a: Physical evidence can't be retrieved.
H29b: But you need to discover what's going on to progress.
H29c: There's something the biodome has that'll be useful later on.
H29d: An adjustable light setting.
H29e: Something will show up in the right light.
H29f: You'll know what when you've found the clue.


LEVEL 13 - FREE MARKET
----------------------

Q1: What's the point of the swapshop?

H1a: For swapping items, obviously.
H1b: It's a one for one trade system.
H1c: You need to find something valuable to trade.
H1d: Many illegal items are valuable.
H1e: Such as cyberjacks or the morphtool.
H1f: And subbuteo pieces.
H1g: There are other things too.


Q2: Which item do I need from the swapshop?

H2a: Is there anything in particular you need?
H2b: Eventually you'll need all three items.
H2c: But one is crucial immediately.
H2d: Have you listened to the homeless man?
H2e: Remember the interface port in the guidebot?
H2f: You need the octagonal headed cyberjack.


Q3: What should I swap for the cyberjack?

H3a: You don't have many items.
H3b: The smuggler was bringing in the morphtool...
H3c: ...so it has value.
H3d: Unfortunately, you need it to open the robot's access panel.
H3e: ...which you can only do in the apartment.
H3f: Try to leave and the robot closes the panel again.
H3g: You need both the morphtool and cyberjack...
H3h: ...so you need to find something valuable.
H3i: You can find that in the retirement home on level 20.


Q4: What about the homeless man?

H4a: What about him?
H4b: Have you listened to him?
H4c: What he says is crucial.
H4d: In particular the guidebot, Jack and the quotas.
H4e: Remember the numbers -- 500 credits and 8 hours.
H4f: You'll need that information later.


Q5: I can't find Jack.

H5a: If he's a friend, he should be close by.
H5b: The man isn't talking about a person.
H5c: Remember the interface port inside the droid's panel?
H5d: The homeless man is telling you discreetly that you need something.
H5e: The octagonal headed cyberjack in the swapshop.


Q6: What about speaking Jack's language?

H6a: The man likes his cryptic riddles.
H6b: He's referring to something you need to use cyberjacks.
H6c: You have a cashcard. Have you tried buying something from him?
H6d: You need to be more discreet. Listen to the man's comments.
H6e: He keeps mentioning 'money to burn'.
H6f: Put the cashcard in the barrel.
H6g: No good? The man doesn't give nothing for free...
H6h: ...or a measly ten credits.
H6i: You need more money on your account.
H6j: You'll need to work for it.
H6k: And you can't reach the industrial levels.
H6l: But not everybody works in industry.
H6m: You can find a job on level 17, so go there.


Q7: I paid the homeless man, but he gave me nothing in return.

H7a: He's paranoid, remember?
H7b: He'll leave the item for you.
H7c: In a very safe place.
H7d: He has ways of getting places normally restricted.
H7e: Did you hear what the man said?
H7f: Go home. Chill out. Have a good rest.
H7g: Anywhere you could do those things?
H7h: The location should be obvious.
H7i: The homeless man put the item in your apartment...
H7j: ...in the cryobed.


Q8: How do I save the man in the Cards Galore store?

H8a: Looks like you got there too late.
H8b: You'll get the chance to avenge him (much) later.
H8c: The items he left behind are important.


Q9: What's the membership pass for?

H9a: Have you tried reading the pass?
H9b: It's for the Waterline Club on level 16...
H9c: ...but it won't do you much good as it stands.


Q10: What about the calendar?

H10a: It tells you the year.
H10b: But there are no important dates...
H10c: ...on the page you can see.
H10d: Remember there are twelve months in a year.
H10e: Four important dates are marked.
H10f: This information will prove valuable later.


Q11: The rusty nail is useless. Right?

H11a: Right. And wrong.
H11b: The nail itself is useless...
H11c: ...but it hides something important.
H11d: Have you tried moving the nail? Pulling it?
H11e: You need to be more forceful. Alice is pretty tough.
H11f: Don't worry about breaking a nail.


Q12: What good is the star shaped interface port?

H12a: A lot of good actually.
H12b: Have you seen anything similar?
H12c: You may not have used one yet.
H12d: It's the same idea as the octagonal port in the guidebot.
H12e: The port is for accessing cyberspace.
H12f: But you'll need a star shaped cyberjack.
H12g: You can't get one until you have access to the education levels.
H12h: Which requires you to be a class three citizen.
H12i: Which requires you to hack into the guidebot.
H12j: When you've done all that...
H12k: ...you can find what you need in the school on level 21.


Q13: What's the printing machine for?

H13a: Printing naturally.
H13b: But there's more to it...
H13c: Remember what the executive accused the store owner of?
H13d: He's a forger.
H13e: You can use the machine to forge a membership pass.


Q14: What goes in the two slots on the printing machine?

H14a: Look at the shapes.
H14b: One item can be found very close by.
H14c: The membership pass goes in the thin slot.
H14d: The second slot is circular.
H14e: Two items might work. Both are on level 25.
H14f: You can't get them until you've got access to the education levels.
H14g: A circular headed cyberjack might fit...
H14h: ...but it's not an interface port.
H14i: See the hints about helping the student on level 25 if you haven't.
H14j: The student gave you a circular item.
H14k: The datastick is what you need.


Q15: I put the items in the printing machine, but nothing happened.

H15a: Have a good look around the store.
H15b: See the above hints about the nail and interface port.
H15c: You need to do the rest in cyberspace.


Q16: I entered cyberspace. How do I get past the security door?

H16a: Have you examined the door?
H16b: The symbols?
H16c: It's a combination lock.
H16d: Notice the numbers on the dial - 101 to 1231 with some
     missing.
H16e: The numbers correspond to dates.
H16f: Where would the owner write important dates?
H16g: Look at the calendar. See the hints for level 13 if you're 
     missing something.
H16h: The four marked dates correspond to the symbols.
H16g: In order you need the wedding anniversary, Christmas Day,
     April Fool's Day and the birthday.
H16i: Turn the dial to 204, 1225, 401 and 1117 in that order.
H16j: That will unlock it.


Q17: What's the purpose of the printing press in cyberspace?

H17a: Have you seen a printer in the real world?
H17b: This is the control system.
H17c: Notice the track. You can push it along.
H17d: And turn the handle if you set the printing machine right.


Q18: I've got three printing plates, but they're all blank.

H18a: That's because you didn't provide enough information.
H18b: You need to put the correct item in the circular slot on
      the Cards Galore store machine.
H18c: See the hints above.


Q19: The handle on the printing press doesn't turn.

H19a: Something's missing from the machine in the store.
H19b: There needs to be something in the thin slot.
H19c: See the above hints.


Q20: I've got some weird stuff on the printing plates.

H20a: They're the images stored on the datastick.
H20b: The ones already on there are no good.
H20c: You'll need to take some pictures in the real world.
H20d: That requires the camera from Pete's Swapshop.


Q21: What pictures should I take?

H21a: Remember what you're trying to forge.
H21b: Did you examine the man's pass?
H21c: It has a picture on the left and an ID number on the right.
H21d: You need to substitute his details for your own.
H21e: Which means you need pictures of your face and ID number.
H21f: The first should be obvious. The second is close to home too.
H21g: Take pictures of your face and your ID tag.
H21h: What's on the third plate doesn't matter.


Q22: I've got the pictures, but don't know how to work the printing press.

H22a: Have you tried experimenting to see what happens to the pass?
H22b: Whenever you turn the handle with a plate in the press, it stamps
      that image on the corresponding side of the member pass.
H22c: You need to print the picture of your face on the left, so put the
      corresponding plate in the press, make sure the press is at the left
      hand of the track then turn the handle.
H22d: Repeat the procedure with the ID tag image on the right hand side. Push
      the press if needed.
H22e: The forged pass will get you into the Waterline Club.

---RESIDENTIAL LEVELS---
========================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: Why can't I visit all the residential levels?

H1a: You're still an immigrant.
H1b: You need to find your apartment...
H1c: ...and repair the guidebot.


Q2: How do I get out of the residential levels?

H2a: You're not restricted to just the residential levels.
H2b: Once you've repaired the guidebot, you can go to level 13 also.
H2c: But you need to go elsewhere to complete your mission.
H2d: Which means advancing to class three citizen status.


Q3: How do I advance to class three citizen status?

H3a: You need to advance to inductee status first.
H3b: Have you visited the free market?
H3c: And listened to the homeless man?
H3d: You need to work 8 hours and earn 500 credits.
H3e: Unfortunately that's impossible, though you can make a start.
H3f: The only way to proceed is to hack into the guidebot.


Q4: How do I hack into the guidebot?

H4a: You need to open its access panel.
H4b: Which you can only do when it's recharging inside the apartment.
H4c: You'll need the morphtool.
H4d: And something for the interface port - see hints for level 18.
H4e: You need both items at the same time.
H4f: And also need to 'speak Jack's language'.
H4g: More hints for these problems are in the level 13 section.
H4h: Once you've swallowed the blue capsule, you can use the cyberjack.
H4i: Provided you're wearing it on your finger.


Q5: I lost all my things when I entered cyberspace!

H5a: Have you examined yourself?
H5b: You're a cyberspace avatar.
H5c: You and your items are in the real world.
H5d: Cyberspace is completely separate.


Q6: What happened to the clock?

H6a: Have you tried waiting?
H6b: Notice what happens when you leave cyberspace?
H6c: Time stops when you're in cyberspace.


Q7: How do I get through the firewall?

H7a: Have you tried going across?
H7b: It might be a good idea to study the pattern.
H7c: You have to avoid the flames... obviously.
H7d: The flaming sequence is on a loop.
H7e: Wait until the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 8th vents flame then head north.
H7f: Sometimes you can't go forward. So stand still or move backwards.
H7g: Still stuck?
H7h: After going north: wait (1st), go north (2nd), wait (2nd),
     north (3rd), north (4th), south (3rd), north (4th), north (5th),
     wait (5th), north (6th), north (7th), south (6th), north (7th),
     north (8th), north (finish)


Q8: What should I do in the guidebot's brain?

H8a: Remember why you hacked in.
H8b: See any pattern between the numbers in the tubes and the real
     world situation?
H8c: Have you examined the tubes?
H8d: The tubes show the credits you've made (095) and the paid hours
     you worked at Luigi's (2).
H8e: You need to alter the number positions.
H8f: The requirements for advancing to class three status are 500
     credits and 8 hours -- at least.
H8g: Only one digit is large enough to satisfy the hour requirement.
H8h: Put the number 9 in the short tube.
H8i: There are two possible solutions.
H8j: But 5 must be on top in the long tube.
H8k: So change it to 502 or 520. It doesn't matter which.


Q9: I've done that. What now?

H9a: Remember the colour coding?
H9b: Class three citizens have green jewels.
H9c: Push the emerald when you're done with the tubes.
H9d: Now you can leave the residential levels.


Q10: How do I leave space?

H10a: In most cases you can leave voluntarily. Simply exit.
H10b: Damage to your avatar automatically jacks you out.
H10c: As does completing an important task.


LEVEL 16 - WATERLINE CLUB
-------------------------

Q1: How do I get into the Waterline Club?

H1a: The steel barrier is a problem.
H1b: You can only get in at certain times of day.
H1c: The club is open from 22:00 to 04:00.
H1d: But there's the problem of the bouncer.
H1e: Have you tried attacking her? Talking to her?
H1f: Looks like you need a membership pass.
H1g: There's one on level 13, in the free market.
H1h: It's in the Cards Galore shop.
H1i: Have you tried using it?
H1j: The pass is no use with another person's face and ID.
H1k: So you need to forge a pass for yourself.
H1l: Remember what the woman said in the Cards Galore shop?
H1m: The man was a forger so...
H1n: ...the equipment you need is in the shop.
H1o: See the hints for level 13 for more information.


Q2: Are the posters in the orange light district useful?

H2a: Not at first.
H2b: The times are important though.
H2c: They're not of use until you've gotten into the club.
H2d: Remember the meeting protocol?
H2e: You need to hear blue. Is there a time you could do that?
H2f: The blues hour is from 01:00 to 01:59.


Q3: I've gotten into the Waterline Club. Now what?

H3a: Have you tried exploring?
H3b: Have you noticed the posters outside?
H3c: And the Agave bottle? And the dance floor?
H3d: There's a lot of blue stuff around.
H3e: Remember Nanci's comment when you entered?
H3f: About touching, hearing, tasting, and seeing blue?
H3g: This is the meeting point for the resistance.
H3h: Appropriate hints for each part are below.


Q4: How do I touch blue?

H4a: You don't need to touch it with your hands.
H4b: But you do need to be in contact with something blue.
H4c: The Ocean is blue.
H4d: The closest thing in the club is the dance floor, so go there.


Q5: How do I see blue?

H5a: You need to touch blue first. See the hints above.
H5b: Have you looked at things on the dance floor?
H5c: The stage lights? One is broken. Could that help?
H5d: Remember what happens when you're in darkness.
H5e: The watch will activate its blue light.
H5f: So you need to stand in a dark place.
H5g: Stand underneath the broken stage light.


Q6: How do I hear blue?

H6a: You can hear something in the club.
H6b: The music...
H6c: ...but it's so bad listening won't do any good.
H6d: If only you knew what was playing.
H6e: The posters outside the club give the information.
H6f: See the hints for Q2 if you haven't done so.
H6g: You can only meet the contact between 01:00 and 01:59.


Q7: How do I taste blue?

H7a: You need something blue to eat or drink, obviously.
H7b: The capsule you bought was blue...
H7c: ...but you already used that. Is there something else?
H7d: The bottle of blue Agave.
H7e: Drink that at the appropriate place and time, and 
     the contact will show up.


Q8: I can't open the bottle of Blue Agave.

H8a: Simple. Open the top.
H8b: Except it's stuck. Have you looked at the shape?
H8c: Small and square, like a bolt.
H8d: You need a tool to loosen it...
H8e: ...like a wrench.
H8f: Or the morphtool.


Q9: My contact gave me this air freshener. What now?

H9a: Remember what Nanci said. You need to smell blue.
H9b: Have you examined the air freshener?
H9c: Spray that and you'll smell blue.
H9d: But you need to do it in a specific place.
H9e: Remember what the contact said...
H9f: Go freshen up was a hint.
H9g: There's a place for freshening up in the club.
H9h: The washroom.
H9i: Try spraying the air freshener in there.
H9j: You need a specific target.
H9k: Try spraying the mirror.


Q10: I keep getting captured in the Waterline Club.

H10a: You've been caught blue handed, so to speak.
H10b: There's no way out, and you only have time for one action.
H10c: You need to remove the incriminating evidence.
H10d: Clean the mirror before the USF show up.
H10e: If you need to see the message, you can spray the mirror again
      after they leave.


Q11: How do I rescue the contact?

H11a: You can't. She's on her own.
H11b: But remember the choker the executive wears. And the whip she has.
H11c: It's useful for another puzzle.


Q12: What does the cryptic blue message mean?

H12a: You have a name - Zacharias.
H12b: All the twos. Is there anything it could refer to?
H12c: Could be a time...
H12d: ...or a place.
H12e: Actually it's both. Find the place first.
H12f: Have you tried going to level 2?
H12g: Guess not. Any other level that fits the description?
H12h: The library on level 22. That's where to go next.


LEVEL 17 - CAFETERIA & MESS HALL
--------------------------------

Q1: What's the carrier bag for?

H1a: Um... carrying things.
H1b: A lot of things.
H1c: An unlimited number of things, which is handy.


Q2: Is there anything to buy at the food outlets?

H2a: Not unless you have money.
H2b: You should have found the cashcard in your apartment.
H2c: If you have more than 10 credits, don't waste them here.
H2d: The items in the vending machine are too expensive...
H2e: ...and so are the pizzas.
H2f: But there's one cheap store around.
H2g: You can buy a prawn cracker from Cheap Faux Chinese for 10 credits.


Q3: What use is the prawn cracker?

H3a: You can't judge everything by its looks.
H3b: Try eating it.
H3c: No good? What would you do if you were served terrible food?
H3d: Take the cracker back to the serving woman and show it her.


Q4: I don't see the point of returning the food.

H4a: Have you tried complaining to the serving woman?
H4b: Do you really think you could better than her?
H4c: Well do you?
H4d: Being polite isn't always the best course of action.
H4e: Show the serving woman the cracker then answer yes.
H4f: Now you have somewhere else to go.


Q5: What's the purpose of the Luigi's Pizza restaurant?

H5a: To serve pizza of course.
H5b: And not very good from the look of things.
H5c: There's a menu outside though...
H5d: ...which you'll need later on.
H5e: The owner is around for the evening shift (18:00-00:00).
H5f: But he's not much help unless you need him.
H5g: Deal with Cheap Faux Chinese first (see the above hints).
H5h: Don't continue until you know of an opportunity.
H5i: Ask Luigi about the job. He'll tell you to come back
     at 22:00 either today or tomorrow (depending on the time).


Q6: I've got a job. Now what?

H6a: Luigi gave you the instructions.
H6b: Be at Luigi's at the time and day he specified.
H6c: If you're late, don't worry. You'll get another chance.


Q7: What should I do in the kitchen?

H7a: What do you think?
H7b: Get cooking Alice!
H7c: The assistant gives you the instructions after a minute or two.
H7d: You need to cook a pizza, serve a drink and print out a bill.
H7e: Put all three items on the serving bot's tray.
H7f: And you need to do this three times to get paid.


Q8: How do I cook a pizza?

H8a: You've got the ingredients.
H8b: And the pizza base.
H8c: Put the required ingredients on the base then the pizza in the oven.
H8d: Keep a close eye on it. You don't want it overcooked...
H8e: ...or undercooked.
H8f: Cooking a pizza takes around 10 minutes.
H8g: Time is limited, so start the pizza first in each order,
     and deal with the other stuff later.


Q9: How do I complete the first order?

H9a: The customer wanted a Corny Chick pizza and lemonade.
H9b: You'll need the printed menu.
H9c: Corny Chick requires chicken and sweetcorn, so cook that.
H9d: And dispense a lemonade from the drinks machine.
H9e: Add up the price on the menu. The bill comes to 30 credits.
H9f: Put everything on the tray, and you should get another order.


Q10: I screwed up in the kitchen!

H10a: If you make a mistake and realise it, you can throw the unwanted
      item (pizza, bill or drink) into the trash receptacle.
H10b: If Luigi kicks you out, listen to what he says.
H10c: Getting the order wrong means the pizza or drink was wrong.
H10d: Not being able to do basic math means the bill was for the wrong price.
H10e: Don't worry. Luigi is the forgiving type, so you get as many 
      chances as you want.


Q11: How do I complete the second order?

H11a: The customer is a vegeterian and wants at least two toppings.
H11b: But you can't serve them just anything.
H11c: It needs to be a priced item on the menu.
H11d: Mama's Garden is the pizza you want.
H11e: So add mushrooms, onions and sweetcorn to the base then cook it.
H11f: Dispense a coffee and print out the bill for 30 credits.
H11g: When you're done, put everything on the tray.


Q12: What's the pizza for the third order?

H12a: The customer ordered a special.
H12b: Did you see the board outside the restaurant?
H12c: The special is either Feasty Meaty, Mama's Garden or Fiery Luigi.
H12d: They revolve on a three day cycle.
H12e: Make a note of which before you enter the kitchen.


Q13: The kitchen drinks machine doesn't dispense cola!

H13a: Have you tried operating the machine?
H13b: It's out of cola...
H13c: ...and there's none in the kitchen.
H13d: Have you seen anything else that might dispense cola?
H13e: It's on the same level.
H13f: The vending machine dispenses soft drinks.
H13g: But you have no money.
H13h: Who says you have to pay?
H13i: Give the vending machine a good thump.
H13j: When you enter the kitchen, take the Tricola with you.
H13k: Now open the can, then pour the cola in the empty cup.
H13l: If you screw up and use the can, the vending machine has 
      more cola.


Q14: I'm getting the pricing wrong on the third order.

H14a: Have you added up the prices for the pizza and soft drink?
H14b: Remember the customer ordered a special.
H14c: Read the menu again, especially the last line.
H14d: Ordering a special means the drink is free...
H14e: So charge the customer for the pizza only.


Q15: After all that I finally got paid. What should I do with the money?

H15a: Have you been to the 'free' market on level 13?
H15b: Listen to the homeless man if you haven't done so.
H15c: He has something for you now you have extra capital.
H15d: See the hints for the Free Market level for what to do next.


LEVEL 18 - STANDARD APARTMENTS
------------------------------

Q1: I made it to the apartment level. Where should I go?

H1a: All the exits from the transporter ring lead south.
H1b: Gone there?
H1c: You were assigned a guide, so follow it.
H1d: Head south after the guidebot.


Q2: The guidebot broke down. What next?

H2a: You can't rely on the guidebot for help then.
H2b: Obviously you need to find your apartment.
H2c: Have you tried wandering around? The layout is logical.
H2d: But it would help to know where you were.
H2e: Luckily there are signs to help.
H2f: Nanci's opinion on the signs is useful.
H2g: Have you noticed the other citizens? They have ID tags.
H2h: And so do you.
H2i: Try moving and seeing how the tag numbers correspond to the
     street intersections, sublevel and door numbers.
H2j: The first letter corresponds to the sublevel: (D)esert,
     (F)orest, (Ice), (M)ountain, (O)cean or (S)pace. Try moving
     up or down.
H2k: The second letter and first two numbers correspond to the
     street interection. Change the letter by moving north or
     south, and the number by moving east or west.
H2l: The last two numbers help identify the door.


Q3: I think I've found my apartment door. How do I get in?

H3a: Have you examined the door?
H3b: Palmprints were scanned before arrival.
H3c: You can press the pad to get the door open.


Q4: I'm in my apartment. What now?

H4a: Try looking around.
H4b: At everything.
H4c: The storage drawer is a good starting place.


Q5: Is there anything useful in the citizen's guidebook?

H5a: Have you tried examining it?
H5b: Reading it?
H5c: Looking at the sections?
H5d: All the sections contain crucial information.


Q6: What's the cashcard for?

H6a: Nothing groundbreaking.
H6b: It's for paying with. You'll need it soon enough.


Q7: What's the digital wristwatch for?

H7a: Telling the time.
H7b: Not working? Try wearing it.
H7c: Timing is crucial for certain events.
H7d: The watch has another interesting feature...
H7e: ...which you'll learn by examining it.
H7f: The water provides light in the dark.
H7g: This will help and hinder you as the game progresses.
H7h: And like the bodysuit, you can't remove the watch.


Q8: What's the cryobed for?

H8a: Have you examined the cryobed?
H8b: It's for sleeping in, but you'll need to set a time first.
H8c: Find and wear the wristwatch first.
H8d: Now you can sleep until a desired time of day.
H8e: Using the cryobed has no adverse effect.
H8f: And it's the quickest way to pass time.


Q9: Is there anything special about the cryobed?

H9a: Have you tried switching it on without getting inside?
H9b: It's a real pain to have to wait for it to deactivate.
H9c: So there must be a shutoff feature.
H9d: Examine the bed closely.
H9e: It's on elevated legs which means...
H9f: ...there's a space underneath.
H9g: Try looking under the bed. There's the stop button.


Q10: I can't get off level 18!

H10a: Have you tried returning to the transporter tube?
H10b: You can't go anywhere interesting.
H10c: The guidebook has some important information.
H10d: You need to advance to inductee status.
H10e: And that requires a working guidebot.


Q11: How do I open the guidebot's access panel?

H11a: Have you examined the guidebot?
H11b: Looks like you need a wrench.
H11c: Except there isn't one in the game.
H11d: You've already got the tool you need.
H11e: But you may not know it yet.
H11f: You need to discover the purpose of the inhaler...
H11g: ...and find out more about what's inside.
H11h: The hints for level 35 will help you do this.
h11i: After that, the next step is simple?


Q12: What's the fried component?

H12a: Have you examined it?
H12b: Nanci's very technical minded.
H12c: The item is a burned out power cell.
H12d: And you need to replace it.
H12e: The fried component itself is useless.


Q13: What's the purpose of the octagonal interface port?

H13a: Have you tried inserting the morphtool?
H13b: That doesn't work here.
H13c: The port is no use for repairing the guidebot...
H13d: ...but it will be useful later.
H13e: Don't continue until you've repaired the guidebot.
H13f: And visited the free market on level 13.
H13g: There's something there that would fit.
H13h: It's an interface for the octagonal headed cyberjack
      (found in Pete's Swapshop).


Q14: I need a spare power cell. Where do I find one?

H14a: There's one in your apartment.
H14b: Try looking around.
H14c: Something in there has power beside the cryobed.
H14d: Have you tried switching off the light?
H14e: You'll need to find an alternate source of illumination.
H14f: Try reading the hints for the storage drawer items.
H14g: When you're wearing the wristwatch, you can remove the
      bulb when the light is switched off.


Q15: How do I get the power cell from the light bulb?

H15a: Have you tried being forceful?
H15b: Nanci's opinion is useful, so focus on the bulb.
H15c: An extreme change in conditions would weaken the glass.
H15d: Is there any way you could do that?
H15e: Something extremely cold?
H15f: Put the bulb in the cryobed and set the bed to a future time.
H15g: But the cryobed warms up steadily, so the change in conditions isn't
      sudden enough.
H15h: An emergency stop would do it.
H15i: If you haven't found the stop button, see the hints for Q9 above.
H15j: Press the button with the bulb inside the active cryobed.
H15k: Now the lightbulb is weak enough to break.


Q16: How do I repair the guidebot?

H16a: You need to get the access panel open.
H16b: Remove the bad part and insert a replacement.
H16c: The hints on how to do these things are above.


Q17: The guidebot is active. What now?

H17a: Did you listen to the guidebot?
H17b: Your suit jewels changed colour.
H17c: Meaning five new levels are open to exploration.
H17d: Namely the other residential levels (16, 17, 19 and 20) and the
      free market (level 13). Hints for these areas are given elsewhere.


LEVEL 19 - LUXURY APARTMENTS
----------------------------

Q1: I can't go anywhere on level 19.

H1a: Do you class yourself as a luxury?
H1b: Utopia Technologies don't.
H1c: Unless you have reason to visit the luxury apartments, you can't.
H1d: And you won't have a reason until late in the game.
H1e: When you reach class one citizen status, this level can be explored
     further.


Q2: What are the statues for at Lucy Song's estate?

H2a: Have you looked at them?
H2b: They're lights for the garden. And they'll save your life later on.
H2c: And they're voice activated.
H2d: So you need to figure out the words to turn them on.
H2e: What do the statues represent?
H2f: Lucy Song likes ordering her team mates around.
H2g: Try saying the names of Utopia Freedom players.
H2h: Their first names.
H2i: There are ten in total - the same names as the subbuteo pieces.


Q3: Does Lucy Song have a safe?

H3a: Yes she does.
H3b: And you'll need to get into it.
H3c: The safe is in Lucy's trophy room.
H3d: Have you looked at the memorial stand?
H3e: There's a sensor, and the correct object is the 'key'.


Q4: What's missing in the trophy room?

H4a: Some modesty perhaps.
H4b: And an item for the memorial stand.
H4c: Something to symbolise the Chinese women's soccer team.
H4d: If you haven't found the UTN news article, try solving this later.
H4e: The symbol of the team is a steel rose.
H4f: You can find one among other roses.
H4g: And where somebody sculpts steel.
H4h: It's in the retirement home.
H4i: Try searching the flowers in the arboretum.


Q5: What should I do with the subbuteo table?

H5a: Play with it.
H5b: No time for games? Try examining the table.
H5c: The items that go on it should be obvious.
H5d: You need to place the pieces in their correct positions.
H5e: Do that and Lucy Song will have a message for you.


Q6: How many subbuteo pieces are there?

H6a: How many players are there on a soccer team?
H6b: Don't forget to include the coach too.
H6c: Alternatively, look at the subbuteo table.
H6d: There are twelve spaces, so you need twelve pieces.


Q7: Where do I find all the subbuteo pieces?

H7a: Lucy Song gave most of them away.
H7b: Quite a few ended up with her resistance contacts.
H7c: Utopia Freedom supporters often have one.
H7d: Others you'll have seen already in your travels.
H7e: Do you really want to know where they all are?
H7f: Here is a list of pieces and locations (alphabetical order) with
     level in parantheses.
     See hints for the appropriate level if you're stuck finding or
     acquiring one.

  Rachel Baker		- Zacharias' safety deposit box (32)
  Monika Berlin 	- collection plate, Holy Citadel (24)
  Wendi Miranda Donahue - Old Bruce (20)
  Anya Kaparov		- student in Chill Zone (25)

  Lucy Song		- Lucy Song's safe (19)
  Ehizoge Symons	- school trophy cabinet (20)


Q8: I have all the subbuteo pieces. Where exactly do they go?

H8a: There are three separate clues to help.
H8b: You should have found one with the Rachel Baker piece.
H8c: And received another when you got the piece from Old Bruce.
H8d: Following up on this will get you a third (and most important) clue.
H8e: Wendi Miranda Donahue wrote a book.
H8f: Where do you find books?
H8g: Get the book from the library and read it. The UTN news article will help.
H8h: Wendi Miranda Donahue was the coach, so put her on the C position.
H8i: Information from the message cube and UTN news article is vital.
H8j: Place the numbers you know first, starting with numbers 7, 8 and 9.
H8k: The rest can be deduced. Remember Zacharias had numbers 4 and 5.
H8l: Are you still stuck?
H8m: Here is the lineup:

  Wendi Miranda Donahue (C)	Anya Kaparov (6)
  Monika Berlin (1)		Janie Rourke (7)
  Zara McCoy (2)		Sian O'Hara (8)
  Ehizoge Symons(3)		Lucy Song (9)
  Kelly Price (4)		Natalia (10)
  Rachel Baker (5)		Tania Rourke (11)


Q9: I know Lucy Song's secret. What next?

H9a: There's a bomb about to explode.
H9b: And you know where it is.
H9c: A million will die if you don't do something.
H9d: What are you standing around for?
H9e: Unfortunately, things aren't quite that simple.


Q10: Help! I'm drowning!

H10a: You need to escape obviously.
H10b: Taken by surprise, your air supply is limited.
H10c: You need to get more oxygen...
H10d: ...and find a way out of the pool.
H10e: See the hints below.


Q11: How do I get extra air underwater?

H11a: There are no oxygen tanks.
H11b: And you can't breathe underwater.
H11c: But Pearl Crocodile can.
H11d: Is their any way to tap her air supply?
H11e: Your life's at stake! Anything goes.
H11f: Kiss Pearl to suck the air from her mouth.
H11g: This will only work once. 


Q12: How do I escape from Pearl Crocodile?

H12a: You need to weaken her grip.
H12b: Struggling won't help.
H12c: Look around.
H12d: Especially at the body in the net.
H12e: And what Pearl's carrying.
H12f: She's concentrating on drowing you, so grab the harpoon.
H12g: Pearl won't let you use it against her.
H12h: But you could target something else. You need to be quick.
H12i: Have you looked at the body?
H12j: There's a weapon you can pick up if you get close enough.
H12k: The harpoon has a cable and winch.
H12l: Not scared of a little blood are you?
H12m: Shoot the body with the harpoon.
H12n: Then get the pistol and use it on Pearl.


Q13: I got out of the pool but Pearl Crocodile is still after me!

H13a: Maybe it's a good idea to run.
H13b: Then again, maybe not.
H13c: She'll soon recover. Get rid of her.
H13d: Look around for something to use.
H13e: Something you didn't have earlier.
H13f: Have you examined the wheelchair?
H13g: Those wires could be nasty if they were exposed.
H13h: Pull the wires.
H13i: You have a power source, so use it.
H13j: Push the wheelchair into the swimming pool.


Q14: I'm under attack from an invisible woman!

H14a: Remember the incident in the holding cell?
H14b: The invisible woman is Crystal Mole.
H14c: You need to avoid her attacks and find some means to see her.
H14d: More hints are below.


Q15: How do I avoid Crystal Mole?

H15a: She'll spend some time toying with you.
H15b: Eventually Crystal will attack.
H15c: You can't see her... yet.
H15d: But there's another way to find out where she is.
H15e: You can hear footsteps.
H15f: Listen and you'll know which direction she's coming from.
H15g: Attack in that direction and you'll hit her.
H15h: This strategy won't work forever, but it will buy you time.


Q16: How can I see Crystal Mole?

H16a: She's invisible.
H16b: But her optical camouflage isn't perfect.
H16c: If there was enough light you could see a distortion.
H16d: You may have already turned on a light here.
H16e: To get enough light, you need to activate all ten statues.
H16f: See the hints for Q2 if you're stuck.


Q17: I've made Crystal Mole visible. Now what?

H17a: For the first time you're on equal terms.
H17b: Don't squander your opportunity.
H17c: Take her out. A simple attack will do the job.
H17d: Having dealt with the two executives, you can continue.


Q18: Time's running out. How do I get to the stadium?

H18a: Have you tried leaving the estate?
H18b: The USF are after you. For some reason they're not concerned
      -- or don't know -- about the bomb.
H18c: Sneaking past them is difficult...
H18d: ...unless you were invisible.
H18e: You can take the optical camouflage from Crystal Mole.
H18f: Wear it and you can dodge the guards.
H18g: The stadium's on level 30.


LEVEL 20 - RETIREMENT HOME
--------------------------

Q1: What's the objective here?

H1a: Exploration to start with.
H1b: Eventually you'll get a task to complete.
H1c: You have to visit this level more than once.


Q2: How do I get inside outside visiting hours?

H2a: There's no way in when the barrier is closed.
H2b: Honestly. You'll have to come back some other time.


Q3: What's with the receptionists?

H3a: Their job is to provide information.
H3b: Notice the they -- there are two of them.
H3c: They can answer questions you have about the retirement home.
H3d: The key they're guarding seems important, doesn't it?
H3e: Knowing what happens around midday will be crucial later.


Q4: How do I get the sculpture from the activity area?

H4a: That's Old Bruce's pride and joy.
H4b: He won't let you take it.
H4c: Unless you have a good reason.
H4d: You need to get Old Bruce to cooperate.


Q4: Old Bruce keeps grumbling.

H4a: Have you listened to what he says?
H4b: Try asking the receptionist about Old Bruce.
H4c: You need to pay attention to Old Bruce... or listen.


Q5: What's the point of completing Old Bruce's task?

H5a: Don't you want to help an old man?
H5b: He'll reward you...
H5c: ...with a valuable item you need.
H5d: So find a way to get the sculpture to the plinth.


Q6: I can't get past the wrought iron gate in the arboretum.

H6a: It's locked.
H6b: You've already seen the key. The receptionist will confirm 
     it unlocks the gate.
H6c: But you can't get it without an item from beyond the gate.
H6d: Sounds like a paradox...
H6e: ...but there's another way past the gate.
H6f: Try examining the gate for a subtle clue.
H6g: You can climb over the gate.


Q7: I can't get the steel sculpture through the gate.

H7a: Climbing doesn't work if you're holding something heavy.
H7b: For this you do need the key.
H7c: An item from the flooded garden will help.
H7d: See the hints below.


Q8: Is there anything of interest in the flooded garden?

H8a: There's a collapsed walkway.
H8b: And two other items of interest.
H8c: Both in the same place.
H8d: Most stuff here is flooded.
H8e: You solved a similar problem in the registration area.
H8f: Search the water. 
H8g: Twice.
H8h: You can't use the cable right away, but you'll need it later.


Q9: What's the magnetic gun for?

H9a: Careful around USF troops. That's an illegal item.
H9b: It only works on magnetic things - iron, steel, cobalt etc.
H9c: Have you tried it on the gate?
H9d: What about the prongkey?
H9e: Neither of those is the solution.
H9f: There's something else made of metal in the home.
H9g: Look around the lobby.
H9h: The grandfather clock has an iron pendulum.
H9i: So shoot it. Those extra two minutes are crucial.


Q10: I've interfered with the grandfather clock. Now what?

H10a: The clock is two minutes fast.
H10b: Does anything time dependent happen in the lobby?
H10c: Have you read the shifts section of the citizen's guidebook?
H10d: Or been in the lobby at around 12:00?
H10e: A shift change occurs at noon.
H10f: And now the morning receptionist leaves two minutes early.
H10g: Giving you just enough time to grab the gate key and run off.


Q11: I can't carry the steel sculpture across the walkway.

H11a: The walkway's too slippery to cross with something so large.
H11b: If only you could raise it.
H11c: There's a cable in the same place you found the magnetic gun.
H11d: But you can't hold the cable and cross the walkway at the same time.
H11e: If there was something to support the cable...
H11f: ...or someone.
H11g: Old Bruce would help.
H11h: He's restricted to a wheelchair.
H11i: But it has wheels, so you can push him around.
H11j: Push Old Bruce to the flooded garden and give him the cable to hold.
H11k: You know what to do next: place the sculpture on the island's plinth.


Q12: What's the silver pyramid for?

H12a: Are you ungrateful?
H12b: It certainly looks valuable.
H13c: Have you been to the free market on level 13?
H13d: You can trade the pyramid for something at Pete's swapshop.
H13e: The pyramid has another use...
H13f: ...but you won't discover it until much later in the game.


Q13: I get captured and arrested in the flooded garden.

H13a: You're not supposed to be there.
H13b: Remember Old Bruce's warning.
H13c: Don't get caught after closing time.


Q14: Is there anything else of interest in the retirement home?

H14a: There's an item you may have missed.
H14b: You won't need it until much later on.
H14c: There's something in the arboretum.
H14d: Hidden in the flowers.
H14e: A painted steel rose.


Q15: Does Old Bruce have any more information?

H15a: Not immediately.
H15b: Much later on you'll get a hint he knows something important.
H15c: Don't continue unless you've found the message cube.
H15d: Seems Old Bruce knew Lucy Song.
H15e: And may have a subbuteo piece.
H15f: Have you tried asking Old Bruce about Lucy?
H15g: He'll deny knowing her unless you show him proof.
H15h: Play the message cube for him.
H15i: He'll give you a subbuteo piece...
H15j: ...and some valuable information.
H15k: What he says about Wendi's biography is important.
H15l: Finding that book could be a big help, so try the library.
H15m: Old Bruce will answer any questions about Lucy now too.


======================

H5c: Have you noticed how the boy copies you?
H5d: Is there any action you could perform that he'd copy and give you the key?

H10d: She's carrying a pen.
H10e: Notice anything familiar about the patterns of squares?
H10f: Gemma's standing on a crossword puzzle.
H10g: Have Gemma move around and explore the grid.
H10h: She needs to fill in the white squares. The questions are posted
      on the first square (across or down), and the letters go left to
      right (for across) or top to bottom (for down). Gemma can write
      individual letters on each square.
H10i: All the answers are common knowledge to Arcology Citizens.
H10j: Really -- you can figure them out.
H10k: The answers are:
	Utopian police abbreviation - USF

H12b: He's expecting you to do something.
H12c: Rescue the boy.


Q13: How do I deal with the school bully?

H13b: He'll soon realise he's met his match and do the coward's thing.
H13c: You need to stop him.
H13d: He's too quick to catch, so you need to slow him down.
H13e: Read the paragraph very carefully.

H15e: Throw the piece through the window.


Q16: I can't get my stuff back through the arched window!

H16a: This is very similar to another puzzle on this level.
H16b: Alice needs her hands free to climb up.
H16c: Is there any way to get the stuff inside before going through?
H16d: Throw the stuff through the arched window.


LEVEL 22 - GREAT LIBRARY OF UTOPIA
----------------------------------

Q1: What book do I ask the droid for?

H1a: Books are catalogued by surname and title.
H1b: Unless you know any last names, you won't find anything.
H1c: There are two books you can find.
H1d: Don't bother trying unless you've found the message on Level 16.
H1e: Remember the message? All the twos - that was a hint to come to the library.
H1f: Remember the other part? Look for Zacharias.
H1g: Ask the droid to find Zacharias - you'll get a book.


Q2: I keep dying when opening Zacharias' book. What do I do?

H2a: Try reading the cover.
H2b: Do you see anything important before you die?
H2c: The cover mentions time being critical - and it is.
H2d: You need to open the book at a certain time.
H2e: The message of level 16 is the clue here.
H2f: What time is all the twos?
H2g: Open the book at 22:22


Q3: What are the yellow contact lenses for?

H3a: Have you read the description?
H3b: Have you focused on them to get Nanci's verdict?
H3c: The lenses store retinal data and can be used to bypass a scanner.
H3d: They're also illegal, so use the inhaler to transport them between levels.


Q4: What about the second book?

H4a: The second book becomes available much later.
H4b: If you're not a purple (class one) citizen, you don't need it yet.
H4c: If you haven't found the message cube, don't continue.
H4d: If you haven't spoken to Old Bruce, do so.
H4e: He mentioned a name and a biography - follow up on it.
H4f: The second author is Wendi Miranda Donahue. 


Q5: What is the purpose of the reading room?

H5a: It should be self-explanatory.
H5b: Reading. Room. What do those words imply?
H5c: It's for reading library books - and is the only place you can do so.
 

LEVEL 23 - MUSEUM OF UTOPIAN ACHIEVEMENT
----------------------------------------

Q1: How can I get past the USF troops west of the entrance?

H1a: They're quite adamant on not letting you past.
H1b: They'll only let you through with the Director's permission.
H1c: If you haven't met the Director in person, you can't get through.
H1d: When you have class one citizen status, you can go west. Until then, no.


Q2: How do I get the Janie Rourke subbuteo piece out of the exhibit hall?

H2a: Have you tried taking the piece out?
H2b: The guard doesn't seem that alert, does he?
H2c: But he can still hear the alarm, and see you with the piece.
H2d: He doesn't have much regard for the alarm system, so you could confuse him.
H2e: Have you tried putting something on the pedestal?
H2f: It'll need to be similar enough to fool the guard.
H2g: Only one item will work -- something that looks exactly the same.
     Another subbuteo piece, identical to Janie Rourke.
H2h: If you've far into the game and have found the UTN news article, you'll know
     a key fact about two players. But you can make a guess anyway.
H2i: Janie Rourke has a twin sister named Tania.
H2j: Don't carry on until you have the Tania Rourke piece. 
     It's somewhere in the school on level 21.
H2k: Put the Tania Rourke piece on the pedestal, hide the Janie piece, and you can leave.


Q3: I've got the subbuteo piece out of the hall, but can't take it out of the museum.

H3a: There's no way to fool this guard...
H3b: ...which means you'll have to deactivate the security.
H3c: You'll need to get past the USF troops (see Q1).
H3d: Examining and having Nanci analyse the museum security will help.
H3e: You need to remove the radiation from the Janie piece so it won't be detected.
H3f: And that means using the deradiator.


Q4: How do I work the deradiator?

H4a: What deradiator? It'll be obvious when you've find it.
H4b: Don't continue unless you've gotten past the USF troops (see Q1).
H4c: Reading the instruction manual is always useful.
     Or in this case, the sign.
H4d: You need to know the donator and the year of donation.
H4e: Who's been giving away subbuteo pieces recently?
H4f: If you've found the subbuteo table or message cube, you'll know the answer.
H4g: Lucy Song was the donator, so the initials are LS.
H4h: She's been giving the items away recently, so you can assume it's the current year.
H4i: The year was mentioned on the terminal early on. And the calendar.
H4j: The current year is 2165.
H4k: Set the rings to LS2165, put the piece on the deradiator and activate it.
H4l: Now you should be able to safely remove it from the museum.


Q5: What's the purpose of the time capsule?

H5a: It's a ride, so get in.
H5b: It provides useful historical background...
H5c: ...and something very interesting in the last room (the archipelago).
H5d: If you haven't helped the student in the cafeteria on level 25, you may
     not realise its significance.
H5e: The Arcology will do for one of his photos.
H5f: Unfortunately you can't take photos from inside the time capsule.
H5g: See the hints for Q7 below.


Q6: How do I get through the emergency exit?

H6a: If you're on the wrong side you can't open it.
H6b: It's an exit so there must be an entrance.
H6c: You'll be able to open it from the other side.


Q7: Is there any more I can do with the time capsule?

H7a: There's not much you can do from inside.
H7b: You need to get out. Is there a safe area to do that?
H7c: Try jumping into the water in San Francisco.
H7d: Ah, the safety harness...
H7e: You can't unlock the harness when it's closed.
H7f: So you need to prevent it locking in place.
H7g: Have you examined the harness?
H7h: If you could block the buckle...
H7i: Put something small in the buckle before you set off. You
     can get the item back later.


Q8: What should I do in San Francisco?

H8a: There's not much you can do from the air.
H8b: See the above hints if you want to escape the capsule.
H8c: There's something new you can see from the water.
H8d: A vent in the west wall. You need to reach it, which involves
     solving a few problems first.


Q9: There's not much to see in San Francisco.

H9a: There's Coit Tower...
H9b: ...and the maglev rail. And the ocean.
H9c: Most of San Francisco is underwater.
H9d: Try diving. 
H9e: That valve looks useful. Turn it to lower the water level.


Q10: I've found the bridge. What now?

H10a: You're not here for sightseeing.
H11b: That cable could prove useful.
H11c: Do you care for Utopia or history?
H11d: Break the bridge to get a useful item.
H11e: That won't help by itself.
H11f: And don't stop there.
H11g: Break it again.


Q11: How do I reach the vent in the west wall?

H11a: Don't continue unless you've lowered the water level.
H11b: And got two useful items.
H11c: Have you tried throwing the cable at the vent?
H11d: If you had something to tie the cable to, it might catch.
H11e: Like the support pillar.
H11f: Looks like that's not the answer.
H11g: Is there something better to hook on to?
H11h: Try throwing the cable and pillar at the maglev rail.
H11i: Now you have a cable to climb.
H11j: Can't reach it? How can you get closer?
H11k: Turn the water valve and try again.
H11l: You can't go up... or west.
H11m: You need to gain some momentum. Is there anything around you
      could push off?
H11n: Kick Coit Tower and then go through the vent.


Q12: I keep on dying in the Colombian trenches!

H12a: Apparently Utopia used real poison gas.
H12b: Looking before you leap is a good idea.
      Try examining the soldiers and the trenches from the time capsule.
H12c: Or if you didn't, have a good feel around.
H12d: The soldiers must have survived the gas somehow.
H12e: You'll need to be specific when searching.
H12f: Feel their heads. Or take a gas mask if you know about it.
H12g: Now you can breathe down here.


Q13: How do I clear the smoke?

H13a: That'd be helpful wouldn't it?
H13b: Unfortunately you can't.
H13c: You can't see a thing, so rely on your other senses.


Q14: Where do I go in the trenches?

H14a: Did you look at the trenches before jumping in?
H14b: It's a bit of a maze, but a very small one.
H14c: The entrance is in the southeast, the exit in the northeast.
H14d: Move around and make a mental or written note where the walls are.
H14e: The maze is a five by five grid with no complications -- going 
      west then east will get you back where you started etc.
H14f: You can only move in the major compass directions.
H14g: If you're still stuck, go W W W N N E N N W W W from the entrance.


Q15: So what was the point of all that?

H14a: Reaching the Arcology, naturally.
H14b: And the other side of the fire exit. Now you can come back anytime.
H14c: Go help the student in the cafeteria on level 25 if you haven't done so.
H14d: He needs a photo of the arcology for his portfolio.


LEVEL 24 - HOLY CITADEL
-----------------------

Q1: What are the Tenets of Utopia for?

H1a: Reading.
H1b: Really. They'll save your life some day (very soon, in fact).
H1c: You'll need to learn the lines.


Q2: How do I get into the Citadel?

H2a: Have you read the note on the door?
H2b: You'll have plenty of opportunities.
H2c: Be there on the stroke of the hour.


Q3: I keep getting killed during the ceremony!

H3a: Ruby is eagle eyed and will spot anything out of place.
H3b: You can't hide -- at least not while she's watching.
H3c: What does the minister say?
H3d: They're reciting the tenets.
H3e: He starts you off so...
H3f: ...you need to finish them.
H3g: The Tenets of Utopia are posted outside the Citadel.
H3h: In response to the first line, say they were unworthy  
H3i: Then in turn:   They shall all perish
                     For we are superior
                     He is our saviour
                     Long live the director


Q4: What should I do with the collection plate?

H4a: What would you normally do?
H4b: Taking the subbuteo piece with Ruby watching is a bad idea.
H4c: You need to donate something.
H4d: Any item will do, but getting it back could be problematic.
H4e: Best put something useless on the plate, like the fried component.
H4f: Or the cashcard (now useless) 
     or another subbuteo piece (not needed for a while).
H4g: You'll get the chance to get the item back (and the Monika Berlin piece) later.


Q5: I'm still getting killed in the ceremony!

H5a: What did you do last time?
H5b: That won't help since you don't know the words.
H5c: Nanci's comment provides a subtle clue.
H5d: You need to hide.
H5e: The citizens are about to bow. There's your opportunity.
H5f: Ducking won't work, since you'll still be in sight of the citizens.
H5g: Is there anything you could do while ducked you couldn't before?
H5h: Take a look at what's around? Any hiding places?
H5i: Hide under one of the pews.


Q6: What's the statue of the Director for?

H6a: For information and looking at what a great man he is.
H6b: Have you spoken to the student on level 25?
H6c: Have you helped him with his problem?
H6d: He needs a picture of the Director.
H6e: Unfortunately you can't get it during the ceremony.
H6f: Concentrate on surviving then deal with this later.


Q7: The statue disappeared! How do I get it back?

H7a: The statue only officially comes up during the ceremony.
H7b: Remember what the minister was doing before the statue raised?
H7c: Remember what he said? Focusing on the statue and Bible might help.
H7d: Cometh the year, cometh the day, cometh the moment.
H7e: Have you looked at the bible?
H7f: You need to turn it to three specific places.
H7g: The clues are on the door outside. If you need to get of the hall,
     check the appropriate hint below.
H7h: The Director was born on the extra day at a quarter to four in the
     afternoon in the year 1916.
H7i: Start with the year, so turn the bible to 19:16
H7j: What's the extra day? It comes every four years.
H7k: You'll need to enter it in American format, putting the month first.
H7l: In a leap year, the extra day is February 29th, so turn the bible 
     to 2:29.
H7m: Then the moment. Use military time format.
H7n: The time is 15:45.


Q8: What should I do with the minister?

H8a: Nothing unless you want to.
H8b: He may be worth following.
H8c: You'll need to hide in the room or leave before he goes to bed.
H8d: Hiding may give you an extra clue.
H8e: If you're not carrying anything, you can get on the chandelier.


Q9: How do I get the items on the collection plate?

H9a: Have you tried taking them?
H9b: You'll need to deactivate the forcefield.
H9c: The stained glass window is the answer.
H9d: Do those women remind you of anybody? You've met at least one by now
     and heard of another.
H9e: The animals and colours are important.
H9f: There are six women, so you need to press six animals.
H9g: If you're quick and hide, you can see the last animal the minister pushes.
H9h: This puzzle is easier to solve later when you know the executives better.
H9i: Some you won't have met the first time you're in the citadel, and you'll 
     get more opportunities to meet them later.
H9j: The women have distinctive features, so try to remember which one is which.
H9k: The first woman was the executive in the tetrahedron -- Ruby Eagle.
H9l: So start by pushing the red eagle.
H9m: From left to right, the women are Ruby Eagle, Jet Scorpion, Crystal Mole,
     Ivory Worm, Amber Bear and Pearl Crocodile.
H9n: The symbols you need to push are: red eagle, black scorpion, clear mole,
        white worm, orange bear and grey crocodile.


Q10: How do I get out of the citadel?

H10a: You used the same solution to another problem.
H10b: If the citizens and minister return, they'll see you.
H10c: Hide under a pew again.
H10d: You can come in and out as often as you need to, and
      don't have to repeat the ceremony.


Q11: I keep getting discovered by the minister!

H11a: Don't let him see you.
H11b: See the hints to Q10 if you haven't already.
H11c: If he notices something out of place, he'll raise the alarm.
H11d: The Director's statue is very large. If it's still up, turn the bible to
      a random page to lower it.
H11e: Also, don't leave anything lying around.



LEVEL 25 - UNIVERSITY OF UTOPIA
-------------------------------

Q1: Where do I go on campus?

H1a: Have you looked around?
H1b: Have you seen the holomap?
H1c: Depending on where you've been, maybe that's not much help.
H1d: There's somewhere much closer and in immediate sight.
H1e: The cafeteria.
H1f: It's open during the evening shift (18:00-24:00).


Q2: How can I help the student in the Chill Zone?

H2a: Have you tried listening to him?
H2b: Try asking him about the computer.
H2c: Follow up questions can give you valuable information.
H2d: Have you looked at the computer?
H2e: A copper circle. Have you seen something like it before?
H2f: It requires a cyberjack, but the one you have is no good.
H2g: Hanging around the student long enough might help.
H2h: He has the cyberjack, but it won't work for him.
H2i: Ask the student for the circular headed cyberjack.
H2j: Well -- what are you waiting for? Jack in.


Q3: What should I do about the dragon?

H3a: Have you tried defending yourself?
H3b: Looks like that's not an option...
H3c: You can't do anything about it the first time...
H3d: ...but you need to get rid of the problem.
H3e: Notice what the student says when you exit.
H3f: He's interested in what happened.
H3g: So tell him about the dragon.
H3h: Next time you log on, you'll be better equipped.
H3i: Try looking at your inventory in cyberspace.
H3j: It's a throwing star, so throw it. Bye bye dragon.


Q4: How do I unscramble the text?

H4a: Have you tried reading the text?
H4b: Have you tried turning the spinners? Both of them?
H4c: They need to be set to specific letters.
H4d: Whenever you turn the white spinner, the text changes,
     replacing the yellow spinner letters in the text.
H4e: This is a standard substitution cipher, with each letter of the
     alphabet being replaced by another. If a letter occurs more than
     once, the substitution is the same each time.
H4f: Identifying likely words in the coded message helps.
H4g: Try talking to the student if you're stuck. Ask him some questions.
H4h: Does he mention a name? A signature?
H4i: Ivory Worm. That's at the end, so try changing the letters.
     With those in, a couple of more words can be guessed.
H4j: It's common to try putting THE or YOU in the text for unknown
     three letter words, so try that.
H4k: Remember where you are, and who Ivory Worm is.
H4l: The text is: 
     YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THE EXECUTIVE OF CYBERSPACE -- IVORY WORM


Q5: I've unscrambled the data. What now?

H5a: The student seems pleased, but he's got another problem.
H5b: He asked you a question.
H5c: Offer to help by saying yes. He'll give you a task and
     something to help.
H5d: This is the only way of getting class two citizenship.
H5e: You'll need a camera. You've probably seen one already.
H5f: There's a camera in Pete's Swapshop on Level 13.


Q6: Where do I find the photos?

H6a: First you'll need something to take the pictures with.
H6b: Got that? Good.
H6c: You can find a map, but not the real Director...
H6d: ...and you're already inside the arcology.
H6e: All the pictures can be found in the Education Levels.
H6f: Try exploring a little.
H6g: The Director's Statue is in the Citadel on Level 24.
H6h: The Arcology model will do -- that's on Level 23 in the museum.
H6i: See the hints for the appropriate level for these photos.
H6j: You can find a map on Level 25. Not the holomap, a different one.
H6k: You'll need to make contact in the Waterline Club first, so follow
     the hints from there. Read Q8 below if you're still stuck after that.


Q7: Does the student have anything else of value?

H7a: Have you seen what he's wearing?
H7b: Have you noticed a series of similar items around?
H7c: Try asking the student about the Freedom.
H7d: He has a subbuteo piece of Anya Kaparov.
H7e: He'll only give it to you after you've helped.
H7f: Fix the computer, get the photos and then ask him for the piece.


Q8: Is there anywhere else to go on campus?

H8a: There's the cafeteria for a start.
H8b: Besides that? It's too easy to get lost without a map.
H8c: Fortunately you have one.
H8d: If you have a particular department in mind, you can find it.
H8e: Don't continue unless you've found Professor Zacharias' book.
H8f: Seems like a useful man to find.
H8g: He's in the economics department, so look that up.
H8h: Head off to the south.


Q9: How do I get past the retinal scanner?

H9a: Have you tried looking in the scanner?
H9b: It was worth a shot. Presumably you have the book by Professor Z.
H9c: The key is opening the book.
H9d: Try reading the hints for the library on level 22 to do that.
H9e: The next step should be obvious.
H9f: Wear the lenses and look in the scanner.


Q10: What can I do in Professor Zacharias' office?

H10a: Not much to start with.
H10b: Try listening to the professor.
H10c: He won't let you touch anything in his office, so your options are limited.
H10d: But you can look around. See anything useful?
H10e: Look at the map more closely.
H10f: It shows the economy and Utopia corporations. Need that for anything?
H10g: Take a picture. It'll do for the student's portfolio.
H10h: You can't do anything more until you have class two citizen status.
H10i: And still not much more until you've completed Zacharias' tasks.


Q11: I've got class two citizen status. What now?

H11a: What did the professor say?
H11b: It might be worth a second visit.
H11c: In fact, it's essential.
H11d: The professor gives you a new task.
H11e: Notice he gave you a work permit. 
      Try visiting the other levels Zacharias mentioned.


Q12: When do I come back to see Zacharias?

H12a: Have you tried re-entering his office?
H12b: After visiting him as a class two citizen?
H12c: Seems he doesn't want to be disturbed.
H12d: Come back after you've finished the set tasks.
H12e: In fact, there'll be another reason for coming back later.


Q13: How do I avoid being captured by the executives?

H13a: You can't. Go to Zacharias' office after completing all his
      tasks and you'll be arrested.
H13b: Once you're captured, time becomes critical.
H13c: You may want to complete other miscellaneous tasks first.
H13d: But you'll need to get captured eventually.


Q14: Professor Zacharias is no longer in his office. What can I find?

H14a: The first time he's not there some rather nasty women are.
H14b: After that, you can take a look around.
H14c: Remember what Zacharias said before he died?
H14d: About breaking legs?
H14e: See any legs to break?
H14f: Break the two table legs - you'll find some useful items.


Q15: What's the pentagon headed cyberjack for?

H15a: For putting in a pentagon shaped hole, obviously.
H15b: It must be somewhere where Zacharias has access.
H15c: Remember the features of the other interface ports?
H15d: They were all copper rimmed. See any copper around?
H15e: Try looking at the map.
H15f: What to look for should be obvious, since you have the jack.
H15g: Look for a pentagon on the map -- there's your access port.


Q16: I'm in cyberspace. What are these pyramids for?

H16a: Have you looked at them all?
H16b: There are five in total.
H16c: One of them has extra information.
H16d: A number and a message.
H16e: There are four digits in the number, and five pyramids.
H16f: The purpose is more clear when you've been to level 32.
H16g: This is where Zacharias stored important information.
H16h: The pyramids are crucial to obtaining the security codes 
      for Zacharias' safety deposit box at the bank.


Q17: What does the message on the copper pyramid mean?

H17a: It says start with a number. That's the first security code.
H17b: The next part says go clockwise.
H17c: The order the pyramids come in is important.
H17d: And connecting to the order of the codes.
H17e: Starting there and going clockwise, the pyramids are copper,
      glass, sandstone, red and silver.


Q18: Some of these pyramids look familiar.

H18a: You've seen at least two already: silver and glass.
H18b: Out in the real world.


Q19: There's only one number in cyberspace. Where are the other
     four codes?

H19a: Zacharias wouldn't store them all in one place.
H19b: You'll need to look for the pyramids elsewhere.


Q20: Where's the glass pyramid (second) security code?

H20a: Look at the pyramid closely.
H20b: A woman on a motorcycle. Remember that?
H20c: The pyramid is the roof of the game zone.
H20d: There's only one room to search.
H20e: Any numbers on the videogame?
H20f: The code is hidden in the high score table.
H20g: The high score for Mother Nature is the second security code.


Q21: Where's the sandstone pyramid (third) security code?

H21a: Look at the pyramid closely.
H21b: It's a real place.
H21c: The base is a hint.
H21d: Seen anything that glows yellow?
H21e: Jack out of cyberspace and you'll be right next to it.
H21f: The code is hidden on the map in Zacharias' office.
H21g: See the hints at the end for more advice.


Q22: Where's the red pyramid (fourth) security code?

H22a: The pyramid looks unearthly doesn't it?
H22b: It's not on Earth.
H22c: Actually this one is on Mars...
H22d: ...in cyberspace.
H22e: Zacharias had an important item on him when he died.
H22f: Go to the morgue on level 31, get the ticket and follow
      the trail from there.


Q23: Where's the silver pyramid (fifth) security code?

H23a: You've already seen a silver pyramid...
H23b: ...but the code is usually invisible.
H23c: You need to retrieve the pyramid given to you by
      Old Bruce if you don't have it.
H23d: Notice the shaft of purple light.
H23e: That's telling you the pyramid needs to be in purple light.
H23f: There's only one place where the light is purple.
H23g: You may need to change the wavelength.
H23h: Go to the biodome on level 12, change the wavelength to 
      violet (380-449) and look at the pyramid again.
H23i: The number is the fifth security code.


Q24: Does the map in the office have a hidden purpose?

H24a: There are two important things about the map.
H24b: You'll need to be alone in the office to discover them.
H24c: Find the items in the office if you haven't already.
H24d: Look at the hints for Q15 first.
H24e: See the hints below.


Q25: How do I read the map?

H25a: Read the hints for Q16 if you haven't done so.
H25b: There's more to the map than an access port.
H25c: Notice how the map glows. You can make it brighter.
H25d: You can't control the map brightness but...
H25e: Turn off the desk lamp. That should brighten things up.
H25f: Notice anything about the map colour?
H25g: Try wearing the lenses then looking again.
H25h: There are grid references on the map.


Q26: What do I look for on the map?

H26a: You can look up specific places.
H26b: If you haven't visited the pentagon, don't read any further.
H26c: Remember the stone pyramid? It's a real place.
H26d: Find Giza -- the map reference is the third security code.


=======================
---RECREATION LEVELS---
=======================

GENERAL QUESTIONS
-----------------

Q1: How do I reach the recreation levels?

H1a: You need to gain access to the residential and education levels first.
H1b: After that, concentrate on getting class two citizen status.
H1c: The university on level 25 is a good place to start.


LEVEL 26 - TRAVEL AGENT
-----------------------

Q1: The conductor won't let me do anything!

H1a: You can't bargain with the robot.
H1b: Or destroy it.
H1c: Or outsmart it.
H1d: So you need a ticket.
H1e: You'll find one in plain sight later on...
H1f: ...when you have access to the administration levels.
H1g: It's in the morgue on level 31.


Q2: I got a ticket. Now what?

H2a: Hand it to the conductor.
H2b: The rest should be obvious.
H2c: Take a seat and enjoy the trip.


Q3: What is there to see on the red planet?

H3a: There are some nice canyons.
H3b: And a red pyramid.
H3c: Seen anything like it before?
H3d: You may want to check out Zacharias' office throughly.
H3e: Zacharias' fourth security code is hidden here.


Q4: Where is the security code hidden?

H4a: Have you examined everything in sight?
H4b: The pyramid?
H4c: The canyons?
H4d: The latter seems to have a pattern. Maybe if you had a better view.
H4e: Climb the pyramid and try looking at the canyons again.


Q5: I can't see the canyons because off the sun.

H5a: You need to shield your eyes.
H5b: Astronauts deal with this situation a lot.
H5c: There's a visor on your spacesuit.
H5d: And a control to lower it.
H5e: But your head is inflexible inside the helmet.
H5f: So you can't see the back and side.
H5g: You've had to find things you couldn't see before.
H5h: Feel the spacesuit then turn the knob.
H5i: Now look at the canyons from atop the pyramid.
H5j: The number you see is the fourth security code.


LEVEL 27 - UTOPIA STUDIOS 
-------------------------

Q1: The studio gates are locked.

H1a: Have you looked at the gates?
H1b: Tried forcing your way through?
H1c: There's no way inside the studios. Yet.
H1d: You'll need to come back later.
H1e: If you haven't done so, go see Professor Zacharias to 
     get additional instructions.
H1f: Visit the other two areas he mentioned.
H1g: The biodome is on level 12, and the casino on level 29.
H1h: Complete your missions there.
H1i: Then the studio gates will be open.


Q2: I'm going to be a movie star!

H2a: Good for you.
H2b: But it's only a B-vid.
H2c: And you're not here to enjoy yourself.
H2d: Like Nanci said, you'll only get one shot.
H2e: And you only have ten minutes to get ready.
H2f: So ditch what you're carrying and put on the costume.
H2g: Don't forget the holopistol.
H2h: You'll get your items back later.


Q3: What am I supposed to do with the script?

H3a: What do you think?
H3b: Examine it. Read it.
H3c: You need more specific information.
H3d: Remember what the producer said?
H3e: You're playing Chinese Soldier #143.
H3f: So try finding that part in the script.
H3g: It would be unprofessional to take the script with you.
H3h: You'll need to memorise the part.


Q4: I keep getting kicked off the movie set.

H4a: You do know what you're doing?
H4b: Read the script if you didn't.
H4c: And more than a cursory glance is required.
H4d: See the hints for Q3 if you haven't.
H4e: The rest is all about acting.
H4f: Everything Chinese Soldier #143 does is important.
H4g: You must perform the actions correctly, and in sequence.


Q5: What are my lines?

H5a: You have read the script?
H5b: Your specific part? See the hints for Q3 and Q4.
H5c: Your character doesn't say much. Only three words.
H5d: But there's a lot of action.
H5e: The first instruction is to shoot the zombies, so do that.
H5f: The weapon has already jammed, so the next step is...
H5g: Throw the gun at a zombie.
H5h: Next you have to say something.
H5i: Say I'm out.
H5j: Got the hang of it now? The rest is all action.
H5k: Climb onto a zombie, jump up and grab the gun.
H5l: Still struggling?
H5m: Shoot the zombie. Break the crawling zombie's neck.
H5n: All you have to do is scream. Then fall into the hole.
H5o: Whew!


Q6: I've done my bit. Now what?

H6a: They're still shooting the movie.
H6b: But you're not on camera any more.
H6c: You need to find a way backstage.
H6d: Dressing up as a zombie may confuse the crew.
H6e: And there's one in the hole beside you.


Q7: Why's Nanci acting strange?

H7a: It does seem rather odd.
H7b: You have more important things to worry about now.
H7c: You'll find out why soon enough.


Q8: How do I get a zombie uniform?

H8a: Have you tried taking the one from the robot.
H8b: Colombian uniforms are a different colour to the Chinese.
H8c: So the one you're wearing is no good.
H8d: Unless you disguise it somehow.
H8e: Look at the Colombian uniform. Read the description.
H8f: It's covered in mud.
H8g: So take your uniform off, drop it in the mud, and put it back on.
H9h: Now your body looks like a zombie.


Q9: How do I get the zombie's mask?

H9a: That would be useful.
H9b: Have you tried taking the mask?
H9c: It might be easier to get if the zombie lost its head.
H9d: Fortunately you have the means to do that.
H9e: What happened on the movie set?
H9f: Try shooting the zombie's head.
H9g: Not working? Remember how holopistol's work.
H9h: The robots are light sensitive.
H9i: And this one's covered in mud.
H9j: Try cleaning its head first, then shoot it.
H9k: Now you can get the mask.


Q10: I'm wearing the uniform and mask, but keep getting caught.

H10a: Did you disguise the uniform? See the hints for Q8.
H10b: Read the text carefully.
H10c: Holding the pistol gives you away.
H10d: So drop the gun. It's useless.


Q11: I made it backstage to the prop room. Now what?

H11a: Did you hear what Nanci said?
H11b: That box looks important. Examine it.
H11c: You need a hexagonal headed cyberjack.
H11d: Luckily there's one around.
H11e: Search the storage shelves.


Q12: This looks like a trap to me.

H12a: Well spotted.
H12b: But sometimes you need to spring a trap.
H12c: So jack into the black box.


Q13: I'm in cyberspace. This place looks familiar.

H13a: It should. You've been there before.
H13b: Appears everything was a deception.
H13c: Ivory Worm has you in a trap. You need to escape.


Q14: How do I escape from cyberspace?

H14a: Have you tried jacking out?
H14b: It won't be that easy.
H14c: Listen to what Ivory says before the scenario restarts.
H14d: You need to find a bug in cyberspace.
H14e: Is there anything that could take place out of sequence?
H14f: Doing what you're supposed to won't help.
H14g: You need to change the order things happen.
H14h: Not much happens you can interact with.
H14i: The only actions involve the Nanci pill.
H14j: You're supposed to take it then eat it.
H14k: But who says you have to follow orders?
H14l: If you tried to eat the pill before taking it...
H14m: Remember you want things to be out of sequence.
H14n: So insist on doing it that way around.


Q15: I escaped Ivory Worm's trap. What now?

H15a: Aren't you angry?
H15b: Just a little.
H15c: You don't want to lose the element of surprise.
H15d: Attack Ivory Worm before she can react.


Q16: Where's Nanci gone?

H16a: Did you pay attention to what just happened?
H16b: Ivory Worm didn't lie.
H16c: Nanci's gone for good. You're on your own.


Q17: How do I get out of the prop room?

H17a: Have you tried leaving through the door?
H17b: You need a different strategy.
H17c: There's no way to avoid being found.
H17d: If the crew man sees Ivory's body, it won't be good.
H17e: You need to hide her.
H17f: How did you conceal yourself?
H17g: Dress Ivory up as a zombie. Put the uniform and mask on her.
H17h: But she still looks suspicious lying on the floor.
H17i: Move her body to where the other robots are.
H17j: Drag Ivory Worm onto the shelf.


Q18: How do I get back into the film studio?

H18a: You were lucky to escape before.
H18b: And you got all your stuff back.
H18c: There's no need for a second visit.


Q19: I've done everything here. Where do I go next?

H19a: Ivory Worm's revelations were startling.
H19b: You're not the only one in danger.
H19c: Better check on Professor Zacharias.
H19d: Be warned. Timing is about to get critical.


LEVEL 28 - GAME ZONE
--------------------

Q1: I can't go anywhere on level 28.

H1a: Utopia likes its rules and procedures.
H1b: You need a permit to play games.
H1c: You'll get one when you need it.
H1d: Ironically you'll need to play and win games to get it.
H1e: A casino attendant on level 29 has a permit.
H1f: She'll give it to you after you beat the casino games.


Q2: I'm inside the game zone. What now?

H2a: Have you looked at the superbike?
H2b: You'd look cool riding that.
H2c: So get on and start the engine.


Q3: What happened to my score?

H3a: You're playing a game. Remember?
H3b: A game within a game.
H3c: While you're on the superbike, the score is the videogame score.


Q4: What's the maximum possible score on the videogame?

H4a: Lucy Song is a very good player.
H4b: She scored close to the maximum.
H4c: The maximum possible score is 4000 points.


Q5: How many points do I need to score in the videogame?

H5a: In a game it's advisable to score as many points as possible.
H5b: The woman in the casino gave some instructions.
H5c: You need 2000 points to see the manager.
H5d: But there's a bonus for scoring 4000.
H5e: A very important bonus.
H5f: You'll get a subbuteo piece.
H5g: Which you need to finish the game.
H5h: In other words, you need 4000 points.


Q6: This videogame is hard. How many tries do I get?

H6a: What makes you think there's a limit?
H6b: You play as often as you want.
H6c: And may have to in order to learn the best strategy.


Q7: Any general advice for playing the videogame?

H7a: Try it a few times to get a feel for it.
H7b: You gain points by causing destruction.
H7c: Do as much damage as possible.
H7d: Big explosions and stunts are a staple of the genre.
H7e: Pulling those off will earn you more points.


Q8: What should I do in the showroom?

H8a: Don't worry about the guards. They're poor shots.
H8b: This is an action game. Cause as much damage as possible.
H8c: Shooting those goons would be a start.
H8d: Did you examine the guards? There's a subtle hint.
H8e: Drive into the guards and run them over for some more points.
H8f: Notice those motorbikes? Blow them up!


Q9: I've wrecked the showroom. How do I escape?

H9a: There's an obvious escape route if you look.
H9b: The windows here are breakable.
H9c: You're a superspy in a videogame...
H9d: ...which means stunts are the norm.
H9e: Drive through the window.


Q10: I'm being pursued by a helicopter on the roof!

H10a: You don't have time for gawping here.
H10b: You won't reach the door while you're under fire.
H10c: So find a way to gain more time.
H10d: If the helicopter pilot couldn't see so well, they might miss.
H10e: Most of the helicopter is armoured.
H10f: But the searchlight isn't, so shoot it.
H10g: You're about to crash into that door!
H10h: You need to target a specific weak point.
H10i: Shoot the lock off.


Q11: How do I avoid the guards in the stairwell?

H11a: It's a bottleneck.
H11b: Even low level goons are decent shots in tight spaces.
H11c: Unless they couldn't see you.
H11d: Try looking at what you see.
H11e: Dry ice makes white clouds.
H11f: Shoot the fire extinguishers.


Q12: I'm trapped in the stairwell and can't escape.

H12a: You need to even the odds. See the hints for Q11 first.
H12b: A shootout with the goons is a bad idea.
H12c: You could run them over.
H12d: That's not the best solution however.
H12e: Do what you do best. Blow something up.
H12f: Read the text about the guards carefully.
H12g: They're carrying something explosive.
H12h: Shoot the grenades.


Q13: I've got a sedan on my tail!

H13a: Don't worry. It'll lose you eventually.
H13b: You score points for getting rid of it though.
H13c: The vehicle is armoured.
H13d: Look for a weak spot.
H13e: Shoot the tires.


Q14: I've got motorbikes on my tail!

H14a: You can shoot them to earn a few points.
H14b: There's a better solution however.
H14c: Notice the tanker truck?
H14d: Look at it closely.
H14e: Shoot the valve to create an oil slick.


Q15: There's a roadblock ahead! What now?

H15a: Are you going to let it stop you?
H15b: Shoot something obviously.
H15c: Killing the snipers will get you some points.
H15d: But there's a better way to deal with them.
H15e: Notice what they're standing under.
H15f: Shoot the holoboard.
H15g: You could go around the truck...
H15h: ...but you're a superspy and do stunts.
H15i: Slide underneath the truck for extra points.


Q16: That helicopter is back!

H16a: This is the big boss. You can't get rid of it that easily.
H16b: You'll need to do something about those cannons.
H16c: What do you normally do?
H16d: Shoot the cannons.
H16e: The helicopter has a backup plan however.
H16f: Its missiles require you to be in sight.
H16g: Anywhere to hide?
H16h: Go underneath the awnings.


Q17: HOw do I destroy the helicopter?

H17a: Concentrate on avoiding it first. See the hints above.
H17b: A solution will present itself.
H17c: Notice that ramp? It's not there for show.
H17d: Ride on the ramp.
H17e: In the air? See anything to target?
H17f: Shoot the rotor blades.


Q18: Can I have a list of available points for the videogame?

H18a: Only look at this if you're totally stuck and the above hints
      don't help.
H18b: Still here?
H18c: Here's the list of points and actions you need for a maximum
      score of 4000.
        
        100  Shooting the showroom guards
        200  Running over showroom guards
        200  Destroying the showroom motorcycles
	300  Driving through showroom window
        250  Taking out the helicopter searchlight
         50  Shooting off the padlock
        100  Smoking the stairwell (shoot fire extinguishers)
        250  Shooting a fission grenade in the stairwell
        300  Shooting the sedan's tires
        400  Flooding the road with oil (shoot tanker valve)
        300  Shooting the holoboard
        400  Sliding underneath the truck
        300  Destroying the helicopter's cannons
        150  Driving under the awnings
        200  Driving up the ramp
        500  Shooting the helicopter rotor blades
             (and finishing the videogame)

      These are non-ideal solutions and won't earn you the maximum
      score.

    	100  Riding over the men in the stairwell
         25  Taking out a pursuing motorcycle (can be repeated)
        100  Destroying the oil tanker
        100  Shooting the roadblock snipers


Q19: I've beaten the videogame. Is there anything more to do here?

H19a: Do? No. Look at? Possibly.
H19b: Don't continue unless you've searched Zacharias' office.
H19c: And jacked into his cyberspace port.
H19d: The glass pyramid here resembles the one in the pentagon.
H19e: See any numbers around?
H19f: Try playing the game.
H19g: Look at the high scores very carefully.
H19h: One of them is by Mother Nature. That's the second security code.


LEVEL 29 - FAME AND FORTUNE CASINO
----------------------------------

Q1: I don't like gambling.

H1a: You have little choice.
H1b: But you won't be playing for money.
H1c: Or spending anything.


Q2: How do I get upstairs?

H2a: Have you tried going up?
H2b: Did you listen to the attendant?
H2c: You need to prove yourself worthy.
H2d: There are three games you need to win.
H2e: Win the Lucky Dip, Wheel of Fate and the Lottery.
H2f: Don't worry about getting caught cheating. That's a good thing.


Q3: How do I win the Lucky Dip?

H3a: Have you tried playing.
H3b: Despite the name, you can't win through luck alone.
H3c: You need to know the number you pick in advance.
H3d: Have you looked at the balls?
H3e: The blue text?
H3f: Got anything you could substitute?
H3g: Your wristwatch would do the trick.
H3h: It only works when its really dark.
H3i: What provides light in the tank?
H3j: Any way you could cover the lamp up? You don't have much.
H3k: Cover the lamp with a metal ball. Then show the woman the watch.
H3l: Give the attendant a number to match the time you'll show her.
H3m: Timing is crucial here. Try again if you don't get it.
H3n: And the balls are numbered 1 to 800 so you can only do this
     before 08:00.


Q4: How do I win the Wheel of Fate?

H4a: Play it a couple of times to see what happens.
H4b: You can't rely on luck.
H4c: Have you tried deliberately turning the wheel to a gold segment?
H4d: You need to know how fast the wheel turns.
H4e: It moves too quickly to see.
H4f: Judgment is blind, like the attendant says.
H4g: The wheel's making a real racket.
H4h: Listen while the wheel is turning.
H4i: Now you can make it land on the gold segment.
H4j: But you'll need to be specific when you turn it.


Q5: How do I win the Utopian Lottery?

H5a: It's a real lottery.
H5b: But the odds are much better if you know the secret.
H5c: Have you tried saving, restoring and watching a draw again?
H5d: The numbers follow a set sequence.
H5e: But saving and restoring won't work because the attendant will 
     test you.
H5f: Watch several draws in a row and make a note of the numbers.
H5g: There's a pattern the numbers follow.
H5h: More specifically, three patterns.
H5i: Meagan in the arcade room has a hint. Ask her about the lottery.
H5j: One of the numbers is always prime.
H5k: That number follows the sequence of prime numbers between 1 and 50:
     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
H5l: One number is a multiple of 10, decreasing each time:
     50, 40, 30, 20, 10
H5m: The last number is a square number, increasing in sequence:
     1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49
H5n: None of the numbers overlap. At the end of each sequence the number
     starts again from the beginning.
H5o: Based on the last three lottery numbers, you can work out the next three.


Q6: Is Meagan good for anything?

H6a: You can ask her questions.
H6b: She won't help you with the mission in the casino.
H6c: Apart from giving a couple of hints.
H6d: She has something else you need.
H6e: Look at Meagan's clothes.
H6f: Ask her about the Freedom.
H6g: She has the Zara McCoy subbuteo piece.


Q7: How do I play the trivia game?

H7a: Have you examined the machine?
H7b: No tokens? You'll have to borrow one.
H7c: From someone close by.
H7d: Meagan has a lot of tokens to play with.
H7e: Try asking her for one.
H7f: You'll have to take her up on the offer.
H7g: Tell Meagan to put a token in the trivia machine.


Q8: Meagan always beats me! It's not fair.

H8a: The quiz questions are the same each time.
H8b: But four are chosen at random from a set of eight.
H8c: With practice you can get all four right.
H8d: But the best you can manage is a draw.
H8e: Unless you cheat somehow.
H8f: Look at the machine closely.
H8g: Not everything is on the front.
H8h: Pull the machine away from the wall. Now look again. 
     See anything familiar?
H8i: You can hack into the machine and mess with it.
H8j: But put it back before asking Meagan to play.


Q9: I hacked into the trivia machine. What should I do?

H9a: Did you examine the machine before jacking in? 
H9b: Note the button colours.
H9c: Have you played against Meagan?
H9d: These are the databanks of questions and answers.
H9e: You can change the answers so Meagan gets her questions wrong.
H9f: What do you normally do with soccer balls?
H9g: Kick the balls to change the answers to that colour.
H9h: You can change the answers to whatever you like.
H9i: It's probably easier to change them all to one colour.
H9j: That way you'll remember the change.
H9k: And Meagan is guaranteed to get a question wrong.


Q10: I've beaten all the games, but can't get into the manager's office.

H10a: You only need to beat Lucky Dip, Wheel of Fate and the Lottery.
H10b: Have you visited the woman again?
H10c: More hoops to jump through.
H10d: The permit is for the game zone on level 28.
H10e: Go there and score at least 2000 points, then come back.
H10f: Now you can go upstairs.
H10g: But can only see the manager once per day.


Q11: What's my objective in the manager's office?

H11a: You can't get information from him directly.
H11b: And he won't volunteer any.
H11c: Look around the office.
H11d: Notice the cyberjack interface port on the desk.
H11e: You need to jack in to get the information.


Q12: How do I distract the manager?

H12a: You have no choice here.
H12b: Have you tried distracting him? It's obvious what he wants.
H12c: A kiss might work.
H12d: Sounds like he's into rough stuff. And he likes tough girls.
H12e: Beat him up a little then try again.
H12f: Now he's distracted.


Q13: Where's the cyberjack for the cross shaped interface port?

H13a: He doesn't trust his security staff that much.
H13b: The manager has the cyberjack on him.
H13c: It's in his jacket.
H13d: You'll need to distract him first. See the hints for Q11.
H13e: Now you can get the cyberjack.
H13f: Just don't let the manager see you with it.


Q14: How do I reach the interface port without being seen?

H14a: It's difficult from the middle of the room.
H14b: You need to decide where to distract the manager.
H14c: He likes being pushed around.
H14d: So push him onto the desk first.
H14e: You'll need to keep him there.
H14f: Get on top of the manager... or the desk.


Q15: I'm in the manager's cyberspace room, but can't open the treasure chest.

H15a: Look at the chest.
H15b: You need something to put in those slots.
H15c: The items are nearby.
H15d: The playing cards will fit, but you need to choose specific ones.
H15e: Remember the manager's tastes.
H15f: He has a thing for black women.
H15g: The cards you need are the queen of clubs and queen of spades.
H15h: Put those cards in the slots, and the chest will open.


Q16: What should I do with the wealth of information?

H16a: It's in cyberspace.
H16b: You can't take the information with you.
H16c: But you do need to look at it.
H16d: That's all you can do.


Q17: I've got the information. How do I get back into the manager's office?

H17a: Why do you want to?
H17b: You have everything you need.
H17c: So there's no reason to go back.


Q18: I've completed my mission in the casino. What next?

H18a: Remember Zacharias' instructions... assuming you have them.
H18b: If you haven't been to the biodome on level 12, go there.
H18c: If you've already completed that task, the only place left is the film
      studio.
H18d: The gates are open now, so go to level 27.


LEVEL 30 - NEO WEMBLEY STADIUM
------------------------------

Q1: How do I get into the stadium?

H1a: It's off limits for most of the game.
H1b: Until the very end.
H1c: Don't continue until you've got class one citizen status.
H1d: And discovered Lucy Song's secret.
H1e: Now you can finally get inside.


Q2: I'm inside the stadium. What am I supposed to do here?

H2a: You know where the bomb is.
H2b: And you're invisible.
H2c: You can't do anything from the stands.
H2d: So go down to the pitch.


Q3: What's my strategy for stopping Lucy Song?

H3a: Lucy Song's hard to deal with while she's running around.
H3b: Getting her off the soccer field would help.
H3c: You're invisible so take advantage.
H3d: Push Lucy around. She'll retaliate and get dismissed.
H3e: Well? Go follow her down the tunnel.


Q4: How do I get past Amber Bear in the changing room?

H4a: For a minute to so, you're very dazed.
H4b: Concentrate on dodging her attacks first.
H4c: A high swing can be ducked.
H4d: And you can jump over the low swing.
H4e: Her third attack is unstoppable.
H4f: You need something to use against Amber.
H4g: There's not much to play around with.
H4h: Not with that bench in the way.
H4i: That's the only thing in reach.
H4j: Look at the bench after Amber's swung it once.
H4k: That splinter will have to do.
H4l: You can't get it until the bench is really damaged.
H4m: Amber Bear is out of attack range.
H4n: So you'll have to do something else.
H4o: Throw the splinter at Amber.


Q5: I've dealt with Amber. What about Jet Scorpion?

H5a: Jet has you in a stranglehold.
H5b: You can't deal with her alone.
H5c: There's someone else in the room.
H5d: That should be something.
H5e: Have you looked at Lucy's body and head?
H5f: She could operate her body remotely, if she had power.
H5g: There's a source of power nearby.
H5h: If you don't do something it'll be the death of you.
H5i: Jet's whip can be electrified.
H5j: Turn the whip on, but make sure you're holding the head first.


Q6: Lucy's helping me out with Jet. What's the plan?

H6a: Lucy Song gave you one.
H6b: Grab the decagonal headed cyberjack.
H6c: Then run.


Q7: I'm trapped on the arch. Should I make a deal with Gustav?

H7a: You can if you want.
H7b: But that's rather selfish.
H7c: And not the best of endings.
H7d: But you'll survive.


Q8: I don't want those people to die. What are my other options?

H8a: The plural is optimistic.
H8b: You do have one other choice.
H8c: Listen to Lucy Song.
H8d: She has an interface port to disable the fission core.
H8e: But you need a strong wind to move her hair.
H8f: And there's no breeze.
H8g: But you could create one.
H8h: Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
H8i: Jump.


Q9: Help! I'm falling!

H9a: You don't have much time.
H9b: Act quickly.
H9c: There's an interface port. And a cyberjack.
H9d: You should know what to do by now.
H9e: See the interface port on Lucy's head? Jack into it.


Q10: I'm in cyberspace. How do I disarm the fission core?

H10a: Obviously you need to cut the wires.
H10b: You need to cut all eight of them.
H10c: Naturally, they must be cut in the correct sequence.
H10d: Intuitively, each wire is only cut once.
H10e: Lucy Song gave you the sequence just now.
H10f: The eight things she mentioned refer to a wire.
H10g: From immigrant to class one citizen. That refers to 
      the jewel colours.
H10h: Steel Rose to Utopia Freedom. What colour is a rose?
      And what colour do the Freedom wear?
H10i: From newbie to golden girl. What's the colour for a newbie?
      And what colour is gold?
H10j: What colours represent evil and good? If you've worked out the
      others, there are only two wires left.
H10k: The correct sequence of wires is: 
      clear, purple, red, blue, green, yellow, black, white.


Q11: I diffused the core, but now I'm dying.

H11a: Those people are still alive.
H11b: Your mission is complete.
H11c: All you can do now is wait for the end.


Q12: Is there a better ending?

H12a: You could have given the head to Gustav. Not exactly better.
H12b: Death isn't necessarily a bad thing.
H12c: You're an inspiration. And others may follow you.
H12d: If you got maximum points, then you got the best ending.

H3b: Sort of. Have you examined the ticket?
H3c: It's for the travel agent on level 26.


Q4: What else can I get from Zacharias' body?

H4b: He has something you need... in a sense.
H4c: You'll have a better idea if you've visited level 32.

Q3: What do I need to access the deposit box?

H3a: Have you looked around?

H3e: Which is five separate four digit numbers.
H3f: Don't attempt to access the box until you have everything.


Q4: The yellow contact lenses don't work!

H4a: Of course not. Security is tighter here.
H4b: There's an inbuilt safety measure.
H4c: Which means only a real eye will work.


Q5: Where and how do I get Professor Zacharias' eye?

H5a: Remember what the professor said before he died?

H5c: The morgue's on level 31.
H5d: See the hints for that level if you're still stuck.


Q6: Where do I find the security code?

H6a: It's complicated.
H6b: But Zacharias stored it in a safe place in case something
     happened to him.

H6d: You need to access his cyberspace domain.
H6e: See the hints for level 25 and cyberspace for more information.

H8d: Know anybody called Bruce?
H8e: Remember the man in the retirement home?
H8f: Go to level 20 and ask Old Bruce about Lucy.

Q2: How do I escape from the containment field?

H2a: Have you examined it?

H2c: Talked to the people outside?
H2d: The Utopian cells are a secure facility.
H2e: The only way out is when they let you out.


Q3: How do I save Professor Zacharias?

H3a: You'd need to be outside the containment field.
H3b: Which is escape proof.
H3c: In other words, you can't.
H3d: But pay close attention to his dying words.


Q4: Where should I begin my search for Lucy Song?

H4a: You're a class one citizen now.

H1d: Are you a witness in a case?
H1e: Are you part of Utopia's justice system?
H1f: Have you received instructions to come here?
H1g: So what are you doing here?
H1h: There's nothing to see or do on level 34.


LEVEL 35 - REGISTRATION
-----------------------

Q1: I'm stuck on the landing pad.

H1a: Why not have a look around your new home?
H1b: At the laser fields?
H1c: And the not so friendly troops?
H1d: Follow up on Nanci's instruction.
H1e: He'll give you a prod if you wait long enough.
H1f: Focus on the troopers.
H1g: This is an important ability.


Q2: What can I focus on?

H2a: Most things in the game.
H2b: Nanci usually has a comment.
H2c: Sometimes not so helpful, but other times essential.
H2d: It's worth focusing on everything you come across.
H2e: Especially if it's techonology.


Q3: I'm in the waiting area, but nothing happens.

H3a: Something does happen shortly after you arrive.
H3b: Someone dropped something in the grate.
H3c: And you need that item.
H3d: The guards are busy processing and there's a lot of immigrants.
H3e: So go grab that thing.


Q4: I can't find the item the guard dropped.

H4a: You did examine the grate?
H4b: It's not much use closed.
H4c: Have you looked at the water?
H4d: You know there's something there.
H4e: If you can't see it...
H4f: Feel the water... or reach into it.
H4g: The antiviral inhaler will prove very useful.


Q5: What do I do at the registration terminal?

H5a: You're given precise instructions.
H5b: Which you need to follow.
H5c: Begin by inserting your visa.
H5d: But make sure you examine it first.


Q6: The machine's asked for a passport, but I don't have it.

H6a: Alice isn't stupid enough to come without one.
H6b: She has it with her.
H6c: Did you look at what you're carrying?
H6d: The jacket can be opened.
H6e: Your passport is in the inside pocket.
H6f: Follow Nanci's advice and look at it.


Q7: I don't know the answers to Teresa's questions.

H7a: You have all the information you need.
H7b: Be sure to examine the visa and passport before you give them up.
H7c: And take a look at the clothes.
H7d: Your full name is Alice Wei Ling.
H7e: You were born in Shanghai China.
H7f: The other questions require some deduction.
H7g: Remember to be simple when giving answers.


Q8: What's my age?

H8a: Have you examined yourself?
H8b: Alice is in her mid twenties. You could try guessing.
H8c: But there's a way to know for sure.
H8d: Examine the terminal and remember the passport.
H8e: You were born in 2141...
H8f: ...and the current year is 2165.
H8g: Your birthday has passed. That makes you 24 years old.


Q9: What's my previous occupation?

H9a: Did you examine your clothes?
H9b: Your cover story is you cleaned sewers in Shanghai.
H9c: So try sewer cleaner... or cleaner... or janitor.


Q10: What about marital status and child's name?

H10a: Remember the description of the visa.
H10b: You're a widow. That'll work, and so will single.
H10c: Nanci gives you a clue to the child's name.
H10d: Baby boy? Personal signature?
H10e: Nanci named the child after himself.


Q11: I've tried using the antiviral inhaler, but nothing happens.

H11a: Have you examined the inhaler?
H11b: Focused on the inhaler?
H11c: There's more to it than first appears.
H11d: It doesn't work because the inside is hollow.
H11e: Have you tried opening it?
H11f: Pulling obviously doesn't work.
H11g: Look at the description closer.
H11h: You can unscrew the inhaler.
H11i: It can be used to transport small items around the 
      arcology undetected. Useful for illegal stuff.


Q12: What's this black screwdriver?

H12a: It looks like a normal screwdriver.
H12b: But the description might tip you off.
H12c: Nanci's the technical one.
H12d: Focus on the screwdriver.
H12e: It's actually a morphtool.
H12f: Best put it back in the inhaler for now.


Q13: What should I do in the decontamination chamber?

H13a: Most stuff here is as it appears.
H13b: You need to clean yourself.
H13c: First throw those work clothes in the chute.
H13d: Then take a shower by standing on the platform.
H13e: You can now get the bodysuit.


Q14: I've put the bodysuit on but it doesn't come off.

H14a: That's intentional. It's designed that way.
H14b: You'll be wearing the bodysuit for the rest of the game.
H14c: So get used to it.


Q15: I can't leave the decontamination chamber.

H15a: You can't go back the way you came.
H15b: So you need to go north.
H15c: First you need to get changed. See the above hints.
H15d: There's one more thing you need to do.
H15e: Did you examine the bodysuit?
H15f: That indentation looks useful.
H15g: Got anything rectangular shaped?
H15h: Put the ID tag on the suit.
H15i: Now you can proceed.


Q16: What can I look for in the level directory?

H16a: Anything you want.
H16b: It lists what's on certain Arcology levels.
H16c: If you need to find a place, this is where to look it up.


Q17: Where should I go first?

H17a: You don't have a lot of choice.
H17b: Remember Nanci's advice.
H17c: Find your apartment. Look that up in the directory.
H17d: You're not the luxurious type.
H17e: You need to go to the standard apartments on level 18.


Q18: What items can I take in the transporter tubes?

H18a: Certain items are restricted to the level you find them.
H18b: And other things are completely illegal.
H18c: There's more information in your apartment.
H18d: And it might be a good idea to inspect the inhaler more 
      closely. See the above hints for more advice.

1.                      >THE UNHOLY MAN<

  The  preacher was in  fact a thief who  had stolen the original
manuscript of Hamlet  from an  exhibit on the  Riviera, where  he
also  acquired his tan. The  preacher disguised the manuscript as
a Bible and had Longworth authenticate it for the Duke, whom  the
preacher  hoped would  buy it.  Longworth, however,  in desperate
need of money, killed the preacher with Hamlet's sword and  stole
the  manuscript.  Longworth,  who  does  not  smoke,  planted the
German-made cigarette near the  victim's body to throw  suspicion
from  himself; but  in the  process, he  accidentally dropped his
packet of aspirin.

   Sir Reginald Cosgrove, in dire need of money, concocted a plot
to collect money from his large insurance policy on Silver Patch.
Sir  Reginald painted  over the silver  patch on the  mane of his
prize horse  and painted  a silver  patch on  the mane  of  Night
Dancer,  another  of  his  horses. He  then  switched  stalls and
poisoned  Night  Dancer,  who  now  looked  like  Silver   Patch.
Realizing  that  he  would  have to  take  Oscar  Switt  into his
confidence, Sir Reginald arranged for his trainer to meet him  at
the  stables. When Switt refused to  go along with Sir Reginald's
plan to kill Night Dancer, Sir Reginald became enraged and killed
the  trainer, smashing him over the head with an ale bottle, then
stabbing him repeatedly with the  broken bottle.

he decided to take justice into  his own hands and "execute"  Van
Nogh.  When Arnoux confronted  Van Nogh, he  permitted the Doctor

Afterwards, thinking  that  he  needed a  more  credible  suicide

  Sir  Edmund  Hillman was  an  old fashioned  hero: adventurous,
modest and widely admired. Dr.  Simon "Sy" Klopps who scaled  the
Eiger  with Hillman deeply resented that his team leader gathered
"all the glory"  for the  climb. Motivated by  intense envy,  Dr.
Klopps  utilized his considerable skills  as a hypnotist to cause
Sir Edmund to disgrace himself  by appearing to shoplift  clothes
bearing  the  Eiger  fashions  logo.  Holmes  realized  that  Sir
Edmund's doodles  of  a  green  eye in  the  Eiger  revealed  the
solution  to the case. Sir  Edmund's subconscious mind associated
Dr. Klopps with the  one-eyed monster of  myth, the cyclops.  The
green  eye on the sketch suggested envy as a motive and hypnotism
as the means of the crime.

Whig Sir Leroy Tick,  derived a double  benefit from his  zealous
supporter's  actions  since the  murders  not only  decreased the
number of Labour votes but also  provided him with a strong  "law

Byron to commit murder, he set  the shocking events in motion  by

  Dr. Van Nogh was a man  with a guilty conscience. He served  in
the  British Army during the South  African Campaign; but when he
was captured in battle he became a traitor and fought on the side
of the Boers. Hence his cryptic remark that he had been a "bloody
bore". His  commanding  officer, General  Vernon  Arnoux,  always
suspected  Van Nogh's treason but  could never prove it. Finally,
he decided to take justice into  his own hands and "execute"  Van
Nogh.  When Arnoux confronted  Van Nogh, he  permitted the Doctor
to  write  a  suicide  note.  The  general  killed  Van  Nogh  by
injecting  air  into  the  man's arm  with  a  hypodermic needle.
Afterwards, thinking  that  he  needed a  more  credible  suicide
method,  General Arnoux poured cyanide into the dead man's mouth.

real _WORK_.  This was fun to write and, I hope, fun to read too.

Any mistakes, corrections, etc., even of blatant typos, can be mailed to me at

The year is 2400 A. D. and the Tzorg Empire has enslaved the city of Metropolis
for a while in its quest for galactic domination.  But wait!  There's hope!
You, with the help of the Underground, a covert resistance movement, can stop
them.

I have asterisked out quests where you just need to find information.  They are
not strictly necessary, but they are neat puzzles.  Also alternative solutions
are labeled with "+."  They may require knowledge found elsewhere in the game.

First, start with intelligence=agility=endurance=30, and affinity=9.  If you
really need to improve affinity just talk to someone, cut off the conversation,
and talk again. That's one affinity point.  For endurance, run or climb stairs-
-
lowers it short-term, raises the maximum long-term. Agility comes from fixing 
or
using weapons, and intelligence comes from fixing or using items.  NEVER, NEVER
use a booster pill.  They're not worth it.  Boost labs are too hard to get to
although they are a neat puzzle.  Look for Fritz in the underground if you
really want to know.

The first thing to do is to go to Joe's Bar.  It's a building north and two to
the east of where you start the game.  Spider is in back, behind the bar.  He's
lying down. Now, he'll ask you to go to Johnnie's Corner to see Reggie, who 
will
tell you a password.  It isn't necessary to get the password, but if you don't,
you'll need to get a loan off Brehm's Bank at loan-shark rates.  Even Brehm
tells you the way you should be making money is by killing robots. Searching 
for
and finding energy cells and selling them at 5 credits is another, but it's a
little more tedious.  However, if you're out of credits and guns, this is
viable.  If you're out of ammo, just reload, get killed, and pick up your gun
again in the authority center.

**At Johnnie's Corner:  It's in the east sector.  Run all the way east(to avoid
the checker robot and social demerits) and Johnnie's corner is to the south of
the end of the walkway.  Johnnie's at the bar.  He'll tell you Reggie's 
upstairs
if you ask about REGGIE.  Go upstairs and ask Reggie the PASSWORD.  By the way,
the stairs up/down are a great way to improve your endurance.  Most of the
places have tubes.

++An alternative way to get there is to enter the transporter just outside of
the check-in center and type "LETSGO" and then "01" which sends you to the
transporter just outside Johnnie's Corner.

Back chez Spider you'll get Plastiform(healing) and a hand blaster and a
passcard, which opens the door in the Novue Apartments, behind which you can 
get
to the underground. Don't worry about getting energy, or that you can't load
from an energy node without attracting attention.  In the underground there is 
a
place with unlimited energy cells.  There's also another place in the Megatech
warehouse that has lots of energy cells.  Rudy tells you about them.

++If you don't have a weapon, Spider will give you another.  This may be a 
cheap
cheaty way to get credits.  Talk to Spider, drop a weapon, talk to Spider, etc.

The first thing you'll want to concentrate on is buying a light shield.  It is
500 credits and can be found in the underground.  I'd advise picking off robots
guarding the borders first.  To sneak behind them, either run on the walkways 
or
use the transporters(type LETSGO and then at the second prompt type 01, 02, 03,
04 to send you to the restricted zones, and 00 sends you to the Public Tracking
Office!)  The checker will follow you, and you will probably want to sucker him
into a corner.  Then attack him.  A recurring strategy for fighting robots is 
to
arrange things so you take on one at a time instead of several.

By the way, if you get "killed," just search for the loose panel in the west of
your cell.  Climb down to the first level underground, then go west and climb
back up.  You'll be in administration(the west side!)  Then go back to the
correctional center.  That's the first building after you leave the western
zone, on your north.  Your items are in a box in the southwest corner of the
first level.  Items are put there whenever you go to jail, so this happens if
you Z(urrender) too!  It's convenient and makes the game easier, but you can't
help wondering that security's a little lax.  (Also, confiscated items go 
here!)

After you get the light shield you can attack robots with a little more 
abandon.
I'd wait until you have 1000 credits to buy stuff from Wes(i.e. a Laser 
Cutter).
In fact, you might want to buy a lot from Wes and sell it back to Tim so that 
he
will give(that's right, give!) you the plasma rifle.  Of course, the rifle will
be broke, but we'll get to that later.  Your next priority should be the
blueprints.  If you've been "working out" your energy by climbing stairs at
Jonnie's Corner(or other stairs) it will be pretty high by now.  Once it's over
50, you can break into the orange handled "heavy" door in Megatech.  Behind it
is the blueprint room--there are some strange blueprints you should give to 
Les.
Ask him to BUILD the blueprints, and he will charge the modest fee of 3500.
It's worth it.  The field disperser is great armor(you can ignore attacks from
level 2 robots!) and will get you through force fields if you keep it charged.
It won't break, either!  With the field disperser the robots can't bug you any
more above ground, unless you poke around in the upper levels of the
correctional facility.  After this, you should concentrate on getting the very
best weapons with your credits.  There's not that much else to buy, anyhow.

But what about puzzles?  Stop off in the south subway to find the transporter
guidance device.  Make sure you don't get hit by a train!  There are some tough
level 4 monsters there so you may be best off to wait until they lose their
"charge."  This is a surprisingly effective strategy at any point.  Robots have
to recharge a lot, and they die out.  Just walk past them then.  Behind them in
the second room, you find the TGD.  Don in the hospital gives you the 
transporter
combination, 18-09-12-15.  I'll tell you what this means later.

**Off to the west there's another part of the underground. For a superquick
walkthrough you don't need to do this, just copy the deactivization codes, but
the puzzles are rather fun, and I recommend trying them before "copping out."
There are access terminals that give deactivization codes so you can win the
game.  Asking around at administration tells you they're behind Marion's 
office.
It's one of those doors you need 50 endurance to break down, but don't worry.
There are no robots in this part of the underground, so you'll get your
endurance back with no trouble.  Once you follow the hall and go downstairs,
you'll have to climb over some pipes to get down to the second level.  Again
climb over some pipes to get to the first access terminal.  As Jimmy told you 
in
the west underground, "ACCTRM"(level minus 2) gives "ACCTRM0" as access code.
Type CODES to avoid the humorous error messages, giving you the first
deactivization code, CHLOBU.  The tube to the second level reveals a bunch of
conveyor belts.  If you don't feel like mapping them out, here's the shortcut.
Take the one to the east and follow it until it turns south. When you branch to
the south and west, go west and then take the next turn to the north.  Beyond
the belt is an access terminal.  Type ACCTRM1 and then CODES to get the second
code, PERABR.  For the third terminal go south and then east.  You will find
transporter 05(read when you're around the transporter!)  A wild guess, or
"seeing" the transporters beneath the garbage dump on the north side, might 
make
you try LETSGO and 06.  Voila!  Level 4.  Now there are a bunch of bins you 
need
to push around. Basically, you can only push a bin onto an empty space. You'll
want to get to a 2x2 room over on the west side, and on top of it, if you go
over there, the disk may re-load and re-shuffle the bins to their original
position, leaving you trapped.  Don't worry about being trapped--you can push
your way back out or even Z(urrender) if you must.  The pattern to get to the
third terminal is below("go W" means go all the way west):
2W, 3S of terminal 6.  Push W 2x.
Go N, Go W, Go S.  Push W 5x.  N.  Push E 2x.  N. W. Go 2S, W.  Push W.  S.  E.
Push E.  S.  W.  S.  W.  Push N.  Open door to W, go W twice.  Talk W, 
"ACCTRM2"
and "CODES" gives you EDDONE, the third and final code.

Getting to the Tzorg complex is tricky--go to the waste dump in the north, but
you might want to make sure you have two weapons loaded before you enter.  
Enter
the dump from the north and go to the east.  There is a maze, not too tricky,
but you will swing around to the southwest corner where you'll find stairs 
down.
Here's where you hit the "funny" transporters.  If you don't have the
Transporter Guidance Device, you won't be able to complete this part.
Basically, you want to enter transporter 7.  Teleport to transporter 18(type
"LETSGO" and "18") and then 09, then 12, then 15, like Don told you in the
hospital.  Go east and take the stairs down.  Then you'll encounter four
teleporters. Doesn't matter which one you enter.  They're teleporters 19-22.
The one on the other side is, logically, 23.  "LETSGO" and "23" gets you there.
From there, don't enter any side rooms but go south.  Then off to the west is a
heavy-duty door.  There are robots behind there but let the robots plug up the
doorways, so you'll only have to take on one at a time.  After opening three
"heavy" doors there is a north-south hallway.  Skip by the hallway, and don't 
go
out until your endurance is high enough to take a few hits before you make it
through. Most of the guard robots are stationary but they're not guarding
anything.  Just keep going west through the doors. There's only one way to go
after that.  You'll find yourself in a narrow hallway going north.  Don't exit
it--just fight the robots one at a time.  There's also a possibility they'll
need to recharge--in that case, to the east of the passage's end and the south
is a place to recharge.  If you keep going east, behind a heavy door you will
find some much less difficult robots.  Get rid of them, and then look for
bookcases along the north wall.  Behind one of them is a flight of stairs.  
Each
time you go up, there'll be more stairs close by.  Always take them.  At one
point you'll have a choice between a conveyor belt and the stairs.  Take the
stairs.  The conveyor belt is a convoluted one-way ticket back to Metropolis,
away from the secret entrance.  Climb up the stairs again and note a heavy door
to the right.  If you enter the Authority Complex directly you can break that
door open but couldn't climb over the garbage to get to where you are now.  Go
north through the force fields and save the game--just to be sure, as typos 
will
send you to the correctional center--before you type in CHLOBU, PERABR and
EDDONE to shut down the robots.  You win.  Enjoy the (primitive Apple IIe)
fireworks!

++-there is an alternate solution as well.  If you go through the front door of
the Tzorg Authority comlpex and get to the conveyor belt, you can cross it with
a jetpack.  Which means that the whole Transporter Guidance Device puzzle is
actually unneccessary.  Still it's fun to try this both ways.

All class 4 robots now due for maintenance and inspection.
As a celebration of the latest Tzorg victory in the seventh sector, double 
rations of sugar will be allowed today.
Due to several recent accidents, transproter Z-32-68 will be temporarily closed 
for repairs.
Due to increased subversive activities, patrols have been stepped up.
In the future, computer access will be limited to functions vital to the 
control of Metropolis.

WHAT DO UNIMPORTANT PEOPLE SAY?
Unimportant people appear randomly.  You can tell them by walking off the 
screen and back on and seeing if they're still there.

WHAT FACTORS WEAKEN/IMPROVE MY ATTRIBUTES?
Endurance:  Climb the stairs(keep doing it up and down) or run instead of 
walking to improve maximum endurance.  WARNING:  This decreases your total 
temporarily.  You can also get an endurance boost.  I recommend climbing up and 
down in Johnnie's Corner, where you are safe, or in the underground just before 
you go exploring.  Any time you won't be fighting soon.  Plastiform also heals 
you, as does stopping in at the hospital.  Of course, you lose endurance if you 
are shot and hit.  You can even lose endurance if shot at, but much, much less 
rapidly.
IQ:  Use transporters.  Fix items.  Use technical items like scanners or grid-
reads.
Agility:  Shoot weapons a bunch of times.  Also fixing broken weapons helps.
Affinity:  Talk to people.  Salesmen will always listen to you, and they'll 
help your affinity too.
I recommend starting with 9 affinity and 30 each of the other attributes.
Booster pills raise attributes to 99 but decrease the maximums.
Attributes recharge at the rate of 1 attribute point every turn for each 
attribute.

WHAT ARE GOOD COMBAT STRATEGIES?
Use unconscious people as a bunker.  You can shoot over them, but robots can't.  
Don't worry if an "important" person is shot.  They reappear after you leave 
the area.
If you can get on a walkway, do so.  That can allow you double firing power, 
and you can flee quickly too.  You'll probably want to be on a walkway in a 
restricted zone, because there are too many robots in the central zone.  Which 
leads me to another point:
Fight one robot at a time.  The best way is to sucker a Checker into following 
you.  Then blast him in a deserted alley.  That leaves two sentries but run 
away again and often you'll only have to face one.
You might even want to blast mechanical arms if you are lucky enough to find 
them.  They can't fight back.
Finally, if you are low on ammo/endurance, remember to search if you've killed 
a robot;  the credits will stay, and you can always pick up your weapons later.

Also, avoid being on a diagonal with a Tzorg robot.  They can attack you, but 
you can't attack them.

HOW DO I FIND THE UNDERGROUND?
Behind the locked door in the Novue Apartments(east)
Behind bookcases on the west side of Administration(west)
Behind Marion's office in Administration(west, to access terminals)
In the garbage dump(north)
Climb around in the subway(south station especially, transporter guidance 
device)
Behind a locked door at Larry's(central)
Find the fake wall in your cell and climb down from the Tzorg Authority 
Complex.

HOW DO I GET SOCIAL DEMERITS?
'Elp!  'Elp!  A Nanarchist!  Well, they'll get wiped out after a trip to the 
Rehab Center.  But seriously...
Checker catches you in a restricted zone without a passcard
Don't check in on time to Public Tracking Office
Shoot at a robot to instigate combat
Set off a bomb
Pay a loan late at Brehm's
Load an item from a node
Get a boost at a lab

HOW DO I GET SENT TO THE SOCIAL REHABILITATION CENTER?
Gain too many social demerits and submit willingly
Pass out(run/climb too much) without enough money for the hospital
Get shot down by robots
Get run over by a subway train and don't have hospital money.
Type Z(Zurrender), which is excellent if you're lost.
Break into the control console but type in the wrong codes.

I GOT KILLED.  HOW DO I START FROM SCRATCH?
You don't have to if you're killed, but even if you do, just leave the rehab 
center and re-enter(search your cell wall to the west, climb down, go west, 
climb up, and go back east).  On level 1, in the southeast corner, you'll find 
some familiar equipment in an open box!

TRANSPORTERS.  HOW DO I USE THEM?

Sid, in the storage part of the underground, tells you the code.  Type LETSGO, 
and the transporter will ask you for a code.
Below is a table of codes and locations.

WHO SELLS WHAT?

Wes, Nguyen, and Verne sell stuff in the underground.
You find this out from Carlos.

Jeff sells passcards at the east end one level down.
0150 ZACs
0050 Passcards
Passcards are based on hexadecimal numbers.  For instance, passcard FA74 opens 
up a door at location (F*16)+A, (7*16)+4, where F=15, E=14, ..., B=11, A=10.  
Thus that location would be 234, 116.  Read the door you want to open for its 
location.

Wes(central area)
0050 Hand Phaser
0120 Hand Blaster
0500 Mini Cutter
1000 Laser Cutter
2000 Blaster Rifle
3000 Pulse Laser
0200 Stun gun

Nguyen(by storage area)--does not tell his name
0850 Video Scrambler
0500 Directive Override
0300 Scanner
0200 Disruptor
0500 Light Shield
0025 Booster Pill
0050 Plastiform
0250 Hologram Projector

Verne(west side)--does not tell his name
0050 Plastiform
0300 Disrupter
0125 Time Bomb
0100 Detonator
0025 Booster Pill
0875 Heavy Shield
0300 Scanner
0850 Video Scrambler

Guy who sells energy cells
175 25 units
300 50 units
500 99 units
This is a rip-off, since you can get unlimited free energy cells very close.
He buys them at (# of charges)/16, rounded down.
That's one outrageous mark-up, but if you're desperate, sell him cells.

Tim buys stuff in the underground.  He generally offers 40% of its worth.
The plasma rifle sells for 4700 credits so it would be worth ~12000.
But as it's very powerful and doesn't break, and you don't need credits, just 
keep the plasma rifle.

Above ground:
Gilbert doesn't sell anything, but he does exchange stuff.
Trade ENERGY REGULATOR(700 at Larry's) for a MICROSTAT.
Also, look in back for a MULTIPLIER TUBE Gilbert threw out.

Spider gives you a passcard, hand blaster, and plastiform.
You start with a hand phaser and grid read.

Larry sells some important things.
0250 ????
0450 Hi-Voltage Oscillator
0700 Energy regulator

Hugo charges you 0550 to fix the plasma rifle and tells you the items needed.
In general he charges 1/10 the value of a broken weapon.

Also, you can find booster pills when you climb down from your cell in the 
Rehabilitation Center.  But you can't sell them, and they're not really very 
good for you.

WHAT ARE THE MONSTERS' NAMES?
Level 1 monsters
Checker:  Looks like a TV with a heart-monitor line running across it.  It will 
ask you for ZAC's.  IF you have none, you get a social demerit.  If you do, it 
allows you to proceed.  It may follow you even if you are in the central zone.
Sentry:  Technicolor R2D2's.  Two at each border to the restricted areas.
Adjustable barstool thing(?):  I forget what this is called.  I lost my 2400 
A.D. manual.
Mechanic:  a long pincer-like arm on a platform.  It cannot attack you.
Confiscator(?):Looks like a vacuum cleaner with static cling.  It asks you to 
submit to a contraband check.  If you don't, it issues a security alert.  If 
you do, items are confiscated, but they can be found at the Rehabilitation 
Center.

WHERE ARE THE BOOSTER LABS?
Fritz in the west part of the underground knows;  take the corner door each 
time, but don't forget the way back!  At one place there is a choice between 
two non-corner doors.  One leads to the endurance labs, one to the IQ labs.  Be 
prepared to spend time(1000 units) and credits(1500 units) there.

HOW DO I GET THE ITEMS YOU CAN'T BUY?
Wes hands over the plasma rifle after you've bought stuff from him for a while.  
Selling to Tim may help you get the item earlier.
The plasma rifle costs 550 to fix + 450 for a high-voltage oscillator + 700 for 
the energy regulator to trade for a microstat.  You also need a multiplier tube 
Gilbert threw out.  Hugo fixes the plasma rifle for you.
The transporter guidance device is in the south subway.  You have to climb on 
the pipes separating the tracks(unless you want to risk getting hit by a 
train!)  The device is in the east room.

WHAT DIALOGS ARE THERE?

Here is a laundry list of the dialogs.  They're not organized yet, because I 
only extracted the names from the files.  However, you can tell who says what 
by searching the document text.

I believe this is complete except for typos.  I used a hexadecimal editor to 
extract the information but typed a lot of it from a printout.

THE DIALOG BIT

What people say(in general):

(You asked about something they don't understand)
You know everything I know about that.
I really can't help you with that.
Pardon me?
What I know about that is of no use to you.
My knowledge of that subject can't help you.

(You terminate the conversation)
So long.
Bye now.
Take care.
Good luck!

(Everyone knows about these:)
WEAPONS:  They sell weapons in the underground complex.
DEVICES:  I've heard that lots of strange things can be bought in the 
underground complex.
SPIDER:  Try around at Joe's.

(Underground, everyone says this:)
COMP:  What's a computer?
ROBO:  I never want to see one again!
SUBW:  Take the down tubes in the stations.
TOKE:  the subway at ...

(Random things:)
Soon the Tzorgs will have us all brainwashed.
Things were so much nicer before the Tzorgs came.
I'm busy, please let me be!
I despise robots!
I'd like to talk, but I'm in a hurry.

(low charisma:)
Funny...You're ignored.

for humans.
All class 4 robots are now due for maintenance and rehabilitation.
The government is happy to announce the rehabilitation of 10 more citizens.  
Another reminder of your Tzorg government at work.
Section A is behind its work quota.  All units will work additional shifts 
until this condition is rectified.
A seminar on attitude management will be given at the Rehabilitation Ctr.  All 
citizens are encouraged to attend.

(what access terminals say to you--it varies depending on the level):
Syntax error.
Mouth held wrong error.
Incorrect grammar error.
Random annoying error.
BYE:  Access terminated.
CODE:  The primary deactivization code is ******.
LOCA:  You are * floors beneath Metropolis.

**Alternate Reality: The Dungeon**

RSC: IIGS Key to Dungeon Survival

     By now you probably know that certain CDA's, like DSR's "Diversi Hack"  and the built-in "Visit Monitor", permit game interruption, monitor diddling, and program resumption on the IIGS. This opens whole new vistas to SERIOUS gamers, including diskless Realtime Situation Control. With RSC, you can hop into the monitor in mid-combat to juice-up dwindling hitpoints, create food packets for a starving character, shift map coordinates, etc., etc..

     My first 'RSC module' is directed to "Alternate Reality"  mavens enmeshed in the labyrinthine Dungeon. Assuming you have installed either "'Hack" or "Visit '", during play do a CMD-CTRL-ESC, go to the monitor, and enter 800.8FF (RETURN). Here you will find most of your character parms and staple supplies: (All addresses are Hex offsets from $800.)

EXPERIENCE: 3E-40   HITPOINTS current/base: 45,46/47,48   GOLD: B1,B2
SILVER: B3,B4   COPPER: B5,B6   GEMS: B7,B8   JEWELS: B9,BA   FOOD: BB   WATER: BC
TORCHES: BD   CRYSTALS: BE   KEYS: BF  COMPASSES: C0   TIMEPIECES: C1.

The following parms are repeated, single-byte numbers:
STAMINA: 49/4A   CHARISMA: 51/52   STAMINA: 59/5A   INTELLIGENCE: 61/62
WISDOM: 69/6A  SKILL: 71/72.

LOCATION horizontal/vertical/map#: 13/14/15. The game views the 64x64 Level 1 as four 32x32 maps. Coordinates are $00-$1F left-to-right and up to down; maps #0-#3 are NW, NE, SW, SE sections of Level 1. For example, entering 813: 16 03 01 (RETURN) will place you just outside the "Retreat" upon returning to play.


__________________________


** Cryllan Mission: 2088 (original mission)**

Crusin' on Crylla: 2088

     A good guide to party composition is your standard U.S.S. Enterprise "away team". One doctor can handle all healing chores; a science officer supplies large-area map views (via "Terrain" and "Life Form" scans); and, you need the fire-power of your four weapons specialists.

     Explore the Ruins thoroughly; the Caverns are good for loot and honing combat technique; take care of things in Adion before entering Cramur. Transports are expensive and you cannot take them into mazes; Heavy Armor is a better investment. The best weapons are won from elite enemy guards.

     Finally, two items which should have been included in your mission briefing (i.e. the manual): 1. To enter a transport you've purchased, the first step is to move onto the transport figure and 'click'; 2. Any resurrected team member will have reduced attributes. Don't waste time trying to cure this condition (you can't); after a day or so the attributes will return to normal values.

** Dark Heart of Uukrul**

Become Master of the Game!  (II Alive, 1996)

     When I found Broderbund's Dark Heart of Uukrul for sale at a recent swap meet, it was snapped up without a second thought. Long on my "Must Try" list, the game has proved to be a fine multi-character adventure, playing much like such D&D greats as Champions of Krynn.

     Inevitably, there came a time when it seemed that "'Uukrul" had 'done me wrong'. Expensive armor and weapons were destroyed, rare artifacts were used up, etc. due to what seemed to be inordinately bad luck and/or an unfair lack of information. Then, my party came upon a message etched into a Temple wall: "When all else fails, cheat!" That was the last straw.

     The ultimate "game crack" is to have control of character attributes, items, money, etc.. One tactic is to use a block editor (such as the one included with ProSel)  to search the Save diskette for a character's name and, then, edit on-diskette Game Save info. This did not work with 'Uukrul. The changes were made with no great difficulty but detected by the game as invalid. Evidently, Game Save data is protected via some kind of check sum.

     You can, often, get around such schemes on the GS by doing an OA-CTRL-ESC, going to Visit Monitor, finding the character info stuff in memory, and doing the changes there. (If, after starting System 6, Visit Monitor does not show up as an option, go to the SetStart control panel, click "Enable Programmer CDA's", and reboot.)

    'Uukrul is supposed to be "uncrackable"; so, naturally, it disables interrupts during key accesses. OA-CTRL-ESC is ignored. (Foiled again!)

     Happily, there is more than one way to skin a dragon. If the game shuts down OA-CTRL-ESC access, then, perhaps, we should change the game program! A good start is to search the on-diskette copy of the main program for instances of AD 00 C0, a machine code instruction often used to read the keyboard. There are very few of these in Uukrul; so, it was easy to isolate the main KB input routine.

      On my 5.25" version of the game, I found the routine beginning at byte $110 in block $A5 on the Boot diskette:

2C 00 C0
10 FB
AD 00 C0

     On a copy of the Boot diskette, this became ...

58
AD 00 C0
10 FB
78
EA

     The new routine enables interrupts, waits for a keypress, and, then, disables interrupts. This, essentially, "cracks" the game. The GS user can interrupt the program at practically any moment, do a Visit Monitor, make desired changes, and exit back to the game.

     Although you will need to start System 6 in order to mount the Visit Monitor CDA, 'Uukrul, at least the 5.25" version, does not launch from GS/OS. It is a Pascal-based game which boots from its own diskette. This is nice because it means that you will not need to hunt for the program in GS memory. It will reside in memory Bank $00.

     In 'Uukrul, you find the party's Food, as a two-byte hexadecimal value, at address $976E.  As usual, the low byte is first; so, for example, 5E 01 means you have $15E, or, in decimal, 350 Food packets. (By the way, a cheapo Radio Shack calculator which does hex-to-decimal conversions is very handy for this kind of work!)  The Party's Money is saved as decimal, lower bytes first, starting at address $9770.

     If, while in the monitor in 80-column mode, you enter 97E0.98EF (RETURN), you will see that character names show up in the right side of the display. As in most such adventures, 'Uukrul stores data for individual characters beginning with Name followed soon by Experience (in decimal)  and values of attributes, like Dexterity, Piety, ...,  in hexadecimal. To make it easier to see what's where, it's a good idea to jot down attributes, hit points, spell points, experience, etc. before going to Visit Monitor.

     Toward the end of a character's entry are his/her possessions (weapons, armor, healing salve, etc.)  stored as two-byte codes. For instance, if a magic user is wearing Silken Robes, you will find 02 55. A charged-up Wand of Potency is 58 D0 and one which is worn out is 58 D8. (To recharge any charged item, you just change the final "8" to "0".)  Figuring out what code goes with which item is fun and, as you can see, very useful!

     The best time to interrupt most adventures is during some non-special situation, such as while your party is exploring a maze. Once the mods (e.g. more Money, more Food, etc.)  are done, you return to the game.

     Your changes may not, immediately, be reflected in the display. No problem. Walking around a bit, battling some monsters, or visiting a shop will usually force a display update. (This also lets the program reinit pointers and other values which may have been affected.)  Once it's clear that your mods have taken affect, do a Save.

     When making changes, a good 'rule of thumb' is to avoid extremes. For example, if you need food, give yourself 400-500 packets, not 65535! Few D&D style adventures allow attribute values much above 18 (12 in hex); setting Strength to something like 127 ($7F) could bomb the program.

     If increasing a character's Experience, it is best to set a value just below the point at which the next Level increase occurs. Otherwise, your higher Level may be recognized; but, you may get none of the Hit Point, Attribute, etc. boosts which go with advancement!

    Similarly, when you decide to add some item to a character's inventory, do it by overwriting some other, roughly similar item. For instance, add a Healing Potion by replacing, say, a Flask of Poison, not a 75 lb Mace! This reduces the chance of problems in games which maintain a separate item count for each character or keep track of total weight of items carried.

     Perhaps most important, you do not want to spoil the game's challenge. Giving your party enough money to replace a valuable suit of Elfin Chain Mail destroyed by a lucky hit from an Acid Lizard may make sense; but, awarding your party 100,000 gold would ruin the value of many rewards supplied by the game for completing difficult quests. The same principle applies to Hit Points, Spell Points, etc..

     In fact, 'breaking into' any game produces a new challenge: win with the minimum use of the powers at your disposal. Others, lacking such arcane knowledge, are free of this dilemma. Alas, it is a burden you must bear once becoming Master of the Game!

** Deathlord **

Becoming a Deathlord Survivor

     Possibly, you are enmeshed in "Deathlord" (or, eventually, will be) and are perplexed by 'hero die-off'. (Even Gorbash, winner of Ultima's IV and V, M&M I and II, etc., put "Deathlord" on the back burner for a few months.)  One solution, as usual, is 'super-natural intervention'-- i.e. you diddle a few character parms and, SHAZAM!, your guys suddenly feel stronger, faster, smarter, and richer! A second trick is to minimize the damage should a 'worst case scenario' eventuate.


[The "SHAZAM" approach is to edit character attributes. When you do this, it's a good idea to have a list of each character's current Hit Points, Strength, etc.. This makes it easier to check which attribute is being changed (and whose) when doing the editing.

It is a good idea to make backups before editing. If playing on an emulator, you can use the Windows Copy option to put a duplicate of your DSK's in another folder.

If you've been playing on an emulator or using a 'deprotected' copy of the game, the DSK's or diskettes may be 'open'-- at least open enough so that the patch described in steps 1-3 should be skipped. Try starting Copy II Plus's Sector Editor, inserting the Scenario A disk, and going to step 4. If Sector Editor can not read the sector mentioned, you will probably need to do steps 1-3.]


     First, the SHAZAM solution: Using Central Point's "Copy II Plus" ($39.95, for 128K Apple) and DOS alteration data found in Rob Fiduccia's "Deathlord" article in issue #63, we scanned the Scenario A diskette and found character data in sector $0D on track $13. (1. Go to 5.25" Bit Copy.  2. In the Sector Editor enter "P" to get to the DOS patcher and then "Custom".  3. Under "Address", change D5 AA 96 to D5 AA D6 and DE AA to DE B7. Under "Data", change D5 AA AD to D5 AE AD and DE AA ... to EA AA ... . 4. Exit the patcher and Read T/S $13/$0D. NOTE: Should you wish to scan the diskette starting at track $0, expect to encounter a few unreadable sectors along the way. Just skip these and continue.)


[Character attributes in games are usually coded as hexadecimal values. For example, if the first character in your party has a Strength of 17, you would expect to find 11 ($11 = decimal 17) at byte $72 of the sector when viewed with the Copy II Plus Sector Editor.

For a two-byte value, like 270 Hit Points (max) for the first character, the hex value is $10E and you would expect to find 0E at byte $42 and $01 at byte $48.]
  

     On the Sector Editor screen, you should find character data arranged in six-byte groups (one byte per character) starting at the following bytes:

$42: Hit Points, max (low byte)
$48: Hit Points, max (high byte)
$4E: Hit Points, current (low byte)
$54: Hit Points, current (high byte)

$66: Level                           $72: Strength
$78: Constitution                    $7E: Size
$84: Intelligence                    $8A: Dexterity
$90: Charisma                        $96: Power, current
$9C: Power, max                      $CC: Age
$D2: Food                            $D8: Gold (low byte)
$DE: Gold (high byte).

Edit as desired, write your SHAZAMed characters back to disk, and your quest against the Deathlord is a 'whole new ball game'.


     Granted, if you max-out every parm and give each character $10,000 gold, there isn't much your party can't handle. If, however, you merely go for a "fair start", then the inconvenience associated with having several characters wiped out remains a threat.

     You can make a character backup each time you start the game; but, of course, you won't. It's too much bother, the backup won't restore hours of progress made in the current session, and, besides, there's a better way!

     Use the "Make Scenario" function to create a copy of each current scenario diskette on its unused side. During play, you just do an occasional SAVE on alternate sides. If your party is wiped out and saved as dead on Side One, you can restart from Side Two, etc.. Whatever happens, you will never lose more than the progress made since the last opposite-side SAVE.

** Defender of the Crown **

Defending the Crown

     In Cinemaware's new adventure/wargame, "Defender of the Crown", crunching the opposition takes a lot of practice. You can take it on the chin for however many sessions it takes to 'learn the ropes'; OR you can employ a touch of Realtime Situation Control to make those 'practice games' into victories!

     As usual, the "Visit Monitor" CDA (or some equivalent) must be installed before booting the game. During play, enter CMD-CTRL-ESC to call up the CDA menu, select "Visit Monitor", and enter 03/BC00.BC2F (RETURN) to view the main status bytes for you and your five rivals (arranged in six-byte sets). Whether "Wolfric the Wild" or some other Saxon, your parms are always first in each set: INCOME ($03/BC03), LEADERSHIP ($03/BC0F), JOUSTING ($03/BC15), SWORD FIGHTING ($03/BC0B), and TREASURY ($03/BC2D).

     For long play, with plenty of opportunity to practice jousting, sieges, and sword fighting, all you really need is a big army. This you obtain by juicing-up your treasury (e.g. $03/BC2D: F0). Of course, you will certainly want to try your hand at raids and fair maiden rescues(!); so, just boost your sword fighting skill (e.g. $03/BC0B: 1F). Thusly imbued with truth, justice, and raw power, you are ready to hone your technique AND to guarantee that the Crown of England doesn't fall into the wrong hands!

** Dragon Wars **

Dragon Wars Survivors

     How many new guys have YOU lost in Interplay's "Dragon Wars"? Well, that's too many! Before you send in another bunch of doomed weakies, (if you are playing on a IIgs) send your characters through the Computist Enhanced Experience Environment (i.e. the "C3E").

C3E Directions:

Install a monitor entry CDA (e.g. "Diversi Hack") in the Desktop and boot the game. Once you have four characters, do an OpenApple-CTRL-ESC to get to the Desktop; and enter the monitor.

Character data blocks begin at $4000, $4200, $4400, and $4600. Just enter $7F at byte $3B in each block (e.g. $403B: 7F, $423B: 7F, etc.).

Return to the game and go to the Experience displays. Now, instead of only 50 points to spend on each character's attributes and displays, you will have 127!



    &&&&& Purgatory Lore Flyer (FREE! Please Take One) &&&&&

On a map of Purgatory (with X-Y coordinates of 0-31, 0-31), you begin at 19,12. Purgatory has five "towers" and is surrounded by two walls (with a passage between the walls).

Visit the small shop along the NW wall to acquire Low Magic scrolls.

Volunteers hang out at a bar in the NE.

Black marketeers sell weapons and armor in a North wall shop.

When you need a Magic Power recharge, check out a pool in the South Tower.

Don't overlook hidden doors in some of the other towers.

If you reach the gap in the SE outer wall, USE your Swim skill to get out.

**Elite**

An ELITE Craft (ref. Computist #70)

     Okay, gaining Elite combateer status and finding the mysterious planet Raxxla isn't supposed to be easy. (That's why they call the game "Elite".)  On the other hand, anything which can make your quest a bit less difficult is worth serious consideration. The Thargoid invaders certainly don't hesitate to implement every advantage their bug brains can contrive; why should YOU settle for less than the best in human technology?!

     Every combateer is well acquainted with the Mk III Cobra's major limitation: in galaxies where planetary distances can exceed 100 light years, your fighter/trader craft carries only about seven light years worth of hyperspace jump fuel. Nearly as bothersome, the standard Xexor/Hikan Ltd. intergalactic hyperdrive is good for only one hop; whereupon you must locate a new supplier AND shell out another 5000 credits! Happily, thanks to advanced research at Computist Corp.'s Turdnil Labs, BOTH of the above barriers have been shattered!!!


Specifications

CC/TL Super Jump: exclusive Tardis-pack for 25.5 LY range on standard fuel
CC/TL Multi-Galactic: new Dura-Wolfram core for unlimited repeat G-hops


Installation and Operation

     To implement the new designs, you must be able to RESET or NMI into the Apple monitor while "Elite" is running. For the many readers who have added special "$F8xx " PROMS or are using an OLD, pre-autostart, Apple II, this should be no problem. (Our II+ is equipped with home-brew firmware to allow forcing a "RESET into monitor". Unfortunately, "Elite"'s combat displays do not work correctly on the IIgs; and, besides, the OA-CTRL-ESC interrupt is defeated.)  The best time to break in is when docked and viewing one of the game's text displays.

     For Super Jump enter the following at $6F0C: A2 FF. This mod increases fuel top-off level (i.e. you can buy more). It does not affect fuel received should you use your Escape Pod or the amount which can be 'sun-skimmed'.

     To have access to multi-galactic jump capability, you must own a "Galactic Hyperspace" drive. (If you do not own one, installing the MG mod will allow multi-jumping as soon as you do.)  Enter $6BAE: A2 FF 8E BC 02 E8 EA EA EA 8E C3 02. The new code makes sure that, when you do a "G" hop, your inter-galactic drive is restored and legal status resets to "Clean".

     Once the enhancements are in place, entering $6E87G restarts the program. You will be docked at the current system's trading station. First, buy some fuel. Your status display will show "Fuel: 25.5 light years"! Switch to the Galaxy Display (i.e. "5" key) to see your new 'range circle'. (WOW!)  To try out Multi-Jump, blast off and do a "G". Zavoom! You're in the next galaxy; AND you still have a Galactic Hyperspace drive ready for another hop! To be sure, a very challenging quest remains; but, now, you are at the helm of a Cobra Mk III PLUS!


Elite Craft Tech Note (ref. Computist #76)

Turdnil Labs Maintenance Note EC/DE25.5/11.90/Elt. 

     Evidently,  as Bob Igo indicated last month, there ARE different versions of the game. I worked from an original supplied by Firebird at the time Elite was first released. All of the mods described in issue #70 were incorporated into an open copy of the original-- created to avoid having to make the changes upon each boot-- and they all work fine. That the code locations would be off by just one (e.g. $6F0C vs. $6F0D) in some versions is odd, but not unheard-of. Bob also notes that his fuel boost involved an LDY (i.e. $6F0D: A0 FF) instead of the LDX.

     Recommendations: After RESETing into the monitor, check the code in the areas to be changed. If you find $6F0C: A2 46, then the issue #70 stuff (as corrected in the above maintenance note) should perform as advertised. If you find A0 46, (A2 46, etc.) at a slightly offset location just change the $46 to $FF. The same holds for changes to $6BAE: AE BC 02 ... AND to program restart ("$6E87 G"). Instead of $6E87: A9 20, you may find $6E88: A9 20.

     As to completing the Navy's first mission: just follow directions. Two things may throw you off the scent of the rogue craft. First, you may not find clues at every station along the way, especially after a Galactic jump. (I picked up the trail in G2 at Errius.)  Second, wait a couple seconds after docking before you start punching keys; otherwise, some messages may be cut off. It's also a good idea to check the current planet's description upon docking.

     How to become Elite? There may be some shortcut; but, as far as I can tell, you become Elite by blowing away many MANY enemy ships.

**Generic 'Red Sheet' fix**

Getting the Red Out

     Granted, a software vendor has the right to protect its products any way it sees fit; and, when it employs documentation (instead of screwing-up the software), it deserves a pat on the nose. The dark red code sheets technique employed by some vendors comes close to being an exception. It's nice that they are machine-uncopiable (though, naturally, anyone determined to steal the product need only invest an hour or so to make a copiable hand copy). It's too bad that, under normal lighting, the codes are nearly invisible.

     After missing the correct response twice on a newly arrived game employing tiny print on such a red background, I was carping about "protection that spoils player enjoyment ...", when Gorbash turned from a nearby computer and suggested: "Maybe you could bleach it out."  Well, when an M.I.T. chemistry Doctor of Science says "try bleach", you try bleach. Viola! A dip in a tray of Purex plus some drying/flattening between paper towels in an old magazine and the job is done. (Warning: bleach is bad stuff; so, be careful.)  The red is gone and blue print stands out clearly on a light-yellow background. Magic!

** Keef the Thief **

Keef 'Visits' YOCS

     Boy was that close! Ye Olde Computists' Scroll Shoppe must have more traps than the Tel Mercon treasury. Now, to see if it was worth the trouble ...

The first scroll reads "After what she says, this may sound dippy: to please the Princess, think like a hippy!

The second scroll says "North, South, or West, Mem Santi Maze drives you mad, at best. To find Mem's First, young man, go East. That way there's a chance at least." (Gosh, what really excellent poetry!)


Your last prize isn't a scroll at all, just a rolled-up yellow legal pad sheet with some crude notes: "You always see an orange flash when you walk into a wall, right? Uh uh, not if the wall conceals a secret door!" and "Talk to the Smith in TM to find out about guards and bridges." and "Check out Al Handratta's hut near the sea in the southeast."

** Might & Magic II **

M&M II Finale

     From Gorbash, Goo-Goo, Igmo, ... (i.e. my dad) comes a pair of hints that could save your "Might and Magic II" party a bunch of grief as you near ultimate victory:

1. The last puzzle requires you to translate an eight-letter word into its coded version using a famous document excerpt (in code) as your guide. So, if the word is "Freedoms" (it isn't), you might reasonably win with something like "XJKKAHLV", right? No way! "Xjkkahlv" is a better try. (Preserve the case or face disgrace!)

2. If you've been playing on a speeded IIe or IIgs set to FAST, then beware. The last puzzle is timed via a program software loop. At FAST, the ten minutes normally allowed shrinks to about four! Before booting the game for the 'big push' (i.e. you know the password and are ready to tackle The Island), setting speed to NORMAL could make all the difference.

** Miscellaneous SSI AD&D Buglets **

     Lest a new player be concerned that "Something is wrong with my computer", it is worth noting that, indeed, some of SSI's AD&D games do exhibit a few glitches. You do not, for example, always get a "Keep" option when selling gems and jewelry; and, "Sell" sometimes switches to "Join". Occasionally, your inputs for Platinum to be Traded are ignored; a few non-critical artifacts don't work as advertised; early adventures failed to warn that elves cannot be resurrected; etc.. To these you can add the absence of a map for Level 3 of the Mines in the 'Silver Blades Clue Book (Level 1 is repeated)-- all in all, fairly minor stuff which is 'nice to know about', but does not seriously impact enjoyment. ("Easy for you to say; none of YOUR characters is an elf!" True.)

     Returning to 'Silver Blades: there is at least one piece of documentation which approaches bug-by-omission status. You may "Join" (combine) spell scrolls into 10-scroll bundles. This can easily put 20-30 major attack spells at the ready disposal of each magic user-- a factor which drastically affects game strategy. Yet, the feature is mentioned only as a brief note on the last fold of the "Data Card".

     A more serious bug turned up in Champions of Krynn. Here the protection scheme uses references to passages in the "'Journal", instead of an 'Infotator'-type code wheel. The problem is that, perhaps once in every ten game starts, you will be asked to type in "Word #116 of Journal entry #207", etc.. Well, aside from the ridiculous requirement of counting 116 words, there is no Journal entry #207!

     With a little experimentation (you get three tries at the right answer), my dad and I came up with two words that seem to work most of the time: KNOW and HELP. (You may need to reboot once or twice to get a protection check which will accept one of these words.)  Altogether (i.e. over the life of the game), the bug probably cost me no more than four or five reboots.

** Pool of Radiance **

No Clue in the Pool?

     Responding to various rumors, SSI's Linda Blanchard notes that there is currently no plan to supply free Clue Books with any of the TSR D&D adventures.

     Regarding David Stewart's observation that Pool of Radiance left him wandering and victoryless: Yes, due largely to the piecemeal nature of the quest (i.e. you are supposed to clear the city of Evil), POR is known for its unspectacular ending. So long as you do not expect any fireworks, you will have a pretty good idea when to declare Victory in POR.  (Besides, the adventure continues in a sequal!)

     As to being able to wander around after winning: this is an on-purpose feature of TSR adventures. Characters on the verge of Level promotion can gain experience and advance in preparation for the next adventure.



Pool Cues

     For those currently enmeshed in Pool of Radiance here are a few doplets of information which may prove useful.


I. The Bishop's Volunteer

     At some point you will visit Bishop Braccio (near the temple just east of City Hall). He will offer the services of a Level 6 cleric named Dirten who will join your party to help clean out the Temple of Bane.

     Needless to say, Dirten is a valuable addition, particularly since his Lawful Good alignment means that he won't turn tail or backstab your characters in the heat of battle. Unfortunately, if he is in on the Temple of Bane mission, he will (according to the Clue Book) leave your party once the job is done.

     I happened to visit the Bishop AFTER clearing Bane's temple of evil doers and gromming the treasures (I had not, however, destroyed the alter); yet old Braccio made the same offer! Since there was a vacant character slot, I accepted and discovered that Dirten is perfectly willing to stick with the party to the end.



II. New Alignments for Old

     Evidently, the fighter NPC's (non-player characters) you can hire at the Dueling Hall always come with a Lawful Evil alignment. To make this "Chaotic Good", change byte $D8 in the character's descriptor block from $02 to $06. ($00 for Lawful Good, etc.. The values follow the same order as the "Alignments" listing on page 5 of the game manual.)  If playing on a IIe, you can modify on-diskette character data (see T. Rapheld's article in Issue #70).

     On a IIgs, the easiest approach is to make changes directly to memory during play. Just install the Visit Monitor CDA (Call -151 and enter #) before booting. (Or, you can boot a diskette which installs DSR's Diversi Hack.)

     Once the game is running and you are walking around town, do an OpenApple-CTRL-ESC and select "Visit Monitor" from the Control Panel. Find the block for your NPC (e.g. "Hero") which should begin somewhere between $4400 and $4F00 and enter the new alignment (e.g. $4AD8:06).

     This is also a good time to give your NPC a real name (e.g. replace "HERO" $4A00:48 45 52 4F 00 ... with $4A00:4D 4F 54 48 4E 4F 53 45 00 ... for "MOTHNOSE", etc.). CTRL-Y returns you to the Control Panel where selecting "Quit" puts you back in the game.

Note: Whenever modifying characters as above, be sure the target character is not currently selected (e.g. being VIEWed, etc.) when you go to the control panel. The program maintains a status buffer for a VIEWed character which, once you return to the game, may over-write any changes. Hence, the suggestion that you interrupt play while in 'Exploration mode' (movement using I, J, K, M keys).


III. Super Weapon?

     Somewhere along the way, perhaps during the mission to clear the Valhingen Graveyard, I came upon a "+2 Two-handed Sword". The item went unnoticed until the usual post-mission visit to the Armor Shop, where a "Sell" check produced an offer of 20,000+ gold! THEN I observed that the "+2" did not, as usual, follow the item name.

     Tests indicate that it is not a sword or even a weapon. It is a magical artifact which grants a brief enormous increase (when you USE it) in the wielder's hitpower-- perfect for the big showdown with The Boss. (Unfortunately, my experiments wasted the phantom sword's power. You, however, can be on the look-out for the item and put it to better use.)


IV. Endgame

     Finally, you are dispatched (on a special mission from a councilman) to help the Forces of Good seize the Stowjanow Gates. After this success, you will be able to enter Valjevo Castle, wend and/or hack your way through a hedge maze, and take on The Boss in his two-story keep at the center. (See pictorial map on page 26 of the "'Journal".)


Strategy Hints

In the first part of the 'Final Battle', feel free to unload all of your mass-destruction spells on the elite guards. (They aren't much good against The Boss anyway.)

If you survive this fight, you'll have a chance to pick over some +3 Rings of Protection, heavy-duty Plate Armor, and at least one +5 Long Sword. Be sure to try the new stuff here (i.e. TAKE and then VIEW/READY items while checking changes in Armor Class and Damage).

Immediately after EXITing the TAKE routines, you will, at last, see the Pool of Radiance and face The Boss himself. One or two fighters armed with Fine (silver) Longbows and silver arrows are VERY helpful here. (You will have to be a fast reader to catch all of the message following victory. ALTERing speed to its slowest setting before the battles may be a good idea.)


     As noted earlier, adventure players accustomed to flashy displays, parades, coronations and other such celebrations are bound to find POR's ending a tad underwhelming. Lest there be any doubt, once Phlan is cleared of The Boss and his major minions, the City Clerk will hand over a pile of gems, some fairly hefty Experience bonuses, and tell you that you have completed The Quest.

** Realms of Darkness **

Light in the Realms

     Having polished off the first batch of quests in SSI's Realms of Darkness, your stalwart band is stymied. You know that a "Rogue Alliance" is stirring up trouble; but no one in Badel is handing out nice specific assignments. Then one day, in a desolate region just north of the city, your scout stumbles upon a hidden cave! Following a trail marked by flickering neon arrows you arrive at a brightly lit grotto in the center of which is a huge stone statue. At its feet a sign reads: "Ye Olde Computist's Oracle. Cross my palm with silver." Figuring that ANY chance to end your aimless wandering is worth taking, you plop the party's last silver denar into the figure's extended hand.

     With a horrendous groan the golem closes its fist upon the coin and begins to speak in a deep rumbling voice:

    "Questless in Badel? Not at all!
     To destroy the Rogue Alliance is the call.

     First, three quests for Shapes.
     Then, on the Star, a spell is bound;
     and teleport to another ground.

     One maze here? Yes, but toggles too.
     Enter a room past Gertrude's sign
     and map Level two a second time!

     Back to Badel, then North and down
     you pursue the Bones of Dragon.

     The Eight-legged Guardian passes just one.
     Pull, stone grinds, and the way is done.

     Rejoined and confused?
     A new doorway is used!

     Down a long corridor, past many alcoves you lead;
     and a mapper exclaims "Aha! 'Bones' indeed!"

     First, a hero's treasure;
     then East to take your magic's measure.

     Against a Rogues army second to none,
     Reflect early
     and Realms' greatest quest is won!"

** Spellbreaker **

Spellbreaker Break (Rating Change: **)

     Third in Infocom's legendary "Enchanter Trilogy", Spellbreaker (for 64K Apple II) casts you as the new leader of the Circle of Enchanters-- owing to your brilliancies in Enchanter and Sorcerer-- facing an ominous new threat to the very existence of magic. The all-text adventure easily earned three stars after my dad and I enjoyed many hours of challenging play.

     However, we had not finished the game and have, since, discovered a fairly significant bug! At some point in the adventure you will need an item (one of the cubes) obtained from a hermit at the cliff top. To get there you must stop an avalanche via the GIRCOL (time freeze) spell scroll. If you have used up the scroll to handle some earlier problem, you are likely to, eventually, find yourself 99% of the way through the adventure with no hope of winning!

     I finally checked the Clue Book-- something I have never before done for one of the "Enchanter" adventures. Its comment about wasting GIRCOL (on page 6) is: "Bad Move". No kidding! With luck, you may have to replay 'only' 80% of the game to correct the error you committed due to an ESP deficit.

     This sort of thing isn't supposed to happen in an Infocom product. If you need GIRCOL to solve the cliff puzzle, you should not be able to waste it somewhere else.

     Spellbreaker remains a fine adventure; and, now that the bug has been exposed, you can avoid the problem. Still, such flaws weaken the trust essential for enjoyment of puzzle-intensive adventuring. ("I've gotten this far. There MUST be a solution!")  Hence, the new (one star less) rating.

** Ultima V **

Wombala's Wonderful Walk

     Okay, so you've made it into the dungeon at the center of "Ultima V"'s Underworld only to encounter THE insoluble room. (i.e. You know there is an exit; but it's sealed or there's 'no way' to reach it). Not to worry. If you are on a IIGS with "Diversi Hack" or "Visit Monitor" installed, then Wombala's Wonderful Walk is at your disposal. Named for a sorcerer of the ancient Zulu empire, this realtime map-diddling spell replaces rocks, water, etc. with nice firm ground. When in the room, just do a CMD-CTRL-ESC, select Visit or Hack, go to the monitor and enter 800.878 (RETURN) to display the 121 bytes of the current 11x11 room map. $FF's are blanks, $4D's are rocks, etc.. Now type-in $05's wherever you want open ground; return to the game; and, ZAVOOMBA!, your Wonderful Walk is ready.

** Wizardry III **

Keeping the Wiz in Wiz III

    "THAT piece'", Gorbash commented, "has been invaluable."  The article to which he referred is John Wiegley's description of how to transfer characters from earlier Wizardrys to Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn

     Having 'gotten into' Sir Tech's new Trilogy package re-release (64K Apple II version), Gorbash had completed Knight of Diamonds only to encounter Wiz III's infamous 'spirit barrier'. Normally, developed characters do not truly transfer to Wiz III. Instead, your Legacy guys are supposed to be descendants of earlier heroes. Via a Rite of Passage they undergo a kind of 'spirit transfer' to acquire the "memories and skills" (and names) of Wiz I/II characters.

     Fair enough. It HAS been a long, long time since the legendary Knight of Diamonds quest. Alas, spirit transfer technology has a long way to go; The Rite slashes hard-won attributes and rips off possessions.

     JW's technique gets your guys into the Legacy scenario, too; but, in tact!  The first step is to go through the standard Wiz III character transfer to an initialized disk. (Do _not_, however, attempt the Rite of Passage.)  Using Copy II Plus's Sector Editor, the 'trick' is to find the last byte in each character's information block, add $20, and substitute the resulting value.

     The problem is that finding the last byte isn't always such a simple matter. Some blocks are split and the second part may not be in an adjacent sector.

     To simplify things, we finally went back to Wizardry II: Knight of Diamonds, rested-up/spelled-up the characters, and noted Level, Hit Points (current & max), plus any mage and priest spell counts (e.g. "9/9/9/9/9/7/5 ...") and current Armor Class. As shown in Rob Hall's "Wizardry" character block break-down (Computist #40, page 25-- another invaluable Wiz resource!), these numbers appear in the latter part of the block:

 Level at $84, $85
 Hit Points (current) at $86, $87
 Hit Points (max) at     $88, $89
 Mage spells (2-byte counts for each spell level 1-7)   at $92-$9F
 Priest spells (2-byte counts for each spell level 1-7) at $A0-$AD
 current Armor Class at  $B0, $B1


     After exiting Wiz II, we booted Copy II Plus, hopped to the Sector Editor, and used known character numbers (e.g. Level, etc.) to track down the second parts of split blocks. For example ...

Suppose Rev Gun's block shows up as starting at byte $B0 on the Sector Editor display for Track $1A, Sector $00. (You see "REV GUN" in flashing letters.)

Each "block" is $D0 bytes long; so, you know $50 bytes are here and the last $80 bytes of the block are somewhere else. If Rev Gun ended "Wiz' II'" with 283 Hit Points, then (if he left with current HP= max HP), you might SCAN for hex bytes 1B 01 1B 01 ($011B in hexadecimal = 283). Track $19, Sector $00 is a safe place to start, since character block storage seems to begin around Track $1A.

When Copy II Plus finds the numbers, you can use other character numbers to verify that, for sure, this is the rest of Rev Gun's block. Some 'good try' places to look for block continuations include Track/Sectors $1A/$0F, $1B/$00, $1B/$0B, $1B/$0C, $1B/0E.


     The creators of Wizardry III were concerned with the problem of designing a challenge appropriate for heroes which may come from either Wiz I or Wiz II. They have come up with a fairly plausible device for re-leveling the 'playing field'. The question is: just how much re-leveling are you willing to accept? Is the "legacy" of your new characters merely names and memories OR does it also include developed powers and a pile of hardware?!

** Wizardry V **

NOT a Bug

     Some years back, my dad caught what appeared to be a sure bug in the original "Ultima": when an attribute's value increments beyond 99, it resets to zero. Well, we called Richard Garriot/ Lord British and were told that the recyclying is, most certainly, not a bug. No indeed, Richard explained, it is a "feature" intended "to keep players from being too greedy".

     Evidently, there are many fewer bugs and many more features floating around than one might suppose. Last month I reported an apparent "Wizardry V" bug which produces unexpected Good-to-Evil shifts in orientation. Since the game does not permit forming a party including both Good and Evil members (though, interestingly, it will not boot out misfits at the time the shift occurs), the result can be the loss of valuable personnel. A problem? Yes. A bug? No. 

     According to Sir Tech's Brenda Garno, when the manual says: "Certain peaceful monster types may offer your party a truce" (p.58), it is referring to those times you encounter messages such as "You see a wandering group of Arch Devils  Attack/Leave alone". Choosing to attack is viewed as evidence of evil inclinations. (Like, clearly, you'd have to be really corrupt to beat-up on "peaceful" Arch Devils.)  Due to a random factor, just one such attack may trigger a shift; or, it may take several.


Wiz V: Kettles & False Mazes

     Dr. Hackenbush's question in #68 provoked a look through my "Wizardry V" notes, and, very probably, has re-hooked me on finishing the quest. This IS one of the great adventures.

     As to where to find the Laughing Kettle: on Level I at coordinates 22 East, 23 North, there is a secret door in the north wall which leads to the Kettle. He offers some useful clues for prices ranging from $500 through $5000. (Incidentally, don't be fooled by his jolly appearance. If attacked, the Kettle proves to be tough, powerful magic user; AND, should you win, the temple healers will require that you pay for his resurrection!)

     The "false mazes" encountered by some "Wiz' V" players ARE very strange places (places, in fact, where you are not supposed to be); but the phenomenon is not the result of some bug. (In the first batch of "Wizardry V" packages shipped, some did have bad diskettes-- quickly replaced by Sir Tech-- but, these simply crashed the game.)

     Rather, the false maze problem stems from player errors which go undetected because 'correct diskette' verification is limited, mainly, to occasions when you move from one level to another. For example, if you take an elevator to Level 3, the program will insist that Level 3's diskette be in place before play continues.

     If, once on Level 3, you should swap in Level 5's diskette, the program will try to construct a maze from (and do updates to!) whatever it finds. Naturally, the Level 5 'player copy' diskette is ruined; and you find yourself in an oddly 'inside-out' maze which can look just genuine enough to occupy your best mapping skills for an hour or so.

     My excursion into a false maze began when, using Roger Wagner's "Soft Switch" (on a IIgs), I decided to jump back to an earlier position on another level and forgot to swap in the new level's diskette. Well, the program had no way of knowing that some sly user was playing fast and loose with the adventure. It went merrily along, reading from and WRITING TO the other level's diskette; I ended up mapping a hefty chunk of "Wizardry V"'s 'twilight zone', and the diskette side was bombed.

     A reasonably satisfactory cure is to get out your set of originals and recopy the side that's been damaged. Everything on the restored level will be reset-- you may have to reopen a few locks, etc.-- but, at least, the quest can continue.

WARNING:  THIS WALK-THRU SHOWS HOW TO SOLVE THIS ADVENTURE STEP BY STEP, THESE
ARE NOT HINTS!

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE ENCLOSED IN QUOTES, SO TYPE WHAT YOU SEE.

START OFF BY GOING "N".  YOU ARE NOW STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A
SMALL BRICK BUILDING.  THIS BUILDING IS THE WELLHOUSE, AND IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

CONTINUE WITH "DROP CAGE", "SW", "W".  HERE IS A DRAGON SITTING ON A PERSIAN
RUG.  YOU NEED TO KILL THE DRAGON TO GET THE RUG SO TYPE "KILL DRAGON".  THE
GAME WILL RESPOND WITH "WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?".  ANSWER "YES".
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE NOW KILLED THE DRAGON!.  SO, "GET RUG", THEN "E",
"E", "S", "GET JEWELRY", "N", "W", "GET COINS", "E", "N", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND
"PLUGH".  YOU ARE AGAIN BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP YOUR TREASURES WITH
"DROP DIAMONDS", "DROP GOLD", "DROP RUG", "DROP JEWELRY", "DROP COINS".  BACK
TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET FOOD", "GET KEYS", "GET
BOTTLE", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W", THEN SAY "ORIENTAL" TO GET TO THE ORIENTAL
ROOM.  THEN "GET VASE", "W", "DROP KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "BACK", "N", "W", AND
YOU HAVE NOW FOUND THE EMERALD YOU PREVIOUSLY PLACED THERE.  SO "GET EMERALD",
"NW", "S", "SE", "E", "GET PILLOW".  THE PILLOW IS USED TO PLACE THE VASE ON,
SO YOU DON'T BREAK IT.

NOW GO "BACK", "W", "W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U".  THE PLANT IS CRYING FOR MORE
WATER, SO NOW YOU NEED TO GO GET IT SOME WATER.  BUT BEFORE YOU DO THAT DROP
OFF YOUR TREASURES AT THE WELL- HOUSE BY GOING "E", "E", "NE", "E", "U", "E",
"U", "N", "LAMP OFF", "PLUGH" AND YOU ARE BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE.  SO "DROP
PILLOW", "DROP VASE", "DROP EMERALD".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "E", "D", "FILL BOTTLE".
YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FILLED WITH WATER, SO GO "U", "W", "W", "D", "W", "W", "W",
"W", "D", "WATER PLANT", "U", "E", "D", "GET OIL", "U", "W", "D".  NOW YOU CAN
CLIMB THE BEANSTALK SO, "CLIMB", "W", "GET EGGS", "N", "OIL DOOR", "DROP
BOTTLE", "N", "GET TRIDENT", "W", "D", "DROP TRIDENT", "GET KEYS", "GET FOOD",
"SW", "U".  YOU ARE NOW IN FRONT OF A BRIDGE WITH A TROLL GUARDING IT.  THE
ONLY THING THAT WILL CAUSE THE TROLL TO LEAVE IS TO THROW HIM A TREASURE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE TREASURE YOU CAN THROW HIM AND THAT IS THE EGGS.  SO "THROW
EGGS", THEN "CROSS".

YOU ARE NOW ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE WITH "NE", "E", "NE", "E", "GET
SPICES", "W", "N", (HERE IS THE VOLCANO), "S", "S", "SE", "S", "IN".  YOU ARE
NOW IN A ROOM WITH A FEROCIOUS BEAR, WHO IS LOCKED UP WITH A GOLD CHAIN.  YOU
NEED TO GET THE CHAIN, SO "FEED BEAR", THEN "UNLOCK" THE CHAIN, "GET BEAR",
"GET CHAIN", "DROP KEYS", AND "OUT".  THE BEAR WILL NOW FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU
GO.  SO GO "U", "U", "W", "W", AND "CROSS".  FROM NOWHERE, THE TROLL APPEARS
AGAIN.	JUST "DROP BEAR", AND THE TROLL WILL DISAPPEAR.  NOW "CROSS" THE
BRIDGE, THEN GO "SW", "D", "GET TRIDENT", "SE", "SE", "NE", "E", "N".  YOU ARE
IN THE CLAM ROOM, SO NOW "OPEN CLAM".  (IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE TRIDENT
BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN THE CLAM).	NOW YOU NEED TO GO AFTER THE PEARL SO GO "D",
"D", "GET PEARL".  THEN "U", "U", "S", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND SAY
"PLUGH".  THEN "DROP CHAIN", "DROP PEARL", "DROP TRIDENT", "DROP SPICES".

BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "D", "W", "D", "W", "W",
"W", "W", "D", "CLIMB", "W".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT THE SPOT WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY
FOUND THE EGGS WHICH YOU THREW TO THE TROLL.  THE REASON YOU THREW THE EGGS WAS
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THEM BACK AGAIN!  JUST SAY "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FOO", AND
THEY MAGICALLY APPEAR!	SO "GET EGGS", THEN "N", "N", "W", "D", "SE", "SE",
"NE", "E", "U", "E", "U", "N", "LAMP OFF", AND "PLUGH".  THEN "DROP EGGS".

NOW ON TO FIND THE LAST TREASURE, THE PIRATE'S CHEST!  GO THERE WITH "PLUGH",
"LAMP ON", "E", "U", "W", "W", "W", "S", "E", "S", "S", "S", "N", "E", "E",
"NW", "GET CHEST", "BACK", "N", "D", "E", "E", "XYZZY".  YOU ARE BACK AT THE
BUILDING, SO "DROP CHEST".  CONGRATULATIONS, YOU NOW HAVE ALL 15 TREASURES!

AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE YOU GO THE THE GRAND
FINALE.  SO SAY "XYZZY", THEN GO "W", "W", "W", "D", "D", "N", "D", "W", "D",
"E", "GET MAGAZINES".  YOUR QUEST IS TO TAKE THE MAGAZINES, AND PLACE THEM JUST
INSIDE WITT'S END.  THIS ACTION IS OFTEN MISSED BY PEOPLE PLAYING THIS GAME,
AND AS A RESULT, THEY DO NOT FINISH THE GAME WITH ALL 350 POINTS AND THE GRAND
MASTER STATUS.	NOW GO "E", THEN "DROP MAGAZINES", AND "BACK".

NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

			Adventure - The Colossal Cave


1. Enter building. Get keys and lamp.  The lamp appears here should you have to 
be reincarnated.
2. Unlock gate (with key).  Get cage.
3. Try the magic word, XYZZY.  Try it again.  Get rod.
4. Drop rod. Get bird. Get rod.
5. Wave rod. Drop rod. Go get diamonds and gold.
6. Release bird. Drop cage. Grab coins and silver. Note: Dwarves are lousy 
shots, but sometimes, unfortunately, they can get lucky.  Carry the ax, as you 
may encounter up to five of these critters.
7. Try the magic word PLUGH also. Drop silver, gold nugget, diamonds, jewelry, 
and coins. If you haven't already, you will soon encounter a thieving pirate. 
Not to worry, he's got to rob you at least once if you're to win all the 
marbles.
8. Carrying food, ax, bottle of water, key (all for later) and lantern, visit 
the software den (Microsoft Version only). Don't mess with anything--Software 
types are a weird lot.  Get magic word LWPI.  Works only from here.
9. Water plant twice. Get water for the second pass at the waterfall.
10. Attack dragon. Yes. Get rug.
11. Get oil (in now empty bottle). Climb the plant.
12. Oil door. Open door. Drop bottle. While here and while carrying golden eggs, 
enter FEE, FIE, FOE, FOO, one word at a time. Check your inventory.  Go back to 
where you first found the eggs.
13. Throw eggs (to troll).  Cross bridge before the FEE, FIE, whatever.
14. Feed bear.  Unlock chain (with key).  Get golden chain. Drop key.  Get bear.  
Don't forget the rare spices.  At volcano view, read and remember the words of 
fire.
15. Release bear.  Don't try crossing the bridge with him on the chain.
16. Open oyster (with trident).  Pearl will roll down into the cul-de-sac.
17. Insert coin to get a replacement battery for your lamp, if necessary.  Coins 
are a treasure, however, and you won't ge them back, so try beating the game 
with the original batteries only.
18. Never drop vase unless you have already dropped the pillow.
19. Drop everything in order to enter.  Get emerald.
20. Say PLOVER.  Get pyramid.  PLOVER, PLUGH and pi-tooie!
21. You must traverse the maze to get Pirate's Treasure Chest, which doesn't 
appear until he's robbed you.  Return via the Pit and XYZZY.  Drop all treasures 
in the House.
22. Drop magazine in Witt's End for a point.  Get out by entering all different 
directions except north.  It may take a while.  Slog around in various and 
distant locations until a voice announces that the cave is now closed.  At this 
point you are teleported to the two-room Master's Game.
23. Get black rod (with the rusty marks, not the star).  Drop rod in the 
northeast room.  Retreat to the southwest room. Type blast. Alternate endings 
are possible, but will not yield sufficient points to earn you the rank of 
adventure grandmaster.

1. Let sleeping dragons lie, until much later. (Never go near him with any mud.)
2. In quicksand take only the ax.  Get ox.  Say Bunyon.  Swim south.  Go to 
Paul's place.  En route, get flint and steel.
3. Climb tree.  Get key.  Read web.  Chop tree.  May need mud for chigger bites.  
Go stump.  Start dumping treasures.  Rub lamp (Twice only) for two more.  With 
the rubies directly below, there should now be five.  Take bottle.
4. Unlock door.  Drop keys.  Go hallway.  Light lamp with flint and steel.  If 
lamp dies, fill with oily slime.
5. In maze, get rug and net.  With rug, get out by say away (twice) to transport 
back to the meadow.
6. At lake with filled bottle and net, catch fish. (Fish die without bottle.)
7. Get wine bladder.  Fill bladder (with swamp gas).  In royal chamber, drop 
bladder.  Burn bladder.

9. Dam lava with bricks.  Pour water.  Get firestone.
10. In beehive, with rug, mud, and empty bottle, catch bees.  Take honey.  Drop 
mud.  Go meadow.  Release bees.  Get dragon eggs.  (Can make it 50% of the time 
before Bees die, but using rug and say away is easier.)  After dropping all 
thirteen treasures, say score.  The treasure summary:
	Blue Ox			Golden Fish		Golden Net
	Jeweled Fruit		Diamond Ring		Bracelet
	Rubies			Rug			Magic Mirror
	Golden Crown		Royal Honey		Firestone
	Dragon Eggs

Before  you start to play this adventure, read the documentation thoroughly
so that you have an idea of what is going on and who you are.

The  game  itself  is very strange. There are actually very few problems. A
lot of the adventure is a mapping exercise!

PART ONE.
You  start  the adventure just after your awakening, being told by Perelman
that  the  simulation  to  test  the  plan can begin soon. Note the various
communications outlets at your disposal.

"PEOF"; you are now in Perelman's office. "Wait" till Perelman says you can
now  enter  simulation  mode.  The Social Science group wants you to record
several  things  which are listed for you. "Enter simulation"; use the code
wheel  from  the  packaging and you find yourself 10 years in the future in
Kennedy Park.

This  first  section  is to familiarise yourself with recording and also to
let  you  map  the  area.  This  map  will  form the basis for other future
simulations.   In  some  cases,  there  are  several  ways  to  record  the
information  required  in this simulation eg eating a meal in a restaurant,
as  there  are  several  you  can  visit. If your record buffer should fill
before  you  have  recorded  everything  you  want,  just "abort, PEOF, ask
Perelman  to look at recordings" and when he returns, he will tell you want
else he wants recorded.

The recording required are as follows.
(1)Eating  a  meal in a restaurant. Go to one, eg Roy's Pagoda. "Record on,
buy meal, record off".
(2)  Talking to a government official. Go to City Hall, "record on, talk to
official, record off".
(3)  Visiting  a  power-generating  facility.  Go  into  the power station,
"record  on,  look,  record  off".  (4) Reading a newspaper. Go to Bodanski
Square, "buy newspaper, record on, read newspaper, record off".
(5)  Riding  some  form  of  public  transportation.  Go down into the tube
system,  wait till a tubecar arrives. "Record on, enter tubecar, wait" till
the tubecar stops, "leave tubecar, record off".
(6)  Attending  a  court  in  session. Go into the court. "Record on, look,
record off".
(7) Talking to a church official. Go into a church eg St Michael's, "record
on, talk to elder, record off".
(8) Going to a movie. Go to the cinema , "record on, buy ticket, in, record
off".  (9)  Visiting  your  own  home  or living quarters. "Inventory, open
wallet,  read  licence"; you now know your address is Parkview Appartments,
Southway.  Go  there,  "unlock  door,  w,  unlock door, record on, n, look,
record off".

"Abort,  PEOF,  ask  Perelman  to  look at recordings". So long as you have
recorded  all  the  things  required, he will tell you that the experts are
pleased  and  it  looks  as though the Plan will be adopted. As a result of
your recordings, more accurate simulations will be possible in future.


PART 2.
At  the  start  of  this section, you will be asked to do some psych tests.
This is just a bit of fun, the answers don't mean anything so you can reply
whatever you want!

In  a  while,  Perelman  tells  you  the plan has been recommended for full
adoption  in  a  few weeks. But he says he has a funny feeling about it. If
you  "enter  simulation mode" now, you can go to either 10 or 20 years into
the future. So go into 20 (2051).

If you have a look around, you will see several things have changed and the
situation seems to be deteriorating. Record anything like this that you can
see  and every so often, return and show them to Perelman. If he wants more
recordings, go back into the simulation. Some things you can do are: "look"
at  Rockvil Reformatory, talk to the elder in the church, read a newspaper.
Go to the old station, it is now the Church of God's Word. "Look" there and
read  the  pamphlet.  Visit  the  soup  kitchen, Heiman's World, the police
station,  your  own  appartment.  Go  to  Huang Hall, the city dump, skycar
factory, courthouse.

When  you have spent enough time in the simulation and recorded enough, you
will  find a new simulation, 30 years into the future, is available. Do the
same  here  (2061).  Some useful recording for 2061 are: spend some time in
your  appartment  and  have  a  good look round, the soup kitchen, the city
dump,  the  skycar  factory,  Church  Street  Park,  the Health Centre, the
church,  read  the  pamphlet in the Church of God's Word, visit the school,
the  stadium,  the  reformatory  and Huang Hall. Go to Kennedy Park and the
airport terminal. Various incidents also happen on the streets.

In  a  similar  way, spending time and recording enough here will open a 40
year  simulation into 2071. Again, record changes and things that happen in
the  street. Visit your appartment, the zoo, read the banner in the zoo, go
to  the  aquarium,  fire  station,  stadium, bank, athletic field, airport,
cinema.

These  are  just  some  of  the  places  you  can  go  in  each simulation.
Eventually,  Perelman  asks  you  to  visit the last simulation in 2081, 50
years  in the future, to see if everything turns around. This simulation is
very  small and dangerous. Go into the inn, onto the bridge over the river,
examine the sack there, get eaten by dogs, or killed when you enter certain
locations.
Show  these  recordings to Perelman. He says the plan must be cancelled and
he's going to Washington!

PART 3.
At  the  start of this section, you're informed that a WNNF device is about
to  be  added to your auxiliary systems and will be online in 4 or 5 hours.
Perelman  returns  and  tells  you  that  he's  been  accused of faking the
recordings.  He goes to meet some colleagues. There is also a message given
to you that the complex has been sealed for security reasons.

"PEOF" and "wait" in Perelman's office. When Ryder enters, "record on"; you
make a recording of him threatening Perelman. Then Perelman is taken away.

Now  go  to  the  roof  with  "RCRO".  "Wait"  till some men arrive. "Enter
interface  mode"  and  "HVAC  controller,  turn  off  ventilation  in delta
sector".  "Enter communications mode, MACO"; in a while, the men arrive and
start  working  on  one  of  the  conditioning units that house your brain.
Eventually, the build up of fumes caused by you turning off the ventilation
causes them to pass out. This saves you from being killed.

Now  wait  till  the WNN feeder is active (check by entering interface mode
and  looking at the active ports). When it is, "WNN feeder, transmit record
buffer,  enter  communication  mode, WNNF"; you see your recording of Ryder
threatening  Perelman  being  broadcast,  thus  discrediting  Ryder and his
Plan!

Wait  till  Perelman  contacts you telling you Ryder has fled. The plan has
been cancelled and you're a hero!

You now have one final simulation to enter and enjoy..........

  A. You get de-activated for several different reasons.
  B. One reason: you refused to enter Simulation Mode despite repeated
     requests.
  C. Another: you refused to go to Perelman's office when summoned.
  D. A third: you messed up some of the settings in Interface Mode after
     being warned by Perelman not to do so again.

Why does RECORD not work at times?
  A. RECORD will not function in the Epilogue, nor in any mode other than
     Simulation or Communication.
  B. You can't RECORD if the record buffer is full. (See the record buffer
     question in the section on Part I.)
  C. You can't RECORD if Perelman is viewing your recordings.

What is the significance of the psych test in Part II?
  A. Dr. Grimwold is continuing to collect data to monitor your mental
     condition.
  B. Have you noticed that you can give virtually any answer during the
     test, even really bizarre ones, and Grimwold reacts the same way?
  C. The ink blots are pretty, aren't they?
  D. There's no other significance. It's basically a red herring.

How does curfew work?
  A. Curfew is in effect during the 2051, 2061 and 2071 simulations.
  B. It begins and ends with sirens at 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., respectively.
  C. It's dangerous to be outside during curfew.


Communications Mode
*******************

How do I move from location to location in Communications Mode?
  A. Just use the four-letter code associated with each communication
     outlet.
  B. For example, to "move" to the Cafeteria, type PCAF.

How can I see the list of communication outlets?
     Just type READ LIST OF COMMUNICATION OUTLETS. If you're in Comm Mode,
     but not connected to any specific outlet, you can just LOOK to see the
     list.

Is the World News communication outlet useful? Does the news ever change?
  A. The news outlet provides background information, to familiarize you
     with the world of 2031.
  B. That's all.
  C. You should probably "watch" all 30 minutes of news.
  D. The news changes daily (at midnight).
  E. There are different news programs on March 16th, 17th and 19th. On the
     18th, the news is pre-empted by a special report. After the 19th, the
     news is always interrupted due to satellite maintenance.

Is the Cafeteria important?
  A. You can watch the size of the crowds change during various times of the
     day.
  B. Perelman and Randu agree to meet for lunch in the Cafeteria.
  C. But you can't see them. They must sit in the section of the Cafeteria
     out of your view.
  D. The Cafeteria isn't important.

Is the Maintenance Core important?
  A. You can see a lot of the machinery which makes up your physical body.
  B. Such as your cooling units.
  C. The Maintenance Core is an important location in Part III.
  D. See the question about dying in Part III.

Is the communications outlet in Perelman's office useful?
  A. You can watch Perelman come and go.
  B. When Perelman is in his office, you can talk to him via this outlet.
     This outlet and the Control Center outlet are the only places where you
     can talk to Perelman.
  C. This outlet is also important later in the story.
  D. See the question about the goal of Part III.

How about the Control Center -- is that outlet important?
  A. You can watch Perelman come and go.
  B. When Perelman is in the Control Center, you can talk to him via this
     outlet. This outlet and the outlet in his office are the only places
     where you can talk to Perelman.
  C. You can see National Guardsmen stationed outside the door in Part III.
  D. That's about it.

Does the communication outlet on the rooftop have any significance?
  A. This is your only outdoor outlet.
  B. You can watch the passing of the days from here: sunrises and sunsets,
     rush-hour traffic, the nighttime glow of Rockvil on the horizon.
  C. This outlet is briefly important during Part III.
  D. See the question about dying in Part III.


Library Mode
************

I don't understand the structure of Library Mode.
     There are a number of directories in Library Mode, and each directory
     contains a number of data files.

How can I access the information in Library Mode?
  A. Read the menu that appears on your screen in Library Mode. All inputs
     in Library Mode are one-character only -- pressing the RETURN (or
     ENTER) key is unnecessary.
  B. Use P (previous) and N (next) to select the directory or data file
     you're interested in. A ">" cursor points to the "current" one.
  C. When your screen is showing the list of directories, O (open) will
     display a list of the data files within the current directory.
  D. When your screen is showing the contents of a directory, R (read) will
     display the contents of the current data file. C (close) will return
     you to the list of directories.
  E. At any point in Library Mode, E (exit) will put you in Communications
     Mode.

Are Perelman's "resignation letter" and "list of things to do" supposed to
end so abruptly?
     Yes.

What do I need to do in Library Mode?
  A. Have you read all the data files?
  B. That's about it. Library Mode is just a source of information.
  C. Additional data files will appear in Library Mode as the story
     progresses...
  D. ...such as when you receive messages, or when new devices are added to
     Interface Mode.


Interface Mode
**************

What is the purpose of Interface Mode?
  A. It allows you to communicate with various auxiliary computers that are
     connected to you.
  B. The status reports can provide some interesting information.
  C. For example: SIMULATION CONTROLLER, STATUS will tell you how much time
     you've spent in a particular simulation, and how much space is left in
     the record buffer.
  D. Interface Mode is also useful for solving a few puzzles in the story.
  E. You'll find out more when you get to those specific puzzles.

How can I read the List of Active Ports?
     Try READ THE LIST OF ACTIVE PORTS, or simply LIST ACTIVE PORTS.


Sleep Mode
**********

I'm a computer! Why should I require sleep?
     Although your body doesn't get tired, your mind requires the
     therapeutic experience of sleep. Also, you're used to sleeping -- you
     "grew up" sleeping every day!

When _can_ I enter Sleep Mode?
  A. You can enter Sleep Mode if it's been at least six hours since your
     last sleep.
  B. If your last sleep was interrupted, such as by an incoming message, you
     will be able to enter Sleep Mode in less than six hours.
  C. If your sleep is interrupted after less than an hour, you can begin
     sleeping again immediately.

When _must_ I enter Sleep Mode?
  A. There's no point at which you are required to enter Sleep Mode.
  B. If you need to wait a long time, such as for Perelman to arrive in the
     morning, entering Sleep Mode is a bit faster than WAITing.

Is there any significance to the dreams while sleeping?
  A. Your dreams reflect memories of your simulated life.
  B. No significance.
  C. +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |              >>This space intentionally left blank.<<               |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Can I talk to my parents in the dream?
  A. Your mother is too busy trying to put out the fire.
  B. Your father can't hear you above the wind.
  C. There is no dream with your parents, nor any dream in which you are
     given an input prompt! Remember the warning in the introduction about
     fake questions.

Is there any reason to stay in Sleep Mode after waking?
     No.


Simulation Mode
***************

When can I enter Simulation Mode?
   A. In Part I, you'll be able to enter when you get the message from
      Perelman telling you to do so.
   B. After that, you'll generally be able to enter Simulation Mode whenever
      you want.

How can I get past the security code protection for Simulation Mode?
  A. Use the security decoder wheel from your _AMFV_ package.
  B. Turn your wheel until the color indicated in the security message is
     showing in the decoder window. On the inner wheel, find the number
     indicated in the security message. Read the corresponding number from
     the outer wheel. Enter that number (and hit the RETURN or ENTER key).


Part I
******

What is my goal in Part I?
  A. If you've read the documentation, it should be obvious.
  B. Various library files should be helpful also.
  C. If you still haven't figured it out, the message from Dr. Perelman
     about half an hour into the story should be a dead giveaway.
  D. You must enter Simulation Mode and make the recordings that Dr.
     Perelman asks for, in order to test the validity of the Plan. This is
     why you were "awoken" ahead of schedule.

How do I find those things I'm supposed to record in the simulation of 2041?
  A. You should thoroughly explore Rockvil, making a detailed map of the
     city. Remember that the map from your _AMFV_ package is only a tourist
     map, not highly detailed. Furthermore, it was printed in 2030, and
     you're now in 2041.
  B. The government official can be found in City Hall, off Rockvil Centre.
     The courthouse is at the corner of Elm and Park. The power station is
     near the river on River Street. You can get a newspaper from the
     dispenser at Bodanski Square. A church official can be found at either
     church. The Cinema is off Bodanski near the Railroad Museum. There are
     four different restaurants where you can get a meal, and eight
     different locations from which to enter the subway system.

My record buffer is full, but I still have stuff to record. What can I do?
  A. When Perelman views your recordings, he always empties the record
     buffer.
  B. You can return to Simulation Mode over and over without penalty.

Where do I live and how do I find it?
  A. Have you ever done an inventory to see what you're carrying in
     Simulation Mode?
  B. Have you ever examined your wallet?
  C. Opened it?
  D. Read the cards in your wallet?
  E. You live somewhere along Southway, obviously.
  F. It's at the corner of Southway and Park.
  G. Your key opens both the front door and the apartment door.

How can I get a newspaper out of the dispenser?
  A. See hints A through C of the previous question.
  B. Have you ever examined the dispenser?
  C. You can buy a paper by typing PUT CREDIT CARD IN DISPENSER.
  D. Or simply, BUY NEWSPAPER.

How can I get into the theatre of the Cinema?
  A. At the Cinema lobby, just say IN...
  B. ...once you've bought a ticket...
  C. ...which you can do by typing BUY TICKET.


Part II
*******

What is my goal in Part II?
  A. Don't look at these hints until you've begun Part II.
  B. Your goal won't be spelled out, as it was in Part I.
  C. Personally, do you have confidence in the Plan?
  D. Perelman's speech at the end of Part I contains a hint.
  E. Via Interface Mode, get a status report from the Simulation Controller.
     (SIMULATION CONTROLLER, STATUS.)
  F. The Simulation Controller has correlated so much data for 2041 that it
     can now provide a simulation for 2051 as well.
  G. If you enter Simulation Mode now, you'll be able to go to 2041 _or_
     2051. Explore 2051 for a while.
  H. You may notice that not everything is going as well as in 2041. If you
     were in 2051 for more than 300 minutes, you may notice something else.
  I. Specifically, that a 2061 simulation is now available!
  J. Spending over 400 minutes in 2061 will make a 2071 simulation possible.
     Spending over 600 minutes in that simulation will make a 2081
     simulation possible!
  K. By the time you get to the simulation of 2081, which is very deadly and
     limited to six locations, it's quite apparent that the Plan is a dismal
     failure. Don't you want to let people know?
  L. Use the same mechanism that you used in Part I.
  M. The RECORD feature.
  N. Record various things that seem onerous to you. Then show the
     recordings to Perelman. (SHOW RECORD BUFFER TO PERELMAN, TELL ABE ABOUT
     THE RECORDINGS, etc.)
  O. Perelman will want recordings from each simulation (2051 through 2081)
     in order to see the progressive breakdown of society under the Plan.
  P. Each "bad" sight or event that you can record has an internal "badness
     value." A complete listing of these, along with their value, can be
     found in the section entitled RECORDING "POINTS." To prove to
     Perelman's satisfaction that the Plan is bad, you must record sights
     and events totaling (at least) 11 points from 2051, 21 points from
     2061, 41 points from 2071, and 15 points from 2081. These badness
     points are internal to the program, invisible to you; Perelman will
     merely say things like "We want to see more from 2061."


Part III
********

What is my goal in Part III?
  A. Don't look at these hints until you've begun Part III.
  B. Watching and waiting is in order.
  C. A number of events take place that you'll have to deal with, and that
     might give you some ideas.
  D. Since the folks in Washington wouldn't believe Perelman, perhaps you'll
     have to figure out another way to stop the plan.
  E. Perhaps by discrediting it.
  F. Or one of its proponents.
  G. In Part III, Perelman returns from Washington. A short time later, the
     PRISM complex is sealed off by the National Guard.
  H. Try hanging around in Perelman's office after that.
  I. Does the visit by Senator Ryder give you any clues?
  J. Perelman gives you some very obvious hints during the Ryder visit.
  K. Such as asking Ryder if he wants "to go on the record" with that
     statement.
  L. What was the very first event in Part III?
  M. The first event is the notification that the WNN Feeder will soon be
     added to Interface Mode.
  N. You should RECORD the Ryder visit...
  O. ...and then broadcast it over the World News Network: WNN FEEDER,
     TRANSMIT RECORD BUFFER.
  P. Of course, you'll have to survive until the Feeder comes on line. See
     the next question.

What is this fever, this hot burning pain, that kills me in Part III?
  A. By exposing the defects of the Plan, you've gotten some pretty powerful
     people angry at you and worried about you.
  B. In Part III, there are a lot of things going on at a lot of different
     locations.
  C. For example, have you ever seen anything unusual on the rooftop or in
     the maintenance core?
  D. An hour or so after Ryder's visit, saboteurs arrive at the rooftop via
     skyvan, and travel to the Maintenance Core, where they sabotage your
     cooling units, eventually killing you.
  E. Everyone else is busy dealing with the siege; you'll have to deal with
     this problem on your own.
  F. Read the description of the maintenance core carefully.
  G. Zeeron fumes?
  H. Interface Mode is the key.
  I. Specifically, the HVAC Controller.
  J. Order the HVAC Controller to shut off the ventilation for delta sector.
     The saboteurs will quickly be knocked out by the zeeron fumes, and a
     short time later they'll be taken away by a National Guard patrol.


Part IV
*******

What is my goal in Part IV?
  A. Don't look at these hints until you've begun Part IV.
  B. What is the central event of Part IV?
  C. Perelman's funeral.
  D. Many important people will be there.
  E. Including the President.
  F. If you could request a communication outlet at the ceremony....
  G. There's no Part IV. Why are you developing these hints? Remember the
     warning in the introduction.

Is the visit by the WNN camera crew important?
  A. Yes.
  B. You have to be in a certain place at a certain time.
  C. That certain place is Hint C of this question, and that certain time is
     before you've gotten to Part IV...
  D. ...and the camera crew is important for teaching you not to look at the
     answers to questions you don't understand yet.


Epilogue
********

What is my goal in the Epilogue?
  A. There's not much you can do besides entering Simulation Mode.
  B. That will put you in a simulation of 2091, an idyllic world based on
     the program that replaced the Plan which you helped to discredit.
  C. Explore your new apartment, read the newspaper, and wait until the
     skycab arrives.
  D. This simulation, particularly the skycab trip, makes for some
     interesting comparisons with the futures based on the Plan.
  E. The epilogue is just your reward for finishing the story. There aren't
     any goals or puzzles to solve. Just sit back and enjoy it.

Recording "Points"
******************
(use only as a last resort)

Notes:
    If an event or sight is the same in two or more different years, you get
  credit for it only the first time you record it. For example, if you
  recorded a closed orphanage in 2061, the associated internal recording
  points would be credited to 2061, for the benefit of Perelman's evaluation
  of your recordings. If the orphanage was also closed in 2071, recording
  the fact would have an effect only if you hadn't already recorded it in
  2061.
    The following listing has such events and sights listed only under the
  simulation years during which they first appear or appear differently.

2051:

                THE EARTH: A LIVING WASTELAND

Where humans once danced and played, mutated apparitions now roam in
eternal torment.

	Where flowers and trees once thrived, plant-like viral mutations
now ebb their contaminating way across the land.  And where massive
expanses of mountains, plains, forests and deserts once hosted a myriad of
life forms, vast oceans have buried their homes.

	It was man himself who turned his living playground into a living
graveyard - with poisons, plastics, and nuclear waste.  He melted the polar
caps, flooding the continents.  And all that's left are thousands of
decaying land masses.  Masses known today as the Archipelagos.

	After most of the Earth's natural resources were covered by water,
man turned back to nuclear power.  He built obelisk reactors an all
inhabited archipelagos.  To distribute the power, he connected the obelisks
to node stations scattered across each island.

	It's hardly surprising that this nuclear system eventually began to
fail.  Rising radiation levels killed what little was left of warm-blooded
animal life.  The only surviving plants are eerie genetic mutations created
in an attempt to clean up the environment.

	Banshee Air Purifiers howl across many of the islands.  And the
disembodied souls of lost spirits, called Necromancers, dance their
bloodthirsty dance along the water's edge.

	You will enter this infernal nightmare alone.  And alone you'll
begin purifying the islands - one by one.

                    	GETTING STARTED

IBM PC and Compatibles

1. Insert the correct 'Archipelagos' boot disk into the drive and from the
MS-DOS prompt, select the correct drive specifier. 2. Type "ARCHI" and
press RETURN.  The game will now begin to load.

ATARI ST and Commodore Amiga

1. Turn off the computer and insert the 'Archipelagos' disk into the drive.
2. Switch the computer on.  The game will now begin to load.

Entering your Classified Counter-Code

You will be asked to type in a classified counter-code from your Hoverspere
Activation Codes.  You will be given the following information.

Codebook Page - 0
Alpha Code - X
Numeric Code - 00

First find the correct page.  Then look for the designated letter across
the top of the chart.  Now locate the prescribed number along the left side
of the chart.

	The box that falls where the designated alpha column and numeric
row coincide is your counter-code.  Type in this number and press the
RETURN KEY.

				5

Selecting an Archipelago

You can select any archipelago provided you have already completed the
archipelago preceding it.

	For example, if you have purified Archipelago #9, you can type in
Archipelago #10 and begin there.

	Once you've completed Archipelago #100, you are then free to select
any archipelago from 1 to 9,999.

		    PURIFYING AN ARCHIPELAGO

The concept behind purifying an archipelago is really quite simple:
deactivate the radioactive node/obelisk power system.

	In order to shut down an obelisk, you must first eliminate all the
nodes scattered about that archipelago.  Plus, there must be a direct land
connection between all nodes and the obelisk in order to completely drain
all radioactivity.  Which means that on certain archipelagos, you'll
actually have to create land bridges to let the radioactivity flow.

				6

	Once all your nodes are eliminated, a self-destruct timer will be
activated.  You'll have 90 seconds to return to the obelisks and shut it
down.  Or else the entire island will suffer from a major meltdown, taking
everything (including you) with it.

	Coming in contact with contaminated surfaces always means instant
death.  The oceans the surrounding coastlines have also absorbed high doses
of contamination.  So hover only above normal land surfaces.

                    HOVERSPHERE OPERATIONS

Your Hoversphere is a silicon-plasma ball.  It hovers about 10 meters above
the ground, to give you an all-encompassing 360 degree viewing and to
protect you from most poisonous ground pollutants.

	Hoversphere operations have been made intuitively easy - to let you
focus your energies on the task at hand.  A simple crosshair is used to
direct all hoversphere movements.

	The computer display system shows you what remains of the earth's
surface.  As you can see, it is now sectioned into a grid of squares.  This
makes it easier for you to target locations and move across the surface. 
You can move in two ways - depending on how fast and how far you wish to
travel.  The two wary are:

To Move By Squares - If the crosshair is not on the screen, press the right
mouse button.  Using your mouse, position the crosshair on an empty square.
 Then press the left button and you'll fly to that square.

				7

To Make Sweeping Pans - Press the right mouse button. (The Crosshair will
disappear).  Then move the mouse left or right.

To toggle between the above modes, press the right mouse button.

Keyboard users:  Use the RETURN KEY instead of the right mouse button, and
the SPACEBAR instead of the left mouse button.  Move the cursor using the
cursor keys.

IMPORTANT:  Because there have been different models of Plasmic
Hoverspheres, operational specs may vary.  Be sure to refer to the
operational guide specific to your system.

Operations for all systems

To pan left, move the crosshair to the left edge of screen.
To pan right, move the crosshair to the right edge of the screen.
To face the opposite direction, press F3
To discharge disinfectant or to create land, press F1
To view map, press F2
To leave map mode, press the right mouse button or the RETURN key.

System-specific Operations

For IBM PC and Compatibles

To change color palette, press F5
To terminate operations, press ESCAPE
Moving in keyboard mode, use the cursor (ARROW) keys.
To toggle between pan and action modes, press the RETURN key.
To move to the square the cursor is pointing to, press the SPACEBAR.

                     PURIFYING PROCEDURES

In observing the earth's surface, you'll immediately notice a pattern of
colored squares.  The colors themselves may vary depending on which type of
plasmic hoversphere your looking through.  But the effects - poisonous vs.
safe squares - will be the same.

As you can see from studying the chart above, most of the earth's surface
is unsafe.  (Which is precisely why you're here.)  Your hoversphere's
computer will not allow you to move to an infected, or sand square.  By
removing the obelisk you'll be able to render the entire surface of an
archipelago free from hazardous materials.  But in doing so, you may have
to disinfect certain areas - square by square - to be able to execute your
strategy.

To Disinfect an Infected Square - Place your crosshair on the infected
square and press F1.

				9

		        KNOW YOUR BOTANY

Identifying plant life on earth isn't very difficult.  But you should be
well aware of the dangers surrounding each type of flora.

Viral Trees

Originally created to help fight pollution, this hearty species now does
just the opposite.  Not only do these trees move towards you, but they also
infect the land around them with a deadly toxin.  If a square you're
standing on becomes infected, you will too.

Eco-Eggs

It's egg-like flower was designed to soak up toxic waste.  Unfortunately
Eco-Eggs are extremely fragile.  When one of these flowers breaks open, it
can quickly infect an entire island.

Sand Pods

The chemical resins in these low-growing, clustered plants are not too
dissimilar from the disinfectant your hoversphere uses.  Since there are no
fuel stations currently on Earth, you may wish to use these plants to
refuel.  (See Energy Maintenance, page 14.)

				10

		      CREATING LAND BRIDGES

In order to work your way around an archipelago, there will be times when
you need to create land where water or sand now exists.  You also need to
build land bridges to connect radioactive node points to the obelisk.  (See
Deactivating Nodes & Obelisks, below)

	Creating land is a two step process.  First you must turn water to
sand.  Then turn the sand to land.

	Here's is the procedure:

1. Locate the body of water which you want to change to land.
2. Place the crosshair on the square you wish to convert and press F1. 
Water will change to sand.
3. To change sand to land, press F1 again.

		    DEACTIVATING NODES & OBELISKS

In order to successfully purify an archipelago, you must deactivate its
obelisk.  But since all radioactive nodes are linked to the obelisk, the
nodes must be destroyed first.

	Also, in order for the obelisk to absorb the energy from a
deactivated node, there must be a direct land path from the node to the
obelisk.  So in certain cases, you'll have to create land bridges.  (See
Creating Land Bridges, above) from the node of the obelisk.

				11

To Deactivate a Node

1. If necessary, create a land bridge to the obelisk.  NOTE: the number of
nodes remaining to destroy will be indicated in the bottom right corner of
the screen.  A tone will sound if the node is not connected to the obelisk.

2. Move towards the node until it is in range of your crosshair.  (Avoid
getting any closer than three squares from the node.) 3. Place the
crosshair on the square that houses the node and press the left mouse
button.  The node will now collapse, and your hoversphere will absorb its
excess energy.

To Shut Down The Obelisk

1. Once all the nodes have been destroyed, a 90-seconds-to-melt-down timer
will be activated.  You must approach the obelisk as quickly as possible.

2. Place your crosshair on the obelisk's square then press the left mouse
button. (Keyboard users: use the spacebar.) 3. Congratulate yourself! 
You've just purified an archipelago.

				12

                      A WORD ON NECROMANCERS

By now you've probably heard plenty about Necromancers, those other EP's -
like yourself - who didn't make it.

	Necromancers are a very recent phenomena so we haven't had time to
do a thorough study on them.  But from the reports we've received there are
a few things we know for certain:

1. They're dangerous paranormal entities!  Direct contact with them is
almost certain death. 

2. They eat away at island edges.  Which means they can quickly destroy
land bridges you've worked so diligently to create.

                    BEWARE OF THE B-9000 (BANSHEE)

The Banshee is an Air Cleaner placed on earth only a few decades ago.  And
it's doing a very good job.

	But its creators didn't forsee our coming and - unfortunately -
didn't build a discrimination device into it.  Which means that the Banshee
attempts to clean up everything.  Including you! 

	The best way to handle them is simply to avoid them.  A strange
moaning sound should alert you to their presence.

				13

                          USING YOU MAPS

To help you figure out where you are - and where you need to go, your
hoversphere is equipped with a system that can generate a map of any
archipelago.

To access the map, press F2.

                        ENERGY MAINTENANCE

Throughout your mission on Earth, you'll continuously be using precious
energy.  Disinfecting or creating land drains energy rapidly.

	Fortunately, every time you destroy a node, you'll absorb its
excess energy.  But that won't always be enough.  So here's another method
of energy maintenance:

1. Locate a cluster of Sand Pods. (See Know your Botany, page 10).

2. Place the cursor on a square with Sand Pods and press the left mouse
button.

3. Absorb the Sand Pod's energy and your energy bar should increase.

				14

		          SURVIVAL TIPS

	Remember to point at the square, not the object.

	Sand Squares - whether infected or not - DO NOT LINK the nodes to
the obelisk.  But land squares, even infected ones, DO LINK the nodes to
the obelisk.

	When traveling across a vastly infected area (red), disinfect a
square to give yourself a safe place to move from.

	The terra-formed moon you see always hangs low in the norther sky. 
Use it to orient yourself.

	Deactivate the node closest to the obelisk last.  That way you
won't have to worry about having enough time to get to the obelisk when the
90-second self-destruct timer goes off.

	Necromancers can't cross water.  So when confronted with a
persistent Necromancer, create an island or peninsula to try and lure him
away from the shore.  He may then become permanently stranded out there.

	Fortunately, you can usually hear the screaming Banshees before you
can see them.  This gives you time to get out of their path.  You'll have
to act fast, because these are the fastest moving objects in all the
Archipelagos.

	When creating land bridges for the purpose of linking nodes to the
obelisk, remember that linked squares must share one side.  Diagonal
connections will not suffice.

	Lightning may cause Eco-Eggs to explode.

  The Lost Ark of the Covenant is a fairly simple adventure.  There are two
difficult parts in the game.  Those rely on good timing, making it difficult
for me to type up a step-by-step solution.  Not only that, but if I did type
up a step-by-step solution, your making the slightest mistake, such as a mis-
spelling, would throw off the timing.  Therefore I will just present the puz-
zles and how to overcome them...

TORCH: find this in the sundial room.  You will need it to venture into
       the caves, the pyramid, and the tunnels under the plate.  Be careful
       though, climbing down the vine with the torch lit is suicide.

PLANT: give this to the horse, it will make him 'somewhat docile'.

CAN: spray beehive with it.

HORSE: after getting the plant, feed horse, then ride horse.  He will get
       you safely across the river your first time, and he can ventue into
       the caves, but be careful.  He will be killed by the bear if you
       go cave, then go south.

GLASSES: these are used to read door (on the pyramid), read message (on top
         of the pyramid), and read the scroll (behind the cobwebs in the
         scroll library beneath the plate).  to take them off, move glasses,
         then drop glasses.  (after pickng them up, you have to 'wear' them).

WHIP: this will be used to whip the native.  If you attempt to shoot the
      native, his friends will hear the noise, and come and kill you.

NOTE: 'when the time is 99- go to my husband and he will give you a vine'.
      signed, Jan.  This refers of course to Tarzan's cameo appearance in
      the dense jungle, one move north of the pyramid.  You must go there
      on the 99th move, which is three moves after High Noon.  You cannot
      be wandering around that area waiting, either.  Look sundial to know
      how many moves you've made.  Moves are reset each day.

PISTOL: use this to shoot vulture, shoot canister (when in the worshipping
        chamber), shoot bear, shoot boa, and shoot rattlesnake.

GEMS: save all these.. when you get them, drop them near the ruins, unless
      it is too far out of your way.  You will have to have them to get
      the ark, near the end of the game

DIAMOND KNOB: pull knob.  it will give you a clue about how to get rid of
              the mako shark.  You must 'empty jug' to get rid of it.

CONTAINER: after getting rid of the shark, go boat, get container, u, u.
           move suit, drop suit, n, n, e, fill tank.

EGG: break egg, drop eggshells

STATUE: blow up by dropping canister, then shooting canister.. but first
        climb statue, u, n, pull knob, s, get head, break head, drop head,
        n, go gap, d, d.

PITCHFORK: you must have this to open the golden head.  It rips the
           thick seam.

CAVES: make a map!  True, going one direction, then going back does not
       work, but they are mappable.  write each square as a series of
       arrows, pointing to all possible exits.  in the room with the puddle
       on the floor, push ceiling, go crevasse.

SHOVEL: dig sand in the ruins room.

SUIT: get suit, wear suit before 'go ocean' from the first room in the
      game.

JUG: get clue by pulling diamond knob.  empty jug in the ocean where the
     shark is.

PRIMARY CHAMBER/ROD: get rod, it is used to unlock compartment in the
                     plane.

PARACHUTE: don't worry, you never actually use this.

MANUAL: you must read manual before attempting to fly the plane.  Both the
        manual and the parachute can be found in the compartment.

RUINS: dig sand, move plate, tie vine, to plate, drop torch, get torch,
       now get all the gems you can carry and 'go hole'.

SCROLL LIBRARY: move cobwebs, get scroll.  To read the scroll, you must
                be wearing the bi-lingo glasses, but don't worry, all it
                is is clue#2 that the gems should be placed in rainbow
                order.  The scroll will read 721-5634..

SARCOPHAGUS: now.. you should not be here unless you just woke up and it
             is late morning.  If you do not have the red, orange, yellow,
             green, blue, indigo, violet, and black gems then leave.
             for those who do, 'place (gemcolor)' in the order they appear
             above.  you must then wait until it is high noon, so the
             light can shine through a crack in the ceiling.

LEVER: pull this to reveal a secret passage into the holy tomb.  the passage
       however, is in the scroll library.. to go there, go west as far as
       you can, then s, s, go passage, w.

RIVER: the horse gets you across the first time.  Your clue on how to get
       back is on top of the pyramid.  You must shoot the vulture, then drop
       it when you are at the east riverbank.  now w, d, get orange, up, w.

BEAM: whip beam.. takes you into next room of pyramid.

BEAM OF LIGHT: whip beam again.  this causes the pitchfork to leap out at
               your whip.  now drop whip, if you've read the whip info, you
               won't need it anymore... get pitchfork.

IN PALM TREE: get coconut.  you cannot break this, it's too hard.  You must
              throw coconut, from the top of the cliff, then go n, n, w, s,
              get black.

VULTURE AREA: shoot vulture, get vulture, get egg, break egg, drop eggshells.
              you now have the yellow stone.

CAVE ROOM#1: once you are rid of the horse, go south, shoot bear, get red.

RATTLESNAKE: shoot rattlesnake, get scimitar, look scimitar, look pommel,
             break scimitar, drop scimitar.  You now have the indigo.

IN CLEARING (TREE W/BOA): shoot boa, get violet.

        First thing you gotta do is make a party....simple enough....I
     recommend a paladin, warrior, bard, rogue, conjurer, and magician
     to start with....
        I didn't use a bard in my party but I created one and edited him 
     to about level 56 when I needed to get farther in Harkyn's castle. A 
     hunter many be more preferable because they're devastating at higher
     levels, but you need a bard, or the teleport spell, to solve the game
     so you can do like I did or just make a bard to start, they're really 
     not that bad.....

        Okay, next you want to vist Garth's equipment shop, which is marked 
     by a "G" on the Skara Brae map, and buy what you need...you can also 
    sell items that you find and whatever he didn't have he'll keep an 
    inventory of.

        For now, just wander around the town and get some encounters by 
    going into all the empty building in the street...avoid fighting the
    guardian statues, except maybe the samuri one on Rakhir street, and do
    this until all your characters reach 2nd level or maybe even 3rd. When 
    you reach 2nd or whatever the case may be, you might wanna try you luck
    against the guardian giant statues, which can be found around the temple
    or Fargoer street and right above Harkn's castle off Blue Highway.
        Or if you'd rather you can go ahead and kill the samuri on Rakhir 
    street, go into the bar behind it and have one of your player order a
    wine...the bartender will then tell you to go into the wine celler and
    pick a bottle, so you do that.
        You can wander in here for awhile, though there isn't much to see,
    or go down the stairs at (18 north, 7 east) and enter the sewers. 
        The sewershave a lot more monsters so you'll have your hands full 
    here, but the only thing you really need to get in here is the name of 
    the Mad God, which the magic mouth at (4 north, 3 east, 2 below) tells
    you...that's the 2nd level of the sewers...
        On the 3rd level of the sewers (16 north, 17 east, 3 below) is a set
    of stairs that will take you Mangar's tower after you have gotten the 
    Onyx key, so if you find these before you have the key, don't worry about
    it right now.  
        After you have gotten the name of the Mad God, which is "Tarjan", you
    should be ready to enter the catacombs. Go to any of the Mad God's temples
    in Grand Plaz and speak to the priest...answer Tarjan and in you go.
        The first level is likewise uninteresting, though a much more complex
    dugeon, except for an encounter with a serant of the Mad God named Bashar
    Kavilor, a master sorceror. You can get to him by going through the one 
    way door in the big "circle" of doors outside the spiral, but you better
    have the phase door spell or apport arcane (teleport) or you won't be able 
    to get back out unless you kill yourselves. Remember, you don't have to 
    fight him if you don't want to and can just go to the 3rd level.
        In the 3rd level you have to kill the "Ancient with King" and retrieve
    the eye of the Mad God. To get to him go to the teleporter at (0,21) and 
    then you'll appear at (10,7). From here go to the second teleporter at 
    (21,15) and you'll appear at (13,17). Just follow the winding corridor and
    go through the 2 doors until you meet face to face...the "Witch King" is
    actually a spectre and very tough at that, even worse his touch drains a
    level. You probably won't be able to hit him with weapons so you'll have
    to use spells. (stone tough might do the trick, if you have it, but if not 
    just try your damage spells.)
        Don't worry if someone get drained...the temple will restore lost 
    levels, for a price of course.
        If you do kill him and have enough room for more objects then one of
    the party will get the eye and you can take the next step in the 
    adventure...the eye is also worth a good bit so you might want to look at
    the duplicating cheat in the cheat section in the program.
        The next place to go is, if your ready, Harken's castle. You can tell 
    if your ready for Hawkyn's castle. The grey gragon statue will always be a 
    problem if it breathes on your party so don't worry if you lose a few 
    members to it before you get in the castle, just go to the temple right 
    outside and get fixed up.
        The only thing to get on the first level is the crystal sword at 
    (0,19). Tough to get to the stairs to the second level you will need a 
    bard. If you already have one you can go to the throne in the big room and
    have the bard sit on it...the only other obstacle will be the captain of
    the guardat the end of the next corridor, he is a master ninja but will 
    not critically hit if he can't hit you; hence a high armor class.
       The second level of the castle has quit a bit more, most importantly 
    the silver square, which you get to by tracing your way to telporter 3.
    you will have to go through smoke, which can be dispelled by casting or
    recasting a light spell, and answering a riddle, whose answer is 
    "Vampire". You can also get a ybarrashield if you answer the magic mouth 
    at (0,19) with "Shields" and you can fight some extremely tough madar 
    guards at (14,4). I would suggest not fighting these things because like I
    said, they're very tough and would give even a party of 15th levels 
    characters a hard time.
       There are a lot of creatures, darkness spots, damage spots, etc. also
    on this level but nothing else of significance so you now go to the third 
    level.
       The third level has what you got the eye in the catacombs for and it 
    can be found at (1,20,2 above) if you can teleport there. It is a statue 
    of the Mad God which comes to life if you approach it and and one of the 
    party members has the eye. You then have to fight him but he is really not
    as tough as you might think...just cast death strike, stone touch, or
    somthing as potent at him.
       Immediately after you kill him, you will be telported outside to the 
    upper-right corner of the town, just outside Kylarean's tower. The only 
    other thing of intertest on this level is the room with Harkn's legion, 
    which is 4 sets of 99 beserkers. If you your first 3 characters have an
    ac of -8 or better than you have nothing to worry about as long as you can
    cast mind blade spell, which affects all of the creature and will kill at 
    least half of them the first time. If you do kill them all, youre looking
    at 65,000 experience points for each member of the party...imagine what 
    that could do if you kept coming back here...though I wouldn't go through 
    the trouble without the apport arcane spell.
       Oh, by the way, you have to go through the legion before you get to the
    Mad God, unless you teleport.
       Kylarean's tower was by far the hardest dungeon, not toughest, becuase 
    it is filled with darkness and is a bitch to map. Anyways the first thing 
    you have to do is take the teleporter T1 to (21,21) and then follow the
    small corridor to T2 which takes you to (12,11). From there go to the 
    magic mouth at T3 and answer "Stone Golem" and you'll be "ported" to 
    (8,9), all these coordinates are marked by number appropriate to the 
    teleporter by the way...From here you have to go to the magic mouth at 
    (2,12), marked by an 'R' on the map, and answer "Sinister Street". That
    will make the door at (5,1) appear so you'll have to make your way to the
    maze, but before you go to the door you have to go get the silver circle,
    which is at (20,2). After you get it, you can weave your way to and 
    through that door. Just keep going south through the rooms until you reach
    the crystal golem, just pause a moment here to kill it, supposedly the 
    crystal sword is supposed to help but isn't necessary, and continue. Enter
    the follow the long "serpent-way", go to the appropriate rooms, or 
    whatever it takes to get to teleporter 5. From here just follow the 
    corridor and at the end you will have to enter a small room, wherein sits
    Kylarean. He will give you the onyx keyand then you will have to go 
    forward once more into the last teleporter, which takes you straight to 
    the stairs. Then you say bye, bye.
       Uh oh, this is it!, you are now ready to face the final challenge! or 
    are you?
       First of all, to get to Mangar's tower you have to go to the stairs on 
    the 3rd level of the sewers with the onyx key. Then if you are feeling 
    bold you answer "yes" to whether you what to use the stairsor not.
       The first level has nothing special but you'll have to study the map to 
    see the pattern in which you get to the parts of the dungeon, unless you
    teleport anywhere on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd levels of this dungeon, but not
    not anywhere else.
       On the second level you get the final silver "Shape" by answering 
    "Circle" to the magic mouth at the center of the "squares" at (15,4). This
    is all you need to do here so you can make your way to the stairs up and
    proceed to the third level. 
       The third level was a bit tricky to get through, but at leastyou have
    help. There is a series of inscriptions, 7 to be exact, that were to be
    found so you could answer the magic mouth at (4,10). But since I've found 
    them for you, you can go straight to the mouth. Answer "lie", "with",
    "passion", "and", "be", "forever", "damned" in that order with <cr> after
    each one and "lost" starirs will appear at (9,3). Before you go though,
    you have to get the master key from keymaster for 50,000 gold pieces. Now,
    you can go to up the "lost" stairs.
       On the fourth level just go to each teleporter in turn until you come 
    to the point marked "X" on the map. Moving into this spot will cause doors
    appear everywhere where there were none and the doorsthat were already 
    there to disappear...that makes a lot of doors but if you look at the map 
    you see that you can now get to the portal up....so what are you waiting 
    for?
       Well, this is really it!, The fifth and final level. Go to the 
    teleporters as you need to and make your way to the pool of boiling 
    liquid, marked by a 'P' on the map. Then what?, jump in of course! Go 
    north from where you appear and go to the end of corridor just before the 
    one-way door. Now you see what you needed the silver shapes for now Huh?
    Anyways you can keep going north until you reach Mangar or you can go 
    through that first door and follow the wall to the right until you reach 
    the magic mouth at (21,10), which happens to be right above Mangar's room.
    Answer "spectre snare" to the magic mouth and you'll get it...you can use
    that against Mangar if you want, but a "simple" deathstrike will do it. 
    When you kill him Kylarean appears and give each party member 300,000 
    experience points and gold pieces, but doesn't teleport you out and as far 
    as I know you can't get out unless you kill yourself. Demeaning I know but
    at least you get to keep 300,000 gold and experience

                          (Tales Of The Unknown)

              (Full Solution - compiled by John R. Barnsley)

CASTLE  -  Top RH - need eye from Catacombs.........KYLEARON'S TOWER - Kill

enter MANGAR'S TOWER through the long staircase in the Sewer).

                               THE SOLUTION

Obviously,  the  first thing you must do is assemble your party. There is a
BEGINNING  party  (supplied  with  the  game) already equipped with a basic
level  of  Armour,  Instruments, etc. A much better and unique option is to
transfer  characters  over  from  either  WIZARDRY  or  ULTIMA  III!! These
characters  come  over  as  fairly  senior  level  characters  and make the
beginning   of   this   game  much  easier.  This  is  a  highly  desirable
alternative.

If  you  create your own characters - which you MUST do for your Bard - pay
special attention to the DEXTERITY attribute. This attribute determines who
strikes  first  in  combat,  and  can  be  the  difference  between an easy
encounter and one which is a struggle.

Magic users should have a HIGH IQ, while Fighter classes should have a HIGH
STRENGTH. It is recommended that you choose a Monk as one of your Fighters.
Their  Armour  class  drops  as their level rises. Eventually the Monk will
have an Armour class of 'LO' wearing only a robe. They can also do the most
damage unarmed in actual combat!

The  starting  party  in  this  solution consisted of a Monk, 2 Paladins, a
Bard,  a  Magician  and  a Conjuror. At higher levels of the game, you will
want to trade in one of your Paladins and develop another MAGIC user.

When  you  first  leave  the  Adventurer's  Guild,  explore the City. Visit
Garth's  Armoury,  and  find  the  Review Board (located next to the Inn on
Trumpet  Street). Don't wander too far until you get a feel for how you can
survive.  To  restore HIT POINTS after fighting, visit a Temple. There, all
ills  - including death - can be cured for a price. After a fight, you will
quite  frequently  find  objects  of some type. Keep them all. If you don't
need them, go to Garth's and sell them for gold - you will need it!

Visit  Roscoe's  Energy Emporium located off the Gran Plaz on the corner of
Grey  Knife  Street. There you will get an idea of what it costs to RESTORE
SPELL POINTS.

Early  on,  when you are still short of gold, the best way to restore Spell
Points  is to go into the Adventurer's Guild and just wait. This game is in
real-time  and Spell Points are restored as you just sit there. If you wait
on the street or in a house, you will almost certainly be attacked.

When  you  find  an  object  after  a  fight or in a Chest in the Dungeons,
experiment with it to find out what it is. There are no cursed items. Quite
a  few  objects have magical properties that are not readily apparent. Here
are  a  few  of the objects that you will find most useful, even though you
won't run into these until later in the game:

(1) KAEL'S AXE: Seems to be the best weapon, causing the most damage
                for your Paladins.

(2) FROST HORN: For your Bard, when used in combat it causes 40 - 70
                Hit Points of damage to a group of Monsters.

(3) MAGE STAFF: For your Magic Users, allows them to regain Spell
                Points even in a Dungeon (this is incredibly useful).

It is left to the individual player to discover the usefulness of the other
items  found  during  the  game.  After learning the game-play by wandering
around  the  City  and  being  able  to  survive,  it  is time to visit the
Dungeons. This is where the battle with Mangar will be won or lost!

There  are FIVE Dungeons in the game that must be explored in the following
order:

                         (A) WINE CELLAR & SEWERS
                             (B) THE CATACOMBS
                            (C) HARKYN'S CASTLE
                           (D) KYLEARAN'S TOWER
                            (E) MANGAR'S TOWER

Each  contains  something  that  will  help in the subsequent stages of the
game.

WINE CELLAR & SEWERS.
The  easiest  dungeon of them all is reached from the Inn on Rakhir Street.
Enter  the  Inn,  ask  to order a drink, then select WINE. You will then be
ushered into the Wine Cellar. I cannot overstress the importance of MAPPING
in  this  game.  Whenever  possible, have the MALE SPELL in operation. This
will  help you avoid some of the traps that are lying around. When you have
an encounter and find a Chest, always cast a TRZP SPELL to disarm any traps
that may be guarding the Chest.

Located  in  the  Wine  Cellar are the stairs down to the SEWERS. The First
Level  of  the  Sewers  contains  almost nothing of interest. So locate the
stairs  to  the  Second  Level of the Sewers as quickly as possible and get
down there. The Second Level contains one very important bit of information
that  you  will need to enter The Catacombs: the name of the Mad God. There
are  also  two  hints  to  questions  that will be asked in other Dungeons.
Explore  this level fully to find all the hints and the Mad God's name. The
Lowest  Level of the Sewers is next and contains one item of importance for
later in the game. Locate and take the stairs exiting from this level. Make
sure  you  know  where the stairs lead EXACTLY. After this (I hope you have
been  visiting  the  Review Board regularly to advance levels and learn new
spells), you are ready for the Catacombs.

THE CATACOMBS.
The Catacombs are reached from one of the Mad God's Temples, located on the
East  side of the Temple. Ask to speak to the Priest, then give him the Mad
God's name: TARJAN.

The  First  Level  of  the catacombs is just a survival test at this stage.
Once  you  can survive there fairly easily, head for the Second Level. This
level  has  a  clue  in it about the Mad God. It also contains a very nasty
creature  called  a  Soul  Sucker that lurks in the Southwest corner of the
Second  Level. If you decide to go in there and try him out, make sure that
you  have your character disk backed up. You will not be able to defeat him
at this stage of your development but, fortunately, you don't have to!

The  lowest  Level  contains  something  you will need later. Once you have
reached  the  Third  Level  you  must  use  a  TELEPORT SQUARE to enter the
Wizard's  Realm.  The  Teleport  is  located in the SOUTHEAST CORNER of the
Dungeon.  Once  you  are in the Wizard's Realm, you must defeat him to gain
the  EYE.  After  you  have  this  item,  you  are ready to tackle Harkyn's
Castle.

HARKYN'S CASTLE.
Harkyn's  Castle  is located in the NORTHEAST CORNER of SKARA BRAE. At this
point  in  the  game, it becomes very important for you to have filled your
special  slot with the most powerful character your magic users can summon.
If you are in the process of developing a Wizard, a lesser demon is best.

The First Level of this castle contains one item of importance: THE CRYSTAL
SWORD  from  the SOUTHEAST corner of this level. You will now begin to find
some   of  the  more  powerful  objects  to  experiment  with  during  your
encounters. After obtaining the CRYSTAL SWORD, head for the Second Level of
the  Castle.  The  stairs  are located in the NORTHEAST corner of the First
Level.

The  Second  Level of the Castle has a couple of interesting things. If you
answer  the riddle correctly ("SHIELDS") you get a MAGIC MOUTH which can be
used  to  cast  the SOSI SPELL. You must also obtain the SILVER SQUARE from
the  SOUTHWEST corner of the Dungeon. The access to this is from a TELEPORT
located  towards  the  middle  of  the Northern section of the Dungeon. The
PORTAL  to  the  Third  Level  is  located in the NORTHEAST section of this
level.

The Third Level of the Castle contains the ENTRANCE to KYLEARAN'S TOWER and
some  interesting  opportunities.  The  answer to the Old Man's question is
"SKULL  TAVERN".  When  you  encounter the Berserkers, located at 12E 5N of
this  level,  take  advantage.  They can be fairly easily defeated with the
right magic spells. You should have at least 2 Sorcerers capable of casting
the  MIBL SPELL. It also helps if your Bard has a FROST or FIRE HORN to aid
the others along.

When  you  can  defeat  these guys easily, it is time to make another Magic
User.  You  can  TELEPORT  from  the CASTLE ENTRANCE, fight the Berserkers,
TELEPORT  back  back to the Entrance, exit the Castle, then do it again and
again  until  your  spells run low. At 60,000 Experience Points a crack, it
doesn't take long to develop a decent Magic User.

After this, it is time to attempt Kylearan's Castle. When you approach, and
fight  the  STATUE  OF  THE MAD GOD located in the SOUTHEAST corner of this
level, you will be teleported inside the gates of Kylearan's Tower.

KYLEARAN'S TOWER.
After  the  battle  with  the Mad God and your subsequent teleport (you DID
have  the  EYE in your possession?!), go ONE STEP forward, TURN RIGHT, then
kick the door down. You will then be entering one of the two most difficult
mazes  in  the  game.  Most of it is in the dark and there are riddles that
must be answered. Back up your character disk BEFORE entering this maze!

Once you are in, watch carefully for teleports - they are everywhere. It is
extremely  important  that you map this maze VERY CAREFULLY. After you have
reached  the ANTIMAGIC SQUARE from wandering in a very small section of the
dark, the next step forward is a TELEPORT to 11E 12N.

Explore  until  you  find  a  MAGIC MOUTH that asks you to "Name the one of
cold,  foretold twofold". The answer to this one is "STONE GOLEM". You will
then  be  teleported  again.  After this, you will enter a very large, dark
area.  In  order  to get out of this, you must answer the question posed at
12E  2N  which  says:  "Name  the  Endless  Byway  and  your  path  will be
guaranteed".  The  answer  to this is the only street in Skara Brae with no
end - "SINISTER".

You  can  then map your way through a lighted section to another dark area.
From  this  dark  area  you must obtain the SILVER TRIANGLE, located at the
very  NORTH  of the dark area. You can then exit the dark area, going SOUTH
from  1E 6N. After this, you will face the CRYSTAL GOLEM (did you bring the
CRYSTAL  SWORD?).  You can defeat him with conventional weapons and spells,
but  somebody  has  to  have the Crystal Sword or he will reappear to block
your exit!

At  this  point, you can exit the Tower to refresh your players or continue
on.  If you exit, when you re-enter you must again answer the endless byway
question  to continue. Upon reaching the end of the Snakey Road on the East
side  of the maze, DON'T go through the South door. Take the door that goes
WEST.  You  will  then enter several rooms with Spinners and Teleports that
make finding your way almost impossible!

The  way  past these is SOUTHWEST. When you make it, you will be teleported
to 14E 1N. It is then an easy stroll to meet Kylearan himself. He turns out
to  be  the friendly Wizard and gives you a KEY that allows you to get into
MANGAR'S  TOWER. He then teleports you to the stairs exiting his tower. You
no  longer  need  the  Crystal  Sword or the Eye, and you are now ready for
Mangar himself!!

MANGAR'S TOWER.
If  you  paid  heed  and  followed  the stairs from the Bottom Level of the
Sewers,  you  will know how to get inside Mangar's walls. If not, go to the
Wine  Cellar,  TELEPORT your party 17E 16N 3D, and take the stairs UP. Then
TURN  RIGHT and kick the door in. You should be at the Entrance to Mangar's
Tower.

Level  One  is fairly easy to find your way around in. Follow the teleports
and  walk  around  until  you reach the MAGIC MOUTH on the EAST side of the
maze.  What is tricky is that after leaving the MAGIC MOUTH, you are now on
Level Two of the Tower.......so BE CAREFUL with your mapping!

Level  Two is again fairly easy (not even a warm-up for Level Three!). From
this  level  you  must  answer the question located at 4E 15N to obtain the
SILVER  CIRCLE.  The answer to the question is "CIRCLE". You must then make
your  way  to  the stairs located in the MIDDLE of the SOUTHERN side of the
maze.

Level  Three  is  the  hardest  maze  of  all, but by this time you must be
getting really proficient at mapping. You must wander around this level and
obtain  quite  a  number  of items. First of all, you should get the MASTER
KEY,  for  50,000  Gold  Pieces, from 19E 12N. This Key allows you to enter
Mangar's through the Front Gate, instead of from the Sewers.

You must then find the CLUES to the SEVEN WORDS needed to access the Fourth
Level of Mangar's. Gratefully, you can teleport into and out of this level.
After  finding  the  CLUES, you can then SPEAK the SEVEN WORDS to the MAGIC
MOUTH located at 10E 4N. They MUST be entered ONE AT A TIME. The words are:
"LIE WITH PASSION AND BE FOREVER DAMNED". Stairs will then appear at 3E 9N.
This is the ONLY way to obtain access to the UPPER REACHES of MANGAR'S!!

The  Fourth  Level  of  Mangar's  has  only ONE tricky part. When you first
arrive,  you  have  a  LIMITED  NUMBER of ways you can go. After reaching a
certain  point,  located in the NORTHEAST CORNER of the level, doors appear
everywhere.  Don't  be  confused!  Everything maps the same, it's just that
doors  are  everywhere!! Eventually, you will find the PORTAL to Level Five
in the SOUTHWEST corner of this level.

Level Five is the home stretch. This easy maze leads you to the LAVA PIT in
the  middle  of  the  EASTERN  side  of the maze. There you DIVE IN and are
TELEPORTED  to  10E 6N. You will then find the march up the Hall of Harm to
be  fruitless if you didn't bring the THREE SILVER ITEMS along. If you have
the  SILVER  TRIANGLE,  SILVER SQUARE and SILVER CIRCLE, a door will appear
directly NORTH of you.

After  passing through this door, cast your REST SPELL to restore everybody
to HEALTH and proceed directly NORTH to the final battle with Mangar!

The  final  battle itself is a large disappointment as it is fairly easy to
defeat  Mangar  and  his  Vampires,  and meet Kylearan again, who gives you
300,000  bonus  Experience  Points.  After  defeating  Mangar, you can then
proceed ONE MORE SQUARE NORTH for the LAST QUESTION of the game!

The  answer  is:  "SPECTRE  SNARE",  which you then receive (it is good for
binding to your party any of your opponents in battle).

                              How To Win BRE
                                   by
                                Joe Vidunas
                              -=North Jabip=-

Day one:
   Set industries to all 0%
   Set tax rate at 37%
   Trade agreement with everybody
   sell 29500 food sell all soldiers sell all commanders
   buy 2 agriculture
   then buy as many Deserts as you can for the remainder of turns.

Day Two:
   Buy as many Deserts as you can  hopefully you'll get bout 500 by now.

Day Three:
   If you don't have 500 Deserts continue buying them till you do then
   buy enough military to defeat pirates 1000 sol, 1000 jets, 1000 tanks..
   invest remaining money for 24 hours at the end of turns.

Day Four- Day 29 approximately.     [Investment Phase]
   Do not buy anything with the following exceptions...
       1) agriculture if you need em...  perhaps 10 or 20 total.
       2) military to maintain success against pirates.

   Turn flow...

   Start turns 5 minutes after investments from previous day return... you
   must have all money with you.

   Each turn...
     Pay everything.
     Feed everyone.
     attack pirates put regions gained in rivers
     say yes to put remaining coins in the bank  (earns 2% interest per turn)
     do not attack anyone and if your attacked write down who did it for
      later reprisals.

   When turns are finished and your at the first menu..  go to ip ops,
   bank and invest all money in four equal parts for 24 hours.

 Day 29 approximate to Day 39.      [Spread out money]
     At this point you should have about 1.5 billion coins in investments..

      Take turns as before with the following exception you must withdraw from
      bank anything over 1.5 billion and say no to put remaining coins in bank
      cause you wont get 2% each turn if you have more then 1.5 billion in
      the bank.

     When turns are finished you should have about 1.8 billion in coins
     invest 400 million for 240 hours (returns 1.1 billion in 10 days).
     and invest the rest (1.4 billion) for 24 hours returns (1.54 billion).

     Repeating this over a ten day period will allow you to have 10 consecutive
     1 billion plus returns...  nice EH?

 Day 39 or whenever you are the day before your first 10 day investment Returns.

     Now the fun begins....
     You should have 1.54 billion on hand and 10 days of 1 billion + returns.
     You may freely spend approximately 500 million per day and still have
     500 million left to invest for 10 days to maintain your 10 returns.

     Sounds fun but how do I spend it...
      Buy jets and attack those who attacked you...

Military tips:
     Buy only jets and missile bases for the following reasons...
     1) point breakdown of military pieces...
                Soldiers -  1 offensive 1 defensive    useless and eat too much
                Tanks    -  2 offensive 2 defensive    too expensive and can't
                                                       be offensive and defensive
                                                       at the same time.
                Jets     -  2 offensive 0 defensive    ATTACK with these never
                                                       keep them around.
            Miss. Bases  -  0 offensive 2 defensive    Buy these to protect your
                                                       Regions.
             Agents      -  n/a                        Buy lots of these 1 million
                                                       never hurt.
                                                       If you are running low on
                                                       them trade them all to
                                                       friend on board
                                                       for outrageous amount.
                                                       price drops buy ton of em
                                                       and when friend refuses
                                                       agreement you get the
                                                       others back too.

     So turns from day 39 on should go like this.

first menu: Send out returning jets take loan if necessary to get rid of
            em so you wont have to maintain them.

   Any regions won spread evenly into mountain, desert, river.

   Turn 1 trade away agents if necessary and don't attack pirates if agents
          traded so you have zero for turn 2.  make sure no more than 1.5 billion
          in the bank.
   Turn 2 buy agents if necessary.
turn 3-end  roll over money no more then 1.5 billion in bank.
Last turn   buy missile bases to protect newly gained regions..  1 million bases
            per 1000 regions works best
            buy jets and carriers to attack with. As many as you can and still
            have 500 million to invest for 10 days.

first menu: Send out newly purchased jets.
            Invest remaining money divided for safety for 10 days.


Problems to watch for...
  Your worst enemy in this scenario is you cause no one can attack your money
  in investments... so you can't lose unless you do one of the following.

  1) Go crazy and spend everything...  all will be lost and you'll have to
     start over.

  2) Crumble the empire do to playing without your money on hand and not
     Having enough to pay for missile bases on hand or jets you did not
     send back out.

  3) Getting nasty with people and inviting nukes and GK's and coverts all
     of which are bad but not devestating unless everyone is doing it to
     you at the same time.

Attacking tips...
  How many jets to send...  you need to send approximately 1 jet for every
    net worth point the enemy has this will gaurantee success 90% of the time.

  Attack whole BBS's if possible you'll get more regions...  and do so in
    group attacks so no one knows you (alone usually) did it.

  Confine attacks to 2-4 different BBS's so you don't get too many enemies
    at once...

  Test the water prior to attack with a message or covert to make sure target
    is recieving incoming packets so you don't lose 15 million jets into space.

This method is guaranteed to beat anyone using any other tactic than this one
   and not cheating...

You cannot really defeat someone else using this tactic so make friends with
   them or you'll both end up losing...

You also cannot defeat someone else who is cheating so ignore them...

Have a good game and may none of your investments crash...

 THE BARD'S TALE
     Part 1

 THE BARD'S TALE is a multi-character role-playing game in the tradition of the
WIZARDRY series. It was written by Michael Cranford of Interplay Productions and
distributed by Electronic Arts.

 The game begins in the town of Skara Brae, where the evil wizard Mangar the
Dark has isolated the town from all help by casting a spell of eternal winter on
the surrounding countryside. Mangar has defeated all the good wizards and
warriors of note in the town and has infested the town with his evil minions.
The task now before you as junior magic casters and warriors is to defeat Mangar
and restore Skara Brae to its rightful inhabitants. Oh yes, you should bring a
bard along to record your deeds. He will sing your praises if you succeed, or
croon a dirge at your funerals.

 The magic system used in the game is rich in diversity. A magic user must start
out as either a magician, specializing in casting magical effects on non-magical
objects, or a conjurer, who deals with the instantaneous creation of objects and
effects through magic. After learning at least 3 spell levels in a magic art, a
magic user can change from one class to another. But do not be too hasty: after
leaving one class you can never go back to it.

 Once a magic user becomes proficient in at least one art, he can then become a
sorcerer. Sorcery deals with the magic of illusion and magical perception. If a
magic user becomes proficient in at least two of the arts, he can then become a
wizard. Wizardry deals with the summoning and control of supernatural creatures.
The experience points required to advance a level as a wizard are much higher
than the other magic classes. It is best to let your magic user advance all the
way to level 7 in whichever art he is in before changing classes. But be sure to
change class after he has attained level 7 of the art. In the dungeons there are
many traps for the unwary; you never know who will be killed and what spells are
required to save your party from extinction.

 There are several different fighter classes available in the game: monks,
paladins, hunters, warriors and rogues. All have different strengths and
weaknesses. During combat only the first three members of your party can
physically fight or be attacked; the last three can cast spells. It pays early
in the game to have three fighters of some type to protect your magic users from
physical combat and free them to concentrate on a magical attack.

 The bard is a unique individual who can fight, albeit poorly, and cast six
magical spells by playing an instrument. You must have one along, as this is the
Bard's Tale. to the final battle with Mangar.

 The final batle itself is a large disappointment as it is fairly easy to
defeat Mangar and his vampires, and meet Kylearan again, who gives you 300,000
bonus experience points. After defeating Mangar, you can then proceed one more
square north for the last question of the game. The answer is "SPECTRE SNARE,"
which you then receive (it is good for binding to your party any of your
opponents in battle).


 THE BARD'S TALE
      Part 2

 Obviously, the first thing you must do is assemble your party. There is a
beginning party (supplied with the game) already equipped with a basic level of
armor, instruments, etc. A much better and unique option is to transfer
characters over from either WIZARDRY or ULTIMA III. These characters come over
as fairly senior level characters and make the beginning of this game much
easier. This is a highly desirable alternative.

 If you create your own characters -- which you must do for your bard -- pay
special attention to the dexterity attribute. This attribute determines who
strikes first in combat, and can be the difference between an easy encounter and
one which is a struggle. Magic users should have a high IQ, while fighter
classes should have a high strength. I recommend a monk as one of your fighters.
Their armor class drops as their level rises. Mine eventually had an armor class
of LO wearing only a robe. They also can do the most damage unarmed in actual
combat.

 My starting party consisted of a monk, two paladins, a bard, a magician and a
conjurer. At higher levels of the game, you will want to trade in one of your
paladins and develop another magic user.

 When you first leave the Adventurer's Guild, explore the city. Visit Garth's
Armory, and find the Review Board (located next to the inn on Trumpet Street).
Don't wander too far until you get a feel for how you can survive. To restore
hit points after fighting, visit a temple. There all ills -- including death --
can be cured for a price. After a fight, you will quite frequently find objects
of some type. Keep them all. If you don't need them, go to Garth's and sell them
for gold -- you will need it.

 Visit Roscoe's Energy emporium located off the Gran Plaz on the corner of Grey
Knife Street. There you will get an idea what it costs to restore spell points.

 Early on, when you are still short of gold, the best way to restore spell
points is to go into the Adventurer's Guild and just wait. This game is in real
time, and spell points are restored as you just sit there. If you wait on the
street or in a house, you will almost certainly be attacked.

 When you find an object after a fight or in a chest in the dungeons, experiment
with it to find out what it is. There are no cursed items. Quite a few objects
have magical properties that are not readily apparent. Here are a few of the
objects that I found most useful, even though you won't run into these until
later in the game: Kael's Axe seemed to be the best weapon, causing the most
damage for my Paladins; a frost horn for your Bard, when used in combat, causes
40-70 hit points of damage to a group of monsters; a mage staff for your magic
users allows them to regain spell points even in a dungeon (this is incredibly
useful). I will leave it up to you to discover the usefulness of the other items
found during the game.

 After learning the game play by wandering around the city and being able to
survive, it is time to visit the dungeons. This is where the battle with Mangar
will be won or lost.


 THE BARD'S TALE
      Part 3

 There are five dungeons in the game that must be explored in the following
order: Wine Cellar and Sewers, The Catacombs, Harkyn's Castle, Kylearan's Tower,
and Mangar's Tower. Each contains something that will help in the subsequent
stages of the game.

 Wine Cellar and Sewers

 The easiest dungeon of them all is reached from the inn on Rakhir Street. Enter
the inn, ask to order a drink, then select wine. You will then be ushered into
the Wine Cellar. I cannot overstress the importance of mapping in this game.
Whenever possible, have the MALE spell in operation. This will help you avoid
some of the traps that are lying around. When you have an encounter and find a
chest, always cast a TRZP spell to disarm any traps that may be guarding the
chest.

 Located in the Wine Cellar are the stairs down to the Sewers. The first level
of the Sewers contains almost nothing of interest. So locate the stairs to the
second level of the sewers as quickly as possible and get down there. The second
level contains one very important bit of information that you will need to enter
the Catacombs: the name of the Mad God. There are also two hints to questions
that will be asked in other dungeons. Explore this level fully to find all the
hints and the Mad God's name. The lowest level of the Sewers is next and
contains one item of importance for later in the game. Locate and take the
stairs exiting from this level. Make sure you know where the stairs lead
exactly. After this (I hope you have been visiting the Review Board regularly to
advance levels and learn new spells), you are ready for the Catacombs.

 The Catacombs

 The Catacombs are reached from one of the Mad God's Temples, located on the
east side of the Gran Plaz. After entering the Temple, ask to speak to the
priest, then give him the Mad God's name: TARJAN.
 The first level of the Catacombs is just a survival test at this stage. Once
you can survive there fairly easily, head for the second level of the Catacombs.
The second level has a clue in it about the Mad God. It also contains a very
nasty creature called a Soul Sucker that lurks in the southwest corner of the
second level. If you decide to go in there and try him out, make sure you have
your character disk backed up. You will not be able to defeat him at this stage
of your development, but fortunately you don't have to.
 The lowest level of the Catacombs contains something you will need later. Once
you have reached the third level of the Catacombs, you must use a teleport
square to enter the Wizard's Realm. The teleport is located in the southeast
corner of the dungeon. Once you are in the Wizard's Realm, you must defeat him
to gain the Eye. After you have this item, you are ready to tackle Harkyn's
Castle.


 THE BARD'S TALE
     Part 4

 Harkyn's Castle

 Harkyn's Castle is located in the northeast corner of Skara Brae. At this point
in time, it becomes very important for you to have filled your special slot with
the most powerful character your magic users can summon. If you are in the
process of developing a wizard, a lesser demon is best.

 The first level of Harkyn's Castle contains one item of importance: the Crystal
Sword from the southeast corner of this level. You will now begin to find some
of the more powerful objects to experiment with during your encounters. After
obtaining the crystal sword, head for the second level of the Castle. The stairs
are located in the northeast corner of the first level.

 The second level of the Castle has a couple of interesting things. If you
answer the riddle correctly ("SHIELDS") you get a magic mouth which can be used
to cast the SOSI spell. You must also obtain the silver square from the
southwest corner of the dungeon. The access to this is from a teleport located
towards the middle of the northern section of the dungeon. The portal to the
third level is located in the northeast section of this level.

 The third level of the Castle contains the entrance to Kylearan's Tower and
some interesting opportunities. The answer to the Old Man's question is "SKULL
TAVERN." When you encounter the berserkers located at 12E 5N of this level, take
advantage. They can be fairly easily defeated with the right magic spells. You
should have at least two sorcerers capable of casting the MIBL spell. It also
helps if your bard has a frost or fire horn to aid the others along. When you
can defeat these guys easily, it is time to make another magic user. You can
teleport from the Castle entrance, fight the berserkers, teleport back to the
entrance, exit the castle, then do it again and again until your spells run low.
At 60,000 experience points a crack, it doesn't take long to develop a decent
magic user. After this, it is time to attempt Kylearan's Castle. When you
approach, and fight the statue of a Mad God located in the southeast corner of
this level, you will be teleported inside the gates of Kylearan's Tower.

 Kylearan's Tower

 After the battle with the Mad God and your subsequent teleport (you did have
the eye in your possession), go one step forward, turn right, then kick the door
down. You will then be entering one of the two most difficult mazes in the game.
Most of it is in the dark and there are riddles that must be answered. Backup
your character disk before entering this maze. Once you are in, watch carefully
for teleports: they are everywhere. It is extremely important that you map this
maze very carefully. After you have reached the antimagic square from wandering
in a very small section of the dark, the next step forward is a teleport to 11E
12N. Explore until you find a magic mouth that asks you to "Name the one of
cold, foretold twofold," The answer to this one is "STONE GOLEM." You will then
be teleported again. After this, you will enter a very large, dark area. In
order to get out of this, you must answer the question posed at 12E 2N which
says, "Name the Endless Byway and your path will be guaranteed." The answer to
this is the only street in Skara Brae with no end, Sinister. You then can map
your way through a lighted section to another dark area. From this dark area you
must obtain the Silver Triangle, located at the very north of the dark area. You
can then exit the dark area, going south from 1E 6N. After this, you will face
the Crystal Golem (did you bring the Crystal Sword?). You can defeat him with
conventional weapons and spells, but somebody has to have the crystal sword or
he will reappear to block your exit.

 At this point, you can exit the tower to refresh your players or continue on.
If you exit, when you reenter you must again answer the endless byway question
to continue. Upon reaching the end of the snaky road on the east side of the
maze, don't go through the south door. Take the door that goes west. You will
then enter several rooms with spinners and teleports that make finding your way
almost impossible. The way past these is southwest. When you make it, you will
be teleported to 14E 1N. It is then an easy stroll to meet Kylearan himself. He
turns out to be the friendly wizard and gives you a key that allows you to get
into Mangar's Tower. He then teleports you to the stairs exiting his tower. You
no longer need the crystal sword or the eye, and you are now ready for Mangar
himself.

 Mangar's Tower

 If you paid heed and followed the stairs from the bottom level of the Sewers,
you will know how to get inside Mangar's walls. If not, go to the Wine Cellar,
teleport your party 17E 16N 3D, and take the stairs up. Then turn right and kick
the door in. You should be at the entrance to Mangar's Tower.

 Level one of Mangar's is fairly easy to find your way around in. Follow the
teleports and walk around until you reach the magic mouth on the east side of
the maze. What is tricky is that after leaving the magic mouth, you are now on
level 2 of the tower. So be careful in mapping.

 Level two of Mangar's is again fairly easy (not even a warmup for level 3).
From this level you must answer the question located at 4E 15N to obtain the
silver circle. The answer to the question is "CIRCLE." You must then make your
way to the stairs located in the middle of the southern side of the maze.

 Level three is the hardest maze of all, but by this time you must be getting
really proficient at mapping. You must wander around this level and obtain quite
a number of items. First of all, you should get the master key, for 50,000 gold
pieces, from 19E 12N. This key allows you to enter Mangar's through the front
gate, instead of from the Sewers. You must then find the clues to the seven
words needed to access the fourth level of Mangar's. Gratefully, you can
teleport into and out of this level of the Tower. After finding the clues, you
can then speak the seven words to the magic mouth located at 10E 4N. They must
be entered one at a time. The words are, "LIE WITH PASSION AND BE FOREVER
DAMNED." Stairs will then appear at 3E 9N. This is the only way to obtain
entrance to the upper reaches of Mangar's.

 The fourth level of Mangar's has only one tricky part. When  you first arrive,
you have a limited number of ways you can go. After reaching a certain point,
located in the northeast corner of the level, doors appear everywhere. Don't be
confused. Everything maps the same, it's just that doors are everywhere.
Eventually you will find the portal to level five in the southwest corner of
this level.

 Level five is the home stretch. This easy maze leads you to the lava pit in the
middle of the eastern side of the maze. There you dive in and are teleported to
10E 6N. You will then find the march up the hall of harm to be fruitless if you
didn't bring the three silver items along. If you have the silver triangle,
silver square, and silver circle, a door will appear directly north of you.
After passing through this door, cast your REST spell to restore everybody to
health and proceed directly north to the final battle with Mangar.

 The final battle itself is a large disappointment as it is fairly easy to
defeat Mangar and his vampires, and meet Kylearan again, who gives you 300,000
bonus experience points. After defeating Mangar, you can then proceed one more
square north for the last question of the game. The answer is "SPECTRE SNARE,"
which you then receive (it is good for binding to your party any of your
opponents in battle).


This was a very difficult game to solve...Took me more than a year!

Towns are made up on a 16x16 grid....The numbers on the side show
what space you are currently on.  Have fun!!  Oh Yea, the numbers
that are in ()'s by the name of the city are the teleport numbers,
once your magic user can cast APAR use the numbers in ()'s to go

                                 (Infocom)


NOTE:  You must fill out the first form and write it down, as you will need
it  often.  The  game  begins  when  you  move into a new apartment and are
preparing  to  fly  to  Paris  -  and you can't find the $75 check that was
supposed  to arrive in today's mail! The problem is that your mail has been
inadvertantly  sent  to  a neighbour's house, so you have to retrieve it in
order  to  get  a  cab  to  the Airport. Your new neighbour's are extremely
paranoid  characters, so this isn't easy......in fact NOTHING comes easy in
Bureaucracy!!.  Though  there are only 21 points to score, this is regarded
as one of the toughest Infocom games since Spellbreaker. A seperate 'score'
for your blood pressure goes up one point each time you do something wrong!
Clues are scarce and sometimes only inferred, not actually hinted at in the
text  so  recognising the nature of the puzzle is the only way to grasp the
solution in these cases.

                    THE SOLUTION (As near as dammit!!)

Note:-   Two  areas,  the  AIRPORT  and  SWITCHGEAR  ROOMS,  are  virtually
impossible to describe in detail as there are many random occurences!

         BLACK CAULDRON SOLUTION
         =======================
         by Major Havok

         Well, here is the long-awaited solution for The Black
         Cauldron.  There are many alternative routes to an ending,
         but there is only ONE correct way to get all 230 points.
         One more thing...since B.C. uses mostly the joystick or
         the special commands instead of text, here are the
         commands:
                  |F1|   Sound On/Off
                  |F2|   Display DO/USE/LOOK Menu
                  |F3|   Save Current Game
                  |F4|   USE Object Selected On Status Screen
                  |F5|   RESTORE A Saved Game
                  |F6|   DO Something [talk,enter,exit,open,etc...]
                  |F7|   RESTART The Game
                  |F8|   LOOK At Area Or Object From Status Screen

         So now, there will be no questions about what command you
         are supposed to do! Whenever a sentence does not say which
         command to use, try 'DO' first, 'USE' second.  To USE an
         item, hit [TAB], move the high lighter to the desired item,
         and then hit [RETURN] or push the joystick button.  Now
         when you select USE, that item will be done.  If using 'DO'
         does not work, try 'USE'.  The reverse is also true.

         SOLUTION
         ========

         Before the Castle:
         ------------------

         Well Assistant Pig-Keeper, go inside the house, and talk
         with Dallben.  Grab the pot from the fire, and empty out
         the cupboard on its right.  Exit the house, and go East.
         Enter the pigpen, and feed the pot of gruel to Hen-Wen.
         When she splits for the house, tag along.  Go inside again,
         and watch the fun little pictures.  Take the rope, and
         leave the house.  Go South, and then East to the bridge.
         On the bridge screen, when you first appear, don't make any
         movements, and count to twenty.  If a gwythaint appears,
         RESTART the game (What's a gwythaint you ask? Believe me,
         if one appears, you'll know it).  It will go after Hen-Wen,
         bringing her to the Horned King.  You will not be able to
         get all 230 points easily if she is captured, so its best
         just to RESTART.  If none appear, walk over to the right
         side of the bridge, and search around.  Grab the Food
         Wallet, and WALK BACK TO HEN-WEN!  Pigs don't swim, so if
         you kept walking, you'd lose her!  Go with her across the
         bridge, and then go South, West, and West again. You should
         now be on a screen full of bushes.  To get through the
         thicket, stand behind the stones, then go behind the bush
         east and behind the stones.  Walk to the east end of the
         bush, and head North until your feet are at a blue-colored
         bush.  Go West young man, toward the center of the screen.
         Tah-Dah! Open the door, and go inside with Hen-Wen.  Chat
         for a bit with Gwystyl, and you'll get The Magic Word.  Go
         to the cabinet next to the secret passage, and open it.
         Grab the cookies, and then leave.  You will have to go
         find a gift for the King, so while in the thicket, go west
         until there is a clear area to the North.  Go North, and
         then cross the river. Go North again, and look into the
         hole in the tree.  You will find a Lute, and then USE it
         twice.  That was nice, wasn't it?  Back to the game...go
         North, and then East.  Walk along the southern edge of the
         lake, while going East.  On the waterfall screen, walk
         along the southern edge of the lake again, and go as far
         East as possible.  When you are next to the rock, use the
         Magic Word.  The rock will drop, and you can walk across it
         to the grey cave area to the right of the waterfall.  You
         will drop down into the caves of the Fair Folk.  Talk a bit
         with the King, and then offer him the lute.  He will give
         you some Flying Dust, and a Magic Mirror.  Use a little of
         the dust, and fly out of the cave.  Once outside, use the
         Magic Word again, and walk back across the rock.  Now for
         the hard part...you'll have to find a little furry guy
         named Gurgi, and feed him to make him friendly.  He is
         never in the same place twice, so you'll have to hunt for
         the little bugger.  He can be anywhere in a one-screen
         radius from the waterfall (including it, of course), so you
         will just have to hunt around for him.  When you catch up
         with him, feed him an apple or a cookie.  UNTIL YOU FIND
         HIM, YOU CANNOT GO ON TO THE NEXT SECTION!!!

         The Road To The Castle:
         -----------------------

         Now that you've found Gurgi (If you didn't, you cannot get
         all 230 points!) and fed him, making him your friend, you
         must raid the castle of the Horned King.  Return to the
         waterfall screen, 'cause that's the easiest place to give
         directions from.  At the waterfall, go North twice (don't
         cross the bridge), and West three times.  Pull the dagger
         out of that freaky tree, but ignore the 'NO TRESPASSING'
         sign.  Go West, and then North to the rock maze.  This is
         another area which takes some tricky maneuvering to get
         through.  First, go behind the boulders at the bottom-right
         of the screen.  Move towards the right of the screen, until
         you think you have reached the 'V' in the next row of
         boulders (you should be totally hidden).  Go as far forward
         as you can, then west until you reach the 'V' in the third
         row of boulders.  Go forward again, and then left.  Go
         forward and left again, until you are behind the boulder to
         the farthest left.  Go forward as far as you can go, then
         go right to the center of the screen.  Go forward towards
         the dead tree in the center of the screen, and you have
         arrived!  Now, use the rope, and you will be able to scale
         the cliff.  Remember to go diagonally, or you'll do your
         Humpty Dumpty imitation.  Once at the top, you will be
         faced with a rather nasty looking series of ledges.  This
         is yet another maze screen, but with different directions.
         There are also two screens of this type, each a mirror
         image of the other.  From the rope, walk west until you
         reach the edge of the cliff.  Walk towards the far wall,
         and then climb up it.  Go west as far as you can, and then
         climb down.  Walk west to the edge again, and climb up on
         the wall once more.  Climb up to the highest ledge to the
         right, and go above it.  Climb down, and you will be on a
         VERY tricky ledge.  Carefully walk to the right edge of it,
         and then climb up on the wall again.  Go up and right, and
         then drop down to the end of the cliffs!  Wah-lah!  Walk
         off the screen to the right, and check out the castle.
         Cool, eh?  But, you must press onward...by going forward.
         There is another set of twin screens, each with a twisty
         pathway on it.  Type 'SLOW', which will slow the game, and
         then walk very carefully.  Once you reach the end of the
         path, type 'NORMAL'.  Go forward, and you will see the only
         passible portion of the moat.  [Once in a while, an evil
         dude will pull up to the drawbridge, at the screen to the
         west of this area.  Jump into his wagon, and enter with him
         into the castle, but jump out fast or he will see you.]
         At the moat, wait until the gators are at the sides of the
         screen, and none of them are in between you and the wall.
         Swim across, and if there are no gators in between you will
         be able to out swim them.  Or, just dodge around them until
         you get through.  At the wall, go forward to the next
         screen.  Go climb up the wall, while not going over the
         light colored stones, and also avoiding the rocks thrown at
         you by the bad guys.  Go up to the next screen, where a lot
         of vines have grown.  Keep dodging boulders and light
         colored stones, and go over the yellow rectangle.  Select
         the DAGGER, and then cut the vines away.  A window will
         open up, which will allow you to go...

         Inside The Palace Of The Horned King:
         -------------------------------------

         Welcome to the most unfriendly place you could go beside
         Lybia.  The guards will constantly be chasing after you if
         spotted, but the hanging tapestries provide enough cover so
         that the guards will not be able to see you, and then
         leave.  Or, since you run at the same speed, you could
         simply out move them.  But, when you first enter the castle,
         it helps more to let yourself get captured!!!  Just wait for
         a guard to show up, and walk into him.  You will be taken
         to the high point of the castle--the dungeon!  After being
         put in jail (do not pass go, do not collect $200), grab the
         tin cup, and bang it against the door.  Some spazzy chick
         will open a secret door in the floor, and you might as well
         get out any way possible.  After you know where the door
         is, you can open it whenever you get thrown into jail by
         those spaced-out guards.  Once in the under-dungeon tunnels
         (nice place, eh?), go West twice, North, and North again.
         Take a look at the dude there, and then grab his sword.
         GUARD THIS SWORD WITH YOUR MISERABLE EXISTENCE.  Hit [TAB],
         and select it.  Whenever a guard gets too close, USE it.
         The girl will slip out a door you can't use, so keep
         looking!  Go South twice, and then East.  Turn the gargoyle
         candelabra, and go through the newly opened secret door!
         When you get up there, go to the other gargoyle at the far
         left, and turn it again.  We don't want to go falling into
         a hole now, do we?  While still at the far left, go North.
         The guard will pop instantly, so USE the sword quickly.
         After boinking him upside the noggin, grab the keys off of
         the right wall.  If the guard wakes up, bop 'im again!  You
         have to unlock the door to the North (you'll have to un-
         select the sword though), and unlock the chains holding
         the bard, Fflewddur Fflamm.  In his gratitude, he'll give
         you another musical instrument, a harp.  He'll exit the
         castle (how, even I don't know), and you should walk out as
         well.  Back at the guarded room, you have to go West to a
         flight of stairs.  If the guard gets to close, you know
         what to do (ka-whack!).  Go up the stairs.  About halfway
         up, if you have followed these directions to the letter,
         you should be thirsty.  Hit [TAB], and USE the Water.  You
         might as well eat something as well.  Continue up the
         stairs, and then go East.  There is a small door on this
         screen, in which all your confiscated stuff is.  Open the
         closet door, and grab your gear.  You'll have to re-select
         the Sword at this point.  Ignore that chained gwythaint,
         because if you get too close, it'll catch you like a guard!
         Go through the South door, into the wine cellar (hic!).
         Go directly South, or else a guard will pop up if you take
         too much time.  You should now be at the drawbridge control
         room.  Stand next to the chain and winch, and USE the sword
         to Ginsu the chain.  The drawbridge will drop, and now you
         are on your way to...

         The Marshes Of Morva:
         ---------------------

         To get down from the Horned King's castle, just reverse the
         directions you used to get up there in the first place.
         When you get to the end of the boulders, go South twice.
         USE the Flying Dust, and go South across the Marsh.  Once
         over dry land again, USE the Dust again for a landing
         (landing lights not necessary).  Get your Magic Sword ready
         before you open the door and enter the hut.  Go inside, and
         open the chest.  Ignore the previous adventurers/frogs, and
         wait for the witches to appear.  Talk to them a for a
         little bit, and when they say they will turn you into a
         frog, USE your sword.  Ahhh...the Cauldron at last!  Alas,
         if you wish to get all 230 points, you must simply wait for
         a gwythaint to come and swipe it.  Depressing, wasn't that?
         You must now trudge off to the Horned King's castle again
         to get rid of both him and the Cauldron.

         The Battle For The Black Cauldron:
         ----------------------------------

         You now are returning to the once Good castle for the last
         time.  Instead of going past the gators and climbing the
         wall, go west from the moat screen to the now open
         drawbridge.  Go North, into the wine cellar again (double
         hic!).  There is a secret passage between the second and
         third kegs on the right.  Walk between them, and keep going
         right after the text says you found a passage.  You'll do
         a Star Wars imitation, going right down the garbage chute.
         After falling, you will now be in those lovely little
         tunnels under the dungeon level.  Hit [TAB] and ready the
         Magic Mirror you got from the King if the Fairy Folk.  Go
         South, and then East.  The Horned King will be in here,
         making some truly bizarre home brew (actually, he'll be
         making an army of invulnerable, un-dead soldiers).  When you
         drop in un-announced, he'll get a bit peeved, and go after
         you.  USE the mirror, and the horror of what he sees will
         make him take a swim in the Cauldron.  YECH!  You don't
         wanna think about what is in that pot now!  The walls will
         crumble, but you'll be safe on a floating log.  Enjoy the
         ride (Black Cauldron flume ride-no tickets necessary.),
         until you find yourself on the same screen as that stupid
         Cauldron again!!!  The witches will offer you all sorts of
         junk, but ignore ALL of it.  You'll get your sword back,
         and then you'll reach...

A: You can find the Language of Flowers on page 7 of your Liber Ex
Doctrina. To win the test, you must pick the flower that best answers
the riddle. Good Luck! ou will be guided through the ice maze. If
you don't have the rose, you must use the heart that you found at
Glastonbury Tor. Gold means you are on safe ground. Purple means you
are walking on dangerous ground. 

Q: What do I do at the Southampton Harbor? 

A: Ask the Harbormaster about Galahad. 

Q: Why does the Harbormaster tells me to come back later? 

A: You must first give the crystal heart to the Ice Maiden before
you can travel on the ship. 

Q: Where should I travel to? What is the price for passage? 

A: The Ice Maiden will tell you where to travel to. You will travel
to Gaza. Ask the man about prices. You better have gold coins or you
won't be able to proceed. 

Q: Who should I go with? Jabir or Hazm? 

A: Go with Hazm, he will take you to his master Al-Sirat who will
help you on your quest. 

Q: What should I ask Al-Sirat? 

A: Ask him about Galahad, the Grail, the Goddesses and the Guardians.
Be sure you write down the goddesses names and their symbols. 

Q: Should hire Jabir as a guide? 

A: No. 

Q: How can I cross the desert? 

A: After you come to the first screen of the desert go East 1 screen,
then South 1 screen, then East again. You should come to a pool with
a camel skeleton next to it. 

Q: OK. I've made it to the pool with the skeleton nearby. Now what?


A: Don't drink the water, it is poisoned. Draw your sword to get
Jabir out of the way. Travel East past the skeleton where Jabir stood.
Then travel North until you come to a building with a stone platform.


Q: I'm at the building in the desert, what should I do? 

A: Go down the stairs in the lower corner of the opening. You will
see a pool of water. Drink from the pool. Ask about pool and the aqueduct.


Q: I'm at Zion gate and it is blocked by 4 guards, how can I pass?


A: Talk to the guard. Give him 4 copper coins and he will let you
pass to the next gate. Walk to the West along the wall until you come
to Jaffa gate. 

Q: I made it through the Jaffa Gate but I've been robbed! 

A: Draw your sword and the thief will run off. You will not be able
to recover your money. 

Q: I've been robbed! What should I do? 

A: There is nothing you can do to prevent the thief from robbing
stealing your purse. You may chase him into the alley, but you will
never catch him. You must find another way to make money. 

Q: How can I make money? 

A: Sell your mule to Mohammed, the man taking care of your mule.


Q: What is a Dinar, Dirham, or Fal? 

A: Listen to what Mohammed tells you about the money of the land.
He will tell you about the denominations of the Dinar, Dirham, and
Fal. 

Q: What should I do in the Bazaar? 

A: You will enjoy the whole Bazaar more if you first wander around
and talk to as many of the merchants as you can (a few will not be
cooperative and one will not talk to you at all). Wait until last
to talk to the Seeress, who is the old woman selling apples. After
you talk to her, buy an apple. Give her a gold coin. Listen carefully
to her instructions after you eat the apple. 

Q: I've eaten the truth apple, now what? 

A: Go across the street, then West. Talk to Ibrahim, the textile
merchant. The textile merchant will reveal that he needs a veil he
promised his wife. Talk to Sarah, the felafel seller. Buy a felafel
and give it to the urchin. You may buy and eat a felafel yourself,
but be careful how you spend your money. 

Q: What should I do at the pottery seller's? 

A: When you find Farabi, the pottery seller (Fictilia), buy a mirror
from him. You need something to trade Mari for the veil. 

Q: Where can I find Mari? 

A: Go to Mohammed's weapons shop. Yell for Mari. Ask about the veil.
Throw the mirror to Mari. She will throw you the veil. Go across the
street and give the veil back to Ibrahim. 

Q: I've returned the veil, now what? 

A: Find the meat merchant, Fawaz (Tabulae Lanius). Talk to Fawaz.


Q: Fawaz is in a bad mood. What should I do? 

A: Find Hayyam, the fishmonger (Cetarius). Talk to Hayyam. Sweet
smelling herbs should solve this problem. 

Q: Where can I find herbs? 

A: Tariq, the lamp merchant (Lucernae) carries herbs. 

Q: What do I do at the lamp merchant's? 

A: Talk to the Tariq. He will reveal that he needs a religious relic.
Buy herbs and give the herbs to Hayyam. Go back to Fawaz and buy a
piece of lamb. Find Sarah, the felafel seller, and give her the lamb.
Go East on the same side of the street until you come to Ismail, the
relic merchant. 

Q: What should I buy from the relic merchant (Antiquarius Rex)? 

A: A relic. Fingerbones of St. Peter are acceptable relics. Give
the relic to the lamp merchant. The lamp merchant will give you a
broom. 

Q: OK. who wants my broom? 

A: Go to the Inn (Caupona) and knock on the door. Give Achmed the
broom. If you feel like it, spend the night there. When you leave
the Inn, go East. Talk to the leprous beggar. 

Q: What do I give the beggar? 

A: Give the beggar a bag of charcoal. You may buy charcoal at the
lamp merchant's (Lucernae). After you give the beggar the charcoal,
go back to Mohammed's weapons shop. You will see a crying girl. Notice
that her birds have escaped. Grain will help Ione retrieve her birds.


Q: Where can I find grain? 

A: Ali, the grain merchant (Horreum) will gladly sell you grain.
After you buy a bag of grain return to the crying girl (Ione) by Mohammed's
and scatter the grain on the ground next to the cage. 

Q: Where should I go after completing all the tasks in the bazaar?


A: Go back to the Seeress. Talk to her and she will give you the
Strength apple. Do NOT eat it yet! The Seeress will tell you to go
to Fatima's. 

Q: Which house is Fatima's? 

A: Fatima's door is marked by the star and crescent. 

Q: What should I do at Fatima's? 

A: Say no to all of her seductions. Ask her about the Grail, Test,
Galahad, Catacombs and the Hierophant. Give her the purse and enter
the door that opens to take the test. 

Q: How can I pass the Test of Symbols? 

A: To pass the test, you must have the symbols that Al-Sirat gave
you when you asked him about goddesses and the information found on
pages 9 and 10 of your Liber Ex Doctrina. When you have the symbols,
put the correct symbol in the correct square. Fatima will tell you
if you passed the test. 

Q: Where is the Hierophant? Where are the catacombs? 

A: The Hierophant is the old beggar who wanted charcoal. Talk to
him and ask him to open the catacombs. If you have passed the Test
of Symbols, he will give you the elixir. 

Q: What should I do in the catacombs? 

A: You should use your lodestone to find your way around. Look at
the murals. You should locate a child's mummy with a medallion and
a sarcophagus that opens. Search the catacombs until you find Galahad.


Q: What do I do when I find the child's mummy? 

A: Stand close to the right of the child's mummy (not too close).
Use your sword to get the medallion. 

Q: What do I do when I find the sarcophagus? 

A: Read the inscription on the lid of the sarcophagus, go up to the
open end of the sarcophagus. If you have the medallion you can get
the Golden apple, if not... well you can always restore. 

Q: I have found Galahad, what should I do? 

A: Give Galahad the elixir that the Hierophant gave you to save his
life. 

Q: I keep getting bitten by a rat when I try to rescue Galahad! 

A: There is nothing you can do to avoid being bitten by the rat when
you enter this chamber. From now on, your time is limited so do not
delay. Give Galahad the elixir and leave this room. Find the statue
of Aphrodite. 

Q: I've found the statue of Aphrodite. What should I do? 

A: Put the golden apple into the palm of her hand. You can get the
golden apple from the sarcophagus. 

Q: I can't answer Aphrodite's questions. 

A: You can find the answers to her questions on page 10 and 11 of
your Liber Ex Doctrina. 

Q: How do I get out of the catacombs? 

A: After you have saved Galahad, go to the statue of Aphrodite and
put a golden apple into her palm. Answer all of her questions correctly
and she will give you the directions on how to get out of the catacombs.
Listen carefully and make a note of the directions she gives you.
When the secret doors open, use the lodestone to determine which door
to take. The lodestone will always point North. Take the stairs out
of the catacombs after looking at the dead warrior's skull. 

Q: What should I do in the Temple? 

A: Walk all around the Temple so that you have seen each part of
it. When the Saracen appears and challenges you to battle, eat the
Strength apple. Eat it before you put on the helmet. This is also
a good place to Save your game. Put on the helmet the Saracen offers
you. You are then locked in battle to the death. For instructions
on how to fight the Saracen, Read page 21-23 of your Liber Ex Doctrina.
If you have difficulty defeating the Saracen, adjust the arcade mode
to an easier setting. 

Q: I keep dying of poison! 

A: If you die of poison you must restore to the catacombs and try
to accomplish your tasks after being bitten by the rat more quickly.


Q: What do I do once I defeat the Saracen? 

A: Use the dove that Aphrodite gave you. Follow the dove until Aphrodite
appears. Listen carefully to her words. Ask Merlin about the Spiral.
Facing the spiral on the inside of the Temple (not from the stairs),
move to the left. Count the places where each pillar once stood until
you come to the remains of the sixth pillar. Push the pillar. 

Q: Where is the Grail? 

A: Beneath a broken pillar in the Temple. 

Q: A thief has stolen the Grail! What should I do? 

A: There is nothing you can do to prevent the thief from stealing
the Grail. Chase the thief down the stairs and into the alley. Once
you have trapped him in the alley, you may either kill the thief of
show mercy by picking up the Grail.

 CHAMBER OF THE SCI-MUTANT PRIESTESS
                Part 1

 CHAMBER OF THE SCI-MUTANT PRIESTESS is an unusual adventure game from France
that employs a state-of-the-art interface and graphics to tell its twisted
story. This walkthru will help you navigate the various hazards and ordeals of
CHAMBER as you attempt to find and free your friend, Sci-Fi, and escape the
clutches of the Protozorqs.

CompuServe              TEG-6461

 The walkthru is divided into four parts. The first part describes the overall
game and some tips on items and trading. The second part details the five
ordeals. The third part covers the rest of the game following the five ordeals.
The fourth part describes a short-cut to finishing the game without passing the
five ordeals.

 BEGINNING THE GAME

 At the beginning of the game, the Master of Ordeals gives you one item which
assists with a particular ordeal. I recommend that you start the game with an
item that you retain after completing the ordeal. Specifically, you should start
with the dagger, the lantern, the rope, or the goblet. The dagger is best, but

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe              TEG-7498

the others will do.

 If you are given the fly, attack the guards, then surrender. You will die and
the game will restart, hopefully giving you a different item. You can win
starting with the fly, but it is more difficult.

 Excepting the need to avoid starting with the fly, you can perform the ordeals
in any order. The key is that you want to have an item in your possession when
you turn in a skull. This will permit you to trade your item for one needed for
a new ordeal. Otherwise, you must attempt to find and slay an aspirant, and hope
they are carrying a useful item (and that they don't slay you!).


Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe              TEG-7499

 TRADING ITEMS

 Each time you turn in a skull, be sure you have an item available to trade. You
can trade for any of the other five items, so be sure to trade for an item you
need. Before trading (and after giving the Skull to the Protozorq), save the
game. If you fail to guess correctly, restore and try again. The placement of
the skull under the goblet should be the same, so try a different goblet each
time till you find the right one.

 I recommend that you trade for a dagger if you did not start with one. A dagger
may be used to obtain other items, and it's also required in the end game.

CompuServe              TEG-8488

 ACQUIRING ITEMS

 You start with one item. As mentioned earlier, this should be anything except
the stone fly. After you complete your first ordeal, trade for the dagger. Once
you have a dagger, you should walk around the ring looking for an Aspirant. If
you find one, THROW the dagger at him. Then, SEARCH the body to retrieve your
dagger, and take the item he was carrying.

 You can use this trick repeatedly, though it does take time, and you only have
an hour to complete all five ordeals. If you are careful about preserving your
items and saving before trades, you should end up with at least a dagger when
all the ordeals are finished.

                Part 2

 The five ordeals can be completed in any order. The game will start you with
one item (at random), which will usually dictate the ordeal with which you
start. Note, though, that I recommend not starting with the stone fly. Also, you
should save after each successfully completed ordeal. It is all too easy to
"mis-click" even when you are trying to do the correct thing: Death is always
lurking in the shadows in the CHAMBER!

 THE WALL

 To complete the Wall, you need the dagger. You start with an open hallway and
two doorways. You should see three arrows in a line in front of you, which I
will refer to as the top, middle, and bottom arrows. Click on the top arrow.
Then, click on the middle arrow. The panels should be completely closed in front
of you.

 Walk through the door on the left. CLIMB ON the step at the bottom of the
facing fresco. Now, PUT IN the dagger (into the slot near the knight's head and
shoulder). This will cause you to be flipped into another room.

 First, before moving or doing anything else, TAKE your dagger from the objects
in the Room Icon. Then, take the passage on the extreme left. It is hard to
distinguish the two passages; be sure your arrow cursor is over the narrow dark
band on the left. In this chamber you should STICK YOUR HAND IN the deep cavity.
Voila, you have a skull. Click on the passage at the bottom of the screen. Then,
click on the middle passage to return to the Master's Orbit.

 Before returning to the Master's Orbit, you may wish to find an Aspirant. If
you see one, THROW knife, and SEARCH the body. You should recover your knife and
whatever item the Aspirant was carrying.

 THE NOOSE

 To complete the Noose you will need the lantern. Without it, the room is dark,
and you will die unless you leave immediately. Solar Eyes will work, but don't
waste the energy.

 GRAB HOLD of the rope on the left, then PUSH the lever. REMOVE ROPE from the
Poormouth, INSPECT the Hollow (which is right by the platform), and you will
find a skull. Leave through the door on the left to return to the Master's
Orbit.

 THE TWINS

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-13413


 You will need the goblet to complete the Twins. When you enter, you will see
two snake's heads. OPEN the one on the left. Go through the door on the left to
the Source. INSPECT the Fountain, then PRESS THE EYE. Now, FILL GOBLET with the
water. Take the right-hand door to return to the Twins.

 EMPTY the goblet into the open snake (on the left). TAKE the die. THROW the die
(this is the clue on which hands to lift in the next room). OPEN the right
snake. PUT IN the die into the right snake's mouth, and go through the door
ahead of you to "Who Will Be Saved?"

 LIFT the far left and far right hands. PRESS the Serpent's head, INSPECT the

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-13414

engraving that is revealed, and note its shape (it is randomized). Now, take the
door on the right back to the Source.

 INSPECT each cube on the floor. You should see that each has a shape carved in
its face (wavy lines, a square, etc.). LIFT the cube whose shape matches the one
you saw in the other room. You now have a skull, congratulations! Take the
passage behind you to the Ring.

 DE PROFUNDIS

 You will need the rope to complete De Profundis. To start, simply click on the
Wait Icon. Now, LASSO the rope to the hook that descends from the ceiling. WAIT

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-13415

until the platform disappears and the Granite Monster rises up.

 JUMP ON the Granite Monster that rises from the waves. Then, TAKE your rope,
WAIT again, and you will be given a skull and be deposited in the Ring.

 IN THE SCORPION'S PRESENCE

 You must have the fly to pass this ordeal. First, TALK TO the Statue (not the
mouth). The door ahead of you should flash. Pass through the door to the
Spider's chamber.

 Once inside, CRAWL. GIVE the fly to the woman. When she offers to have you kiss

her, REFUSE. Then, GIVE THE FLY TO THE BLUE ONE (receiving the red spider). Exit
the door on the right.

 Put the fly in the Scorpion's mouth. When the trapdoor opens, PASS through it.
You will get a skull and wind up in the Ring.

 AFTER THE FIVE ORDEALS

 Before turning in your last skull, be sure you have a dagger. If necessary,
trade for one, turn in your last skull(s), and become a Divo!

 Congratulations on completing the five ordeals! You are halfway there. Your
friend, Sci-Fi, awaits you in the rooms beyond the guarded passage. Before
starting, be sure you have two items: the egg (which you got for completing the
five ordeals), and a dagger.

 When you approach the passage out of the Ring, there will be a guard there. If

there is more than one, walk away and return until there is only one. Then,
THROW the dagger at the guard, SEARCH the guard to get the dagger back, and TAKE
the Zapstick.

 Take the passage. In the passage, take the left opening (_not_ the door as you
were instructed to do by the Master of Ordeals). Take the next left passage.

 At the bars, PULL the bolt back, and PASS through the bars. You will find
yourself swimming in The Return with Deilos! But not to worry: Using your Sci
Power of EXTREME VIOLENCE and having the Zapstick, you will certainly give
Deilos something to think about.

 Now, DIVE. In the soup below, you will need to Zone Scan to find a way out.
Take the passage. Go straight ahead, left at the branching, straight again, then
once more into the large chamber.

 ACCEPT when told to put down your weapons, then TELL THE TRUTH. You have won
the grudging acceptance of the two defective tuners, but they still know
something you don't. To find out what that is, ZONE SCAN the room.

 LIFT the slab. TAKE the Bean, the Flask, the Zapstick, and the Dagger. GIVE
BEAN TO EAT to the Mummy, then GIVE FLASK TO DRINK. It is time to move on. Take
the passage to the left.

 Go straight and through the trapdoor. You should be in the Refectory. Go into
the Threshold of Truth (the arrow pointing down) and ATTACK the Priestess. PUT
IN the egg into the Open Mouth and INSPECT the lectern. If you look up and to
your left, you should see a small figurine near the ceiling. Use Sci Shift to
retrieve it. Take the passage out of this alcove.

 Back in the Threshold, take the door on the right to Placating the Powers, and
ATTACK the first priestess. When Saura comes for you, Brain Warp her, then GIVE
FLASK TO DRINK. TAKE the Mask and Sacrificial Blade.

 Return to the Threshold, then go to Saura's Repose (left door). In Saura's
Repose, PUT IN the Statue of Saura into the Niche, and have the Monkey GET IN

 In the Threshold, WAIT one turn. The starry door will open. Take the passage
through it into the Birth of the Divine Race.

 Here, you will need to WAIT one turn until Zorq and his henchman Harssk come
in. Use Extreme Violence on Zorq. When Harssk grabs Sci-Fi, Brain Warp him.

 Sci Shift the trapdoor at the top of the ladder. WAIT till Qriich-Harssk is
distracted at the top (and releases Sci-Fi). THROW the dagger (or the
sacrificial blade).

 It is possible to finish CHAMBER without completing the five ordeals. To do so,
you will need to have a dagger. You can restart the game until you are given
one, or you can complete one ordeal and trade for it.

 Once you have a dagger, enter the passage leading outside of the ring. You
should find one guard there. If there are two, walk away and return until there
is only one. Then THROW the dagger at the guard. SEARCH the guard to get the
dagger back, and TAKE the Zapstick.

 Enter the passage and take the left opening (_not_ the door as you were
instructed to do by the Master of Ordeals). Take the next left passage.

 At the bars, PULL the bolt back. Then PASS through the bars. You will find
yourself swimming in The Return with Deilos! But not to worry: Using your Sci
Power of EXTREME VIOLENCE and having the Zapstick, you will certainly give
Deilos something to think about.

 ACCEPT when told to put down your weapons, then TELL THE TRUTH. You have won
the grudging acceptance of the two defective tuners, but they still know
something you don't. To find out what that is, ZONE SCAN the room.

 THROW the dagger at the Master of Ordeals, then SEARCH him. TAKE the Whistle.

your left, you should see a small figurine near the ceiling. Use Sci Shift to

 Go back to Placating the Powers, then return to the Threshold of Truth. Sci-Fi
and her monkey will follow you. Go to Saura's Repose through the left door. In
Saura's Repose, PUT IN the Statue of Saura into the Niche, and have the Monkey
GET IN THE TUNNEL. Return to the Threshold.

 CIRCUIT'S EDGE
     Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 CIRCUIT'S EDGE is a graphic adventure whose story is set (roughly) in 2702
A.D., in a city called Budayeen, somewhere in the Islamic world. You are Marid
Audran, a private detective. Budayeen is a seedy place full of unsavory
characters, and you're not exactly pure as new-driven snow either. Drug use,

CompuServe             TEG-10879

sex, and drinking are favorite pastimes, and some inhabitants are really into
inserting chips in themselves to acquire various skills and personalities.
(Players of NEUROMANCER may detect some similarities here.) And you, being a
carefree, try-anything-once kind of guy, are into everything!

 This game is in real time -- that is, the game clock keeps ticking away even if
you're just staring at the screen. Be sure to pause the game when you have to
leave for a short time. Certain game elements are sensitive to game time and
must be accomplished without breaks. These will be so indicated in the walkthru.
Saving the game is only allowed when you are in your own apartment; there is
only one save-game slot. When you are on a time-limited task, don't waste time
by returning to your apartment to save the game.

 All commands for the game are chosen from menu bars at the top of the screen.
Although this type of interface is common to a variety of games, there are some
unusual features unique to this game. These features will be pointed out at the
appropriate spots in the walkthru.

 You need the street map (north is at the top of the page) and the business
directory in the manual to travel. There is a small map window in the lower
right corner of the screen showing your immediate surroundings, to help you
orient yourself while traveling. Movement is done by using the arrow keys or by
clicking either on the main screen or on the small map window (I prefered using
the arrow keys).

 In the walkthru, commands that you select from the menus are in capital
letters. From time to time, you will need to TALK to someone ABOUT certain
things. These are noted in capital letters and quotation marks.

 While in the game, punks randomly ambush you on city streets. Early in this
walkthru, we'll equip you with the KUNG-FU MASTER chip; this should make you
almost invincible to these punks. After each fight, get all the money and a
stiletto or switchblade (if you don't already have one); leave other things
behind. If you find your life meter bar has fallen to less than half, go to the
Medical Clinic, and TALK to the NURSE to BUY NUCLEAR HEALING. Because of their
random natures, fights and healing are not included in the walkthru.

crystal ball. He tells you the odd woman is Madame Mimi in the Tarot Den. EXIT
and go there. TALK to MADAME MIMI. INVENTORY. GIVE her the CRYSTAL BALL. She
pays you back the kiams you spent for it. TALK about "COLOGNE." The nervous
Madame tells you that you have to come very close to death to find what you are
looking for. I know just the place. EXIT and go to the Cemetery.

 You get here by exiting the West Gate at the west end of The Street. It is
mentioned only once at the very bottom of page 10 in your manual. LOOK. You see
the man who j

three times, and he runs away, but he drops his radio direction finder. It is

 TALK to SAMPSON. BUY RADIO DIRECTION FINDER. BUY WIRES, too; they will come in
handy later. EXIT, INVENTORY, and USE RADIO DIRECTION FINDER. You see a red
arrow at the top of the screen. The red arrow points at compass directions
(north is at the top). Use the arrow to home in on the warehouse between North
14th and North 15th Streets; then go there. You can't get in; set off a small
explosion to blow the door. Now what? Well, there's still that Cuban cigar box

USE HOLOVIEWER. The nurse sees the picture of Tamara and recognizes her, but she
will not give you any more clues unless you give her a pair of emerald earrings.
(Does this game ever end?) EXIT, return to Jewels of Morocco, and TALK to
JEWELER about "EMERALD." He sold the last pair to a street dealer in one of the
clubs. It figures. Go back to Chiriga's and TALK to STREET DEALER about
"EMERALD." This is the guy that bought the earrings from the jeweler, but he
will not cooperate. TALK to him again. INVENTORY. GIVE him 50 KIAMS to learn he
sold it to some blond dancer.

 Well, by sheer trial and error, the blond dancer is Kandy. When you TALK to
KANDY about "EMERALD," she will tell you that Lily has it. When you TALK to LILY
about "EMERALD," she will tell you to get her something green with which to
replace it, and call you a "pet." Unfortunately, these dancers move from place
to place and often disappear altogether only to return the following night. I
suggest you try Chiriga's, The Red Light Lounge, Frenchy's Nightclub, and Big
Al's Old Chicago. If you can't find her/them, try again the following night
starting at 7:00 p.m. Meanwhile, back at Chiriga's....

 After talking to the Street Dealer and/or Kandy/Lily, EXIT. As you exit, a
hooker will come up to you and ask for your commcode. She says she has something
special for you. Say YES to give her your commcode. The hooker will call shortly

CompuServe             TEG-10919

afterwards, probably while you are still searching for Kandy/Lily. You deduce
that she lives in 247 Salah Ad-Din Apartments. I said "deduce" because the call
was cut short very abruptly.

 Go to the Salah Ad-Din Apartments, and after the description of the lobby, LOOK
will take you to the hooker's room. You are not surprised to see another murder,
are you? LOOK again to discover the Samurai tattoo on her body. EXIT and go to
Franco's Tattoo Parlor. TALK to FRANCO about "SAMURAI." He gives you some
information obviously linking Kenji to the hooker, but it serves no other
purpose in the game. EXIT.

 We now pick up the story after you have talked to Lily. She wants something

green in exchange for the emerald earrings and she calls you a pet. Now what can
that be?

 HOUSE OF SNAKES

 TALK to SHOPKEEPER. BUY GREEN SNAKE. EXIT and get back to Lily, wherever you
last found her. TALK to LILY. INVENTORY. GIVE her GREEN SNAKE. She faints at the
sight of the snake and that makes it easy for you to grab the earrings and run!
EXIT and go back to the Medical Clinic. TALK to NURSE. INVENTORY. GIVE her
EMERALD EARRINGS. Finally, the nurse tells you that Tamara has changed
completely, and is now Arissa. You have probably run into her a few times in the
clubs.

 Arissa is frequently in Chiriga's, but you may have to search in the other
clubs too. When you find her, TALK to ARISSA, and you learn a lot about the
murder cases. Arissa promises to call you after she retrieves the notebook from
her apartment. Shortly afterward, Arissa calls and tells you to go to 1744, the
Gray House.

 After the description of the lobby, LOOK will take you to Tamara/Arissa's room.
Well, at least she has not been murdered like the others...yet. You learn she
has been taken to the warehouse on South 1st Street by Abu Salah. Wait a minute:
You've seen his name. He is the owner of Abu Salah's Rug Shop. Better get over
to the warehouse fast!

 LOOK. Here it is at last: the final confrontation. You have to fight Abu Salah
to the death. Again, with Kung-fu Master chipped in, that's not much of a
challenge. ACTION. GET NOTEBOOK. Wait, Abu is not quite dead yet. He starts the
torturing machine. Tamara will die soon if you cannot stop it. What and where is
this black key that Tamara is talking about?

 From now on, you have 60 minutes of game time to get the black key and bring it
back to save Tamara. The black key is in Abu Salah's Rug shop. Enter the shop,
and LOOK will get you the key. Bring it back to the warehouse. INVENTORY. USE

 Just one last thing to do now. Have Bill take you to Friedlander Bey. TALK to
PAPA. That's it; another long drawn-out murder case solved. Just sit back and
watch the ending.

 Some additional info not included in the walkthru:

 1. You can also SHOW the RANSOM NOTE to SAIRD to elicit some interesting
responses. Use the belt phone to call him to find out where he is. You can only
reach him after 6 or 7 in the evening.

 2. The clue you get by typing "Tamara Carter" into the police computer -- that
she lives in the Red Dunes Apartments -- leads to nowhere. By talking to other
landlords, you will find that the Red Dunes Apartments has been renamed The
Saharah's Apartments. Going there does not lead you to Tamara. Talking to the
landlord there yields no further clues either.

 3. Try typing in Friedlander Bey and your own name (Marid Audran) into the
police computer for some interesting reading. Typing in the terrorist's name
does not accomplish anything, which is odd, since he was killed by the police
during a shootout.

 4. You can play blackjack or baccarat in The Gambling Den. It is very hard to

win and gambling has no bearing on the outcome of the game.

 5. The writing on the wall "MCDIX" turns out to be a number in Roman numerals.
That seems to be such a tantalizing clue all throughout the game, but you don't
even need to guess it. Buying and chipping-in the Julius Caesar chip tells you
the true nature of "MCDIX." It serves no purpose in finishing the game.

 6. To successfully set off the explosion, you need the explosives (naturally!),
wires, countdown timer, and detonator. You must also chip-in the demolitionist
chip.

        ===========================================================
          175 Tips, Hints, and Tools for Ruling Your Civilization
             or The Official Guide to Sid Meier's Civilization
      ===============================================================

  This is only one section from the book THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO SID MEIER'S
  CIVILIZATION. Contained here are 175 Tips, Hints, and Tools (?) for
  Ruling Your Civilization. The complete book will come soon.




YOUR FIRST MILLENNIUM

 1. Put down roots quickly. Your first city doesn't have to have the world's
    greatest location: Better to get it up and running, pumping out new units
    and improvements, than to lose valuable time.
 2. Pursue writing before other cultural advances. No matter where you start -
    island or continent - the development of writing lays the ground work for
    enhancing and expanding an exuberant intellectual culture composed of
    libraries, universities, and intellectual Wonders of the World which will
    serve your long-term goals on more levels than any other development in
    the game.
 3. Decide as quikly as you can what type of game you are going to play. If
    you are going to pursue world conquest, for example, you should begin
    building your armies and assembling your resources before the first
    millennium ends. If you're going to play a game of peaceful expansion and
    consolidation, you should shore up your homeland's defenses against those
    enemies less benevolent than yourself.
 4. Multiply, multiply, multiply! The race in Civilization often goes to the
    most fecund. By the end of your first millennia you should have at least
    three cities functioning and growing, with more on the way.
 5. Because reproduction and creation of new cities is so important, don't
    spend valuable settler time developing every square around a city. You can
    create additional settlers to do that later. Do enough development to get
    the city on sound economic footing, then move on to start another
    community.
 6. Place defensive perimeters around your emerging civilization. Expand those
    perimeters as your civilization grows.
 7. Build roads as you can afford the commitment of settlers. Not only do the
    roads increase your productivity, they also lay the groundwork - roadwork,
    as it were - for the rapid movement of forces should you be invaded.
 8. Put one city to work building a Wonder of the World as early as possible.
    The addition of wonders does much to boost your score, yet if you wait too
    long to create them, they may be acquired by other civilizations.
 9. Develop pottery by all means. You must have granaries if you are to hold
    any hope at all of increasing your population and growing your cities.
10. Be prepared to shift strategies: The road to failure is paved, sometimes,
    with peaceful intentions, and not every would-be conquerer can actually
    manage to conquer. Play with the flow of the game, not against it.
11. Alternate your cities' labor force between agriculture and resource
    development until the population is large enough to attend to both.
    Agriculture results in increased population; resource production boosts
    your treasury.


YOUR FIRST CITY

 1. Generally speaking, you should build two militia units and fortify them
    immediately, then two more for exploration, before building additiona
    settlers, military units, or city imporvements. (If it quickly becomes
    clear that your civilization is located on an island, perhaps a single
    explorer is sufficent.)
 2. Do not put off the construction of your barracks improvement. Only with
     the establishment of a barracks can you produce veteran military units
     that are strong enough to face the test of combat.
 3. Don't forget to upgrade your defensive units once the barracks is
    completed. Units such as militia that were created before the barracks can
    then be moved to outlying areas or disbanded.
 4. Should the spiritual side of civilization become available to you, put a
    temple in your first city. Establish the people's happiness early on, and
    it's easier to maintain it as the game grows more complex.
 5. If your civilization is surrounded by other, stronger ones, build city
    walls. Although expensive in construction and maintenance, the walls
    amplify your defense force's ability to withstand attack, perhaps buying
    you enough time to prepare a militray response or seek a treaty.
 6. Develop at least two agricultural and one resource square before moving too
    far from your first city. These squares will give the city time to feed
    itself and generate enough income to grow during the early phases of the
    game.
 7. Study the loal terrain. If you've put down roots too quickly, and find
    yourself in a less-than-ideal spot for long-term growth, don't be afraid
    to move your capitol to a more fertile site once one becomes available.
    (Don't move too quickly, though: Make sure the new city is well
    established, defended, and growing before relocating your government
    there.)
 8. As your first city grows - or fails to - adjust the worker allocation. If
    the city is wellfed and prosperous from the beggining, you might want to
    create a scientist to boost the city's intellectual production, hastening
    your advances.
 9. Concentrate on population at least two turns out of three: Your goal is to
    have a civilization-wide population of more than a million by the year 1
    A.D.
10. Build a marketplace as soon as that improvement becomes available. Better
    yet, buy the improvement. The increase in revenue will repay the
    expenditure very quickly.


YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH OTHERS

 1. Always accept the first treaty offer upon initial contact with another
    civilization: It costs you nothing, and gives you time to gather your
    resources, marshal your forces, and prepare a more considered, and perhaps
    antagonistic, relationship with the other civilization.
 2. The treaty established, use your militia to hold enemy expansion in check,
    positioning your units carefully, and fortifying them against enemy sneak
    attack. Use militia because they are easily and quickly produced, freeing
    your cities to concentrate the bulk of their productive time on more
    important units, city improvements, Wonders of the World, or civilization
    advances.
 3. Have some backup for your border guards, especially if your guards are
    militia or diplomats, whose defensive factors are low. Stronger offensive
    units in reserve close to the border, or able to reach the border quickly,
    can make the difference between a successful enemy invasion and one that's
    turned back.
 4. Once you've established a treaty with a neighboring tribe, get some
    diplomats into enemy territory as quickly as you can. During the treaty's
    tenure, your diplomats - and caravans, if you can produce them - enjoy
    essentially unlimited freedom of movement through enemy territory. This
    gives you the chance to obtain a good portrait of the interior of your
    neighbor, learning whether he is strongr or weaker than you.
 5. If you encounter an enemy at sea, try to follow his vessels back to their
    homeland, particularly if both of you are in triremes. The enemy may
    already have mapped the shortest paths between landmasses, saving you
    valuable exploration time.
 6. Send caravans into enemy territory even if you plan ultimately to wipe the
    enemy from the face of the planet. Earn income while you can!
 7. Use your ships to blockade - or observe - enemy ports. If you're playing
    for world domination, you'll want to contain the enemy to a single
    landmass. If taking a more peaceful approach, the presence of your ships
    will allow you to "shadow" the other civilization's vessels, giving you a
    good and useful picture of their expansions.
 8. Look for natural barriers to enemy expansion - an isthmus, a large lake -
    and place defensive units in the only available paths.
 9. Use your settlers to build forts at strategic points along the border with
    the enemy, then garrison the fort with defensive units.
10. If you can afford the allocation of units, place diplomats on
    fortification or sentry duty at various spots within the enemy
    civilization. They'll keep you posted of enemy troop and settler movement.


SECOND CITY

 1. Build your second city in the most ideal location you can find, making
    up for the haste with which your first city was created.
 2. Put your second city's citizens to work immediately on the constuction of
    a barracks and a granary. Defensive forces should accompany the settler
    unit from the first city. Move them inside the new city, reassign them to
    it, and fortify them. Your new city is instantly defended.
 3. Send settlers from your first city to develop the land around the second
    while it is busy producing the imporvements it needs.
 4. If you have the funds, buy the second city's initial improvements.
 5. At least one of your first two cities should be a port.
 6. Build a road between your first two cities as quickly as possible.
 7. If the enemy lies to the west, consider locating your second city to the
    east, minimizing the chance it will be attacked.
 8. Just as with your first city, establish a defensive perimeter around your
    second to stave off barbarians and unwanted neighbors.
 9. With your first city concentrating its production on units, you might want
    to use the second for Wonders of the World, for educational institutions.
    Or vice versa.
10. use the unit production of your second city to generate defensive forces
    for your third, and so on.


TREATIES AND TRIBUTES

 1. Don't be afraid to reject entreaties from other civilizations. They may
    take your "insolence" as an insult and embark on a war, but they may also
    respect your independence and offer a treaty.
 2. Get to know your neighbors: Some of them can be trusted to honor their
    treaties, while others may stay friendly for no more than a turn or two.
    The computer leaders built into the game have distinctive personalities;
    it will behoove you to be observant as your civilization and theirs become
    acquainted.
 3. Generally speaking: Don't trust Mao, Stalin, Hammurabi, or Genghis Khan.
    And be wary of everyone else!
 4. Occasionally you'll be asked to join another civilization in an alliance
    aimed at yet another civilization. Weigh your response carefully. It may
    be that you can strike a more advantageous alliance elsewhere.
 5. Think twice beefore paying tribute. Civilizations that demand payment for
    peace are unlikely to leave you alone for long. Pay only when you have no
    other choice.
 6. Technology exchanges can be tricky. Your best bet is to exchange
    technology only with civilizations more advanced yet weaker than yours.
    Giving advances to strong, warmongering neighbors is foolish.
 7. Meet with other civilization leaders at least every third time they request
    a conference. It's time-consuming, but otherwise your avoidance is
    interpreted as a rebuff, and will lead to war.
 8. Even possession of the United Nations Wonder of the World can't completely
    protect you from treaty violations, especially late in the game. If playing
    peacefully, initiate negotiations immediately after the sneak attack; the
    enemy will offer a treaty. (This, too, will likely be broken again before
    the war ends.) If playing a warlike game, use the time bought by the
    United Nations to build and position overwhelming military force of your
    own; then use it to crush the enemy.
 9. Pay attention when an enemy's words are backed by nuclear weapons. Some of
    your enemies aren't afraid to use the Bomb, use it without warning, and use
    it more than once. Even if your able to eventually make peace with them,
    the pollution unleashed may ruin your score. Your best bet is to wipe out
    nuclear-powered enemies - if you can.
10. Weave together networks of alliances against strong enemies, especially
    early in a game of conquest. By building a league of weaker nations
    against stronger ones, you may be able to cut down on the time required
    for world conquest, boosting your score.


FINANCIAL TOOLS

 1. A city without a marketplace is financially and socially crippled. At
    higher levels, the same is true of a city without a bank.
 2. Visit each of your city screens every few turns - or more often, if you're
    really serious about winning the economic side of the game - and experiment
    with your population's labor allocations. Some exploitable squares are more
    productive and valuable than others, yet may not be producing for your
    city. Move your people around and boost your income.
 3. If you're planning to sell a city improvement - a step that should be taken
    in only the most dire of economic cicrcumstances - do so quickly, before
    the improvement is rendered obsolete by technological or social advance.
    Obsolete improvements can't be sold.
 4. Produce plenty of caravans, bearing in mind that each city can support
    only three trade routes. Send out caravans from every city.
 5. The game defaults to the three most valuable trade routes, but you can
    waste a lot of time and energy on routes of lesser value that will later
    be superseded. Send your caravans to the most distant and largest foreign
    cities you can find: These generate the largest amounts of income.
 6. The one time you should consider selling city improvements is just before
    they become obsolete. The develop of gunpowder, for example, renders
    barracks improvements obsolete. Since you'll have to replace your barracks
    anyway, why not earn some money from the old ones?
 7. Another good opportunity to sell off improvements occurs when you hold an
    absolute upper hand. Possession of the United Nations Wonder of the World
    is a good example. Since your enemies must offer to make peace with you,
    you may not need items such as city walls, particularly those located far
    away from enemy borders. Sell off the city walls, earn a fair piece of
    change, and relieve your cities of the burden of supporting those walls
    each turn.
 8. As you locate new civilizations with new, large cities, dispatch caravans
    to establish trading routes. These may be more valuable than routes
    already in existence.
 9. Give your citizens plenty of luxuries. This helps them appreciate your
    wisdom, often resulting in "We Love The King" days, which earn you
    generous bonuses.
10. In the latter days of the game, when some of your cities may be capable of
    producing vast engineering works in just a few turns, try building these
    works, then selling them as soon as they're completed. It's impractical
    advice for the real world, but can generate lots of cash in the game.
11. Monitor the amount your civilization costs in maintenance each turn,
    indexing that amount to your cash flow. If your treasury has grown fat,
    don't be afraid to spend, spend, spend for improvements or Wonders. Just
    keep enough cash in your treasury reserves to cover half a dozen lean
    turns or so.
12. If you really have a healthy treasury that can cover a few turns' loss of
    income, try this: Convert everything to luxury income for your citizens.
    They'll reward you with points beyond your wildest dreams.
13. Use caravans to help build Wonders. When a caravan arrives in a city
    building a Wonder, you have the option of assigning it's value to the
    completion of the Wonder. If you can build enough caravans quickly, this
    can hasten completion of the Wonder.
14. As your income rises, adjust your taxation level. Boost your science
    allocations, leaving enough in tax revenue to cover the cost of maintenance
    with minimal growth each turn.
15. For cities with more than enough food, turn some of those farmers into
    taxmen. Your treasury will appreciate it.
16. Build rail lines through all developable areas available to a city.
    Productivity will be increased by half.
17. Trade routes among the cities of your own civilizationm, no matter how far
    apart they're located, are raely worthwhile.
18. Invest in factories and manufacturing plants as you are able to build them,
    but create pollution-control corps of engineers (settler units) to deal
    with their effluent. You'll need two settler units per highly
    industrialized city to keep pollution under control.
19. Approaching the space race? Build the largest cash reserves you can - only
    global warfare is more expensive than getting into space.


MILITARY UNITS

 1. Don't produce too many military units without a barracks. Veteran units
    are, essentially, the only ones really worth producing.
 2. Develop mathematics as early as you can. This permits the creeation of
    catapults, the first real "artillery." Only by amplifying your abilities
    through the use of technology - catapults, gunpowder, flight - can you
    enjoy an offensive edge.
 3. Early in the game, use cavalry and chariots to "blitzkrieg" your way
    through enemy homelands. Slower-moving units such as catapults can be
    brought up later.
 4. Upgrade your barracks the moment they become obslete, especially if you
    are at war. Use your treasury to purchase new barracks in those cities
    closest to the front or at the greatest risk of being overrun.
 5. Consider fortifying strong defensive units around enemy cities rather than
    laying direct assault to those cities, especially if the city possessed
    defensive walls or a large number of fortified units. Seal off the city
    and starve it slowly with phalanx-level units if possible.
 6. Build plenty of seagoing units. Naval power cannot be under-estimated
    in the world of Civilization.
 7. Consider keeping a strong naval unit on sentry duty inside your own
    harbors, especially if the war is going poorly. These units can spring to
    life from withing the city, attacking enemy vessels which might bombard
    your port.
 8. Use the "go-to" function to place units n patrol, covering large amounts of
    territory or sea with minimum input from you.
 9. Disband military units no longer needed or of unlikely value to your
    civilization. Don't forget to disband older defensive units in cities
    being garrisoned by more advanced units.
10. Keep a strong offensive unit on sentry duty - not fortified - along with
    your fortified defensive units in each city. The offensive unit will
    "awaken" at the approach of the enemy, and can attack in some cases before
    the enemy assault begins.
11. Cities susceptible to frequent attack by barbarians might need more than
    one offensive sentry either inside or close to the city. You need to kill
    the barbarians before they can pillage your developed countryside.
12. Never stack military units in an open terrain. They are far too vulnerable
    to being destroyed at a single blow, sometimes by a less-powerful enemy.
13. Blockade harbors with city walls; bombard thcse without them.
14. Especially in the age of transports, when a single vessel can carry eight
    units, escort your shipping with cruisers or battleships. Your advanced
    military vessels "see" farther than other units, and can alert you to the
    presence of enemy warcraft lying in wait for your convoy.
15. An aircraft carrier bearing bombers and fighters makes another good
    screening device for convoys.
16. Because of their extremely long range, nuclear missles are among the best
    advance observers. Launch them from strategically located cities, or from
    aircraft carriers, and use them to explore and observe. Just be sure you
    leave sufficent moves for the missle to return to a friendly city or
    carrier.
17. And be careful if you use nuclear missles in the manner described
    immediately above. One slip of your typing finger, and instead of
    surveillance your missle could unleash holocaust.
18. If your information reveals that an intransigently warlike enemy has
    developed nuclear weapons, launch a crash SDI building program. Only SDI
    can save your cities from nuclear attack.


YOU CAN'T RUN A CIVILIZATION ON AN EMPTY STOMACH

 1. A city without a granary grows slowly at best.
 2. Your granary holds several turns' worth of food. If your granary is filled
    to bursting, shift your citizens to mineral resource work or convert them
    to specialists for a few turns, living off your surplus agriculture
    products. Just don't forget to return them to the fields before famine
    strikes.
 3. If you're having trouble getting a city's population to grow, shift all of
    the citizens to the fields. You may lose a little economic revenue, but
    before long your granary should begin to fill, and you can readjust the
    assignments of a larger, better-fed labor force.
 4. Look for the most efficent routes to follow if bringing irrigation to your
    city's enviorns. Don't build more elaborate irrigation channels than
    necessary.
 5. Clear pollution from agricultural squares before otther squares.
 6. Replace granaries immediately should they be destroyed. Granaries should
    be replaced before any other structure.
 7. When creating specialists, look at your granary supply. If it's full, take
    an agricultural square out of production. If you're short on food, remove
    a mineral or other resource square from the work force.
 8. When laying extended siege, pillage or occupy enemy agricultural squares,
    cutting off the city's food supply.
 9. Take advantage of seafood: Those fish symbols in oceans and lakes
    contribute mightily to cities located near them.
10. Irrigate oases when you have the chance.
11. If your granary is well stocked with foood, onsider onvrting one or more
    agriultural squares into forests. Just keep an eye on food levels after
    you do so.


WONDERS OF THE WORLD

 1. The most valuable Wonder of the World of the ancient world is the Great
    Library, especially if playing against a large number of enemy
    civilizations. You can't beat the boost in knowledge you get when two of
    those other civilizations make the same advance.
 2. The most valuable Wonder of the World of the Middle Ages is Johann
    Sebastian Bah's Cathedral, especially if you're ruling a republic. You
    can't beat it for generating quite a few "We Love The King" days, with
    their concomitant increase in population.
 3. The most valuable Wonder of the World of the modern world is the Apollo
    Program, if you're playing a space race game: Only with Apollo can you
    begin building your starship.
 4. If playing a game of world conquest, the most valuable latter-day Wonder
    may well be, ironically enough, the United Nations. Because this Wonder
    forces enemy civilizations to capitulate to you, you can marshal your
    forces almost at leisure, gatthering them at critical spots before
    launching all-out attacks.
 5. Be warned: Violating one treaty when you possess the United Nations Wonder
    seems to violate all of them. When you're ready to make war, make war on
    all fronts at once.
 6. As soon as you have three cities, put one of them - probably your capitol
    - to work building a Wonder. The other cities can produce military and
    settler units, if need be, that can be transfered to the capitol to shore
    up its defenses or further develop the terrain around the city.
 7. Use diplomats to seek out Wonder production in the cities of other
    civilizations. Then either sabotage that production or target those cities
    for capture, and the addition of their Wonders to your empire.
 8. If pursuing a peaceful strategy - trying to win through diplomacy,
    financial strength, and expansion to the stars, focus your attention on
    those Wonders of the World that force your enemies to sue for peace: The
    Great Wall and the United Nations.
 9. If playing a "peacful" game, build as many Wonders of the World as
    possible, concentrating on those that boost your citizens' happiness. Your
    score will benefit greatly.
10. When playing a peaceful game and concentrating on building Wonders, don't
    forget that they must be defended. Put plenty of strong units in and
    around cities holding Wonders of the World.
11. Some Wonders of the Wrold serve all the world: The Apollo Program is a
    good example. Use your diplomats to discover whether other civilizations
    are further along toward completing global Wonders of the World than you.
    If so, devote your resources to creating something exclusive to your
    civilization.


HAIL, CONQUEROR

 1. He who conquers the world fastest conquers the world best: If playing for
    global domination, every turn is vital. You can't stop to smell the roses
    if you want the world at your feet.
 2. Strike the strongest civilizations first, with as much military might as
    you an muster. Use your diplomat skills to keep weaker nations weak, for
    easy destruction after the "big guys" are gone.
 3. Coordinate, coordinate, coordinate! Establish a treaty with a civilization
    you plan to destroy. Flood the civilization with diplomats even as you
    mass your assault forces along its borders. When you hit, hit all at once,
    using diplomats for subversion and sabotage before invading with ground
    forces. Break the enemy's back during the first twrn of the war.
 4. If necessary, sell off improvements in your heartland to finance the final
    stages of a war on the frontier. Use the funds to subvert enemy cities
    first, to bribe enemy units second.


THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES

 1. As soon as you develop aircraft capabilities, begin cranking out fighters
    and, later, bombers. Don't wait a single turn: You can't have too large an
    air force, particularly in heated games of global combat.
 2. Try to garrison a couple of fighters in every city - not just those near
    the front. Fighters can respond quickly to enemy threats, saving you from
    the dangers of surprise attack, or invasion from an unexpected direction.
 3. Your fighters can attack - and keep on attacking. This makes them
    especially valuable when you're facing waves of enemy units. Go for
    stacked units first, of for transport raft that might be carrying several
    units.
 4. If your resources are running low, don't station your fighters or bombers
    too close to the front - in harbors, for example. They are too vulnerable
    there to enemy bombardment. Base them a few squares back in a city or on
    board a carrier. Then, when enemy ships or bombers appear, you can fly out
    to engage them.
 5. Bombers have as much strategic value in Civilization as they do in the
    real world. A squadron of bombers can turn the tide of war, even against
    overwhelming odds.
 6. If you're planning to make war on a civilization with whom you enjoy treaty
    status, take advantage of the peace and get your air force in position to
    attack. Try to target three bombers for each city you're planning to hit,
    more if you can afford it. Attack stacked units in the open first.
 7. Don't overlook the surveillance capabilities of your aircraft,
    particularly the bombers. Their long range makes them perfect for exploring
    the interior of enemy continents and islands.
 8. Carrier power is ideal for isolating and containing an enemy island.
    Position a couple of carriers at either end of the island, support them
    with cruisers to guard against enemy ships, and use their to patrol the
    enemy coastline.
 9. Remember the lessons of Desert Storm: Once you've launched an air war,
    don't let up.
10. Desert Storm Lesson Two: Once the air war has taken its toll, be sure you
    have plenty of fast, mobile ground forces in position to mop up.
11. Desert Storm Lesson Three: In this Civilization, you don't have to stop. If
    your air power has made it possible for you to roll all the way over the
    enemy, do so, assuming that suits your overall strategic plan.


AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA ...        

 1. Never send a loaded tireme out into uncharted waters. It's one thing to
    risk a ship to loss at sea, quite another to risk valuable units. Chart
    your course before moving cargo.
 2. Early on, designate one or two coastal towns as major shipyards.
    Manipulate their population and resources so as to be able to produce ships
    at a rapid rate. (You should have another seaport within easy sailing
    distance, to which newly constructed ships can be reassigned in order
    relieve the shipyard of the burden of support.)
 3. Build fleets in the major oceans and gulfs, along with seaports to support
    and load them. Cut down on the necessity for moving ships all over the
    globe.
 4. As soon as you can build cruisers, battleships, and submarines, do so -
    their extended range of view is invaluable for spoting enemy craft, and
    equally invaluable for opening up any remaining hidden areas of the sea.
 5. Use your advanced naval craft to patrol the coastlines of unexplored enemy
    islands and continents. Advanced ships "see" an adjacent two squares,
    which can give you a good picture of another civilization's coastal
    defenses.
 6. Don't forget naval power during ground assaults. Look for isthmuses and
    narrows through which enemy ground transport must move. Position a
    battleship or cruiser on either side of the landmass and open fire on
    enemy units stranded in your sights between turns.
 7. If bombarding a fortified harbor with a value of nine or higher, bring at
    least two warships. You'll likely lose one.
 8. Transports are worth their weight in gold, not just for mounting amphibious
    invasions. Fill your ships with caravans and send them to all the corners
    of your world. A successful leader is one whose merchant fleet is as large
    as his navy. And your merchant fleet may be even busier.
 9. Plot your invasion routes so the transport vessels reach landfall on the
    first move of their turn. That lets you move the ships after debarking
    some of their forces, spreading your troops across the broadest possible
    front.
10. Submarines make terrific blockade vessels, but their limited movement
    capability all but requires that you kepp some fast, long-ranged cruisers
    nearby to take their place shoul they be sunk.
11. Be careful, early in the game, about building ships before the immediate
    area around the harbor is fully explored. You might wind up with a
    landlocked tireme stuck in a lake with nowhere to go!


GETTING AROUND                                                           

 1. Use the Go-to key only occasionally. While it takes some of the burden of
    issuing orders from you, it rarely moves your units along the most
    effecient routes, nor does it take full advantage of the movement benefits
    offered by rail transportation.
 2. Pressing H will return your bombers and fighters to the nearest friendly
    city or carrier, if the aircraft possess sifficent movement points.
 3. Moving through a city costs movement points. Build railways around cities
    as well as up to them, letting you conserve movement points for your units.
 4. When engaged in a continental war, continue driving rail lines to the
    front. It's worth commiting extra settler units to this task, especially if
    you're conquering enemy territory at a good clip.
 5. Study the world map as it's revealed. Its layout can give you good  
    guidance in the placement of cities proximate to advantageous sea routes.
 6. Look fro rail lines along the coasts on newly discovered continents or
    islands, or enemy continents or islands you're revisting. Debark your
    diplomats and caravans on squares with railroad track and they'll be able
    to move farther when the next turn arrives.
 7. Centralize your embarkation points for units bound overseas. The central
    locations need not be a city. Run a rail line to a remote area near an
    advantageous shipping lane. Send the units you wish to move overseas to
    that point first, picking them up with your cargo vessel. Of course, you'll
    eventually want to put a city there, and probably should do so sooner than
    later. It's also smart to protect such remote loading zones with a ship or
    two, to prevent enemy craft from sneaking in and opening fire on your
    sentried units.
 8. Build cities on remote islands to serve as island-hopping airbases. These
    need to be the most viable islands for long-term development, but should
    be well fortified against enemy assault. Islands lying just off enemy
    coastlines make the most valuable airbases of all.
 9. Pillage enemy inter-city roads and rail lines if possible during wartime.
    Cutting their lines of transport gives you the chance to catch enemy units
    in the open, unable to move.
10. If forced into a long retreat, pick a spot at which to cut your own
    transportation lines. Doing so in the right place can help you establish a
    "killing field" where the enemy units will be halted and vulnerable to your
    fire.


DIPLOMACY                                                                

 1. The diplomat is arguably the most valuable unit in the game; certainly it's
    the most flexible. Produce plebty of diplomats and send them throughout the
    world.
 2. Don't overlook the value of the diplomat as a "place-holder." On sentry or
    fortification duty, your diplomat will alert you to the presence of enemy
    forces. The advantage is that the diplomat can attempt to bribe teh forces
    over to your side, if you have the money.
 3. Stealing technology is an and violates any treaties in existence between
    you and your target. If you have several diplomats traveling inside enemy
    territory, make sure all are in a position to make their move during the
    same turn. Otherwise you run the risk of losing them to enemy retaliation.
 4. If a city looks vulnerable to subversion, try it. Weaker cities can
    generally be subverted for less money than wealthier ones.
 5. Try to get two or three diplomats in position around each of the enemy's
    major cities just before you invade. Use the diplomats one after another
    to sabotage enemy production and destroy enemy improvements.
 6. Don't use diplomats to uncover serendipity squares. They are too easily
    wiped out by barbarians.


ENERGY                                                                   

 1. In terms of long-term scoring, the best energy sources are those that
    pollute the least.
 2. The game, or its designers, has a built-in bias against nuclear fission:
    Be wary of building nuclear plants until you'vre developed fusion. At the
    very least, build nuclear plants only in the most socially stable of
    cities.
 3. Build Hoover Dam. This Wonder of the World provides clean power to your
    whole continent - and the game defines continent liberally.


RULING                                                                    

 1. Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven: You may not be able to be as
    nice as you want while you play the game.
 2. If you're going to war, do so as a despot of a monarch. Otherwise, the war
    carries too high a social cost.
 3. Alternate your form of government often, depending on your short-term
    goals.
 4. Go for "We Love The King" days, earned by giving your people the "good
    life" of luxuries. You'll end up with more people.
 5. Try a strategy that focuses your attention and production on cures for
    cancer, women's sufferage, and other social benefits. You might be
    surprised at the effect this has on your people's willingness to support
    your choices.


SPACE TRAVEL                                                             

 1. If playing to win by reaching Alpha Centauri first, commit everything you
    have to the space race once it begins. Spend the time waiting for that
    beginning by building up your perimeter defenses against attack. Once
    you've undertaken to build a starship, you'll need the productive output of
    every city you can spare, and you can allow nothing to interefer with that
    production.
 2. Since starship modules take longer to build, start them first. Have at
    least three cities of roughly equivalent size working on module production.
 3. Starship structural pieces are the easiest to build, yet are the pieces
    you'll need in largest quantity. Find a couple of cities that can crank
    these pieces out and get them going.
 4. The more propulsion units your starship has, the faster it reaches Alpha
    Centauri. The more colonists you attempt to deliver to Alpha Centauri, the
    more your starships' weight. Try to install two propulsion units for every
    complete colonist package - habitation, life support, and solar power
    modules - you intend to launch.
 5. Guard your capitol! Losing it brings your interstellar program to a
    crashing close.
 6. Watch the clock. You must reach the Alpha Centauri system before your
    reign expires, or all your work is for naught.                       
 7. Watch the other civilizations' starship development. If they launch before
    you do, you may want to make a mad dash for their capitol in hopes of
    capturing it before their starship reaches its destination.
 8. Consider selling off some improvements in order to buy more colonists and
    life-support modules. The more colonists you deliver to Alpha Centauri, the
    higher your score.
 9. Once your starship is launched, convert all starship-related production to
    other ends. After launch, no further starship production can take place
    unless your craft is lost or recalled by the loss of your capitol. Shift
    your resources and production to items likely to boost your overall score.
    Remember, after launch, the game is counting its way down to the finish
    line.
10. Don't launch unless your arrival time is less than 20 years. If it's more
    than that, add more fuel and propulsion units.
11. Not tired yet? Take a deep breath, reboot and restart Sid Meier's
    Civilization, and begin again, pretending that now your settlers are
    taming an unknown world, in orbit around Alpha Centauri.


TWO GREAT UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES

 1. Tired of facing the same old enemies? Press Alt-R to randomize the
    personalities of the leaders of other civilizations.
 2. In the earliest copies of the game, pressing Shift-1234567890t lets you get
    a complete world map, see into enemy cities, and generally peek behind the
    scenes. This "feature" was discontinued after the first release, but it's
    worth a try just in case.

About The Colonel's Bequest:

Colonel's  Bequest is  a PLAY  divided into  8 "acts." There are
several tasks you MUST accomplish in  each act to cause the play
to progress.

How to progress through the "acts":

In  every act  there are  certain tasks  you must  accomplish in
order for the play to progress to the next act.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

How to "spy" on  people and find  out what's really  going on
behind  those closed  doors? Everytime  I walk  into a  room and
interrupt a conversation, the people stop talking!

Push on  either armoire upstairs  to move it.  Discover a secret
room. You are able to peek through the eyeholes of the portraits
to spy on  anyone in the bedrooms. Do  this often throughout the
play. Downstairs, push on the Grandfather Clock or the mirror to
eavesdrop on conversations.

How to closely examine the items you've found. What to use to
yourself:

find  a monocle  on Wilbur's  dead body  and use  it to  examine
evidence in much the same way.

What to do at the Hedge Garden:

You will see  a small square shaft on the  statue of the dancing
nymph. Insert the valve handle into  the shaft (you can find the

turn the  statue. Towards the  end of the  play you will  find a
dead body  in the Hedge Garden.  Search the body to  find a key.
Get the derringer and the bullet.  Load the gun. Near the end of
the play you will also  discover a SECRET UNDERGROUND PASSAGE in
the Hedge Garden that leads to the basement.

                   ACT 8 (The Final Scene)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What to if I find the Colonel, and he is dead...:

Time is critical, you need to  move a little faster. You want to
interrupt the fight  in which the Colonel is  killed. Try again,
this time: after discovering Lillian's body, get the gun and the
bullet... load the  gun. Search Lillian for a  key, then QUICKLY
go to the attic.

You witness the struggle  in  the  attic  between Rudy and the
Colonel, and Rudy wins... What you should have done:

It's probably not  a good idea to passively  watch. Did you find
the gun?  Get the gun and  bullet in the Hedge  Garden. Load the
gun. Shoot Rudy!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You witness the struggle  in  the  attic  between Rudy and The
Colonel, and you shot the Colonel.. Did you do the right thing?

Nope. Next time  don't shoot The Colonel.... shoot  Rudy and see
what happens.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You witness  the  struggle  in  the  attic  between Rudy and the
Colonel, and you shot Rudy.. Did you do the right thing?

Wise choice... You did the right  thing! Rudy was trying to kill
The Colonel.

Alone in the Dark
(The Walkthrough Ver. 1.0)

	This is a COMPLETE SPOILER to the Alone in the Dark 
game for the PC.  It will get the player through quickly and assumes 
the player either retains all (s)he reads or does not care at all about the 
story that goes with the game.  All unnecessary and used items are left 
behind as soon as possible.  Most things that do not need to be done to 
finish the game are marked as optional.  This is by no means the only 
order of events that leads to a completed game, but it is nearly the 
most efficient.  Distribute this freely and add to it as you wish just 
maintain the credits.  Enjoy!

In the LOFT:  Push the Wardrobe in front of the window to keep out 
the winged beast.  Then push the Chest over the trapdoor in the floor

hand side.  There is a Book in the small bookcase opposite the 
window.  Read and leave the Book (Extracts of Golden Fleece) and the

Open/Search the LIBRARY for several Books to further explain the

(costing life points) -- cool to see though.]  Exit through the closed set 
of double doors, go downstairs, back to the bottom of the STONE 
STAIRS (again).

In the SECRET ROOM:  Take the Talisman.  Open/Search the 
Shelves to get 3 Daggers, Books, and Parchment.  Stand in the Center

Pirate (Captain Norton).  Take the key he had and the book by the 
paintings on the floor.  Read and leave the Book (Demonia

the Hook from the Crypt/Alter.  Put/Drop the Talisman on the 
Crypt/Alter to stop the Fireballs, but you must still avoid the Water 
Creatures.  Use the Lighter to relight the Lantern (if you are out of oil 
at this point, you are in BIG trouble -- try again).  Throw the Lantern 
at the Tree.  Follow instructions and "GET OUT OF HERE!"  Wade to 
the opposite platform you entered on.  Jump up and Use the Hook to 
open the Stone Door.  Go through and to the Left into the Maze and go

1. Open the outside door with Key 1, and then open the door to the Mercedes
using the Key to the Mercedes (!).  Open the glove compartment, and get every-
thing in it. Leave the car.

2. Go left. If you do not meet the whore, go right and go left again. When you
get the hooker, slug her.  Then take purse.  (When you can, open purse, get
gun and $20.

3. Go back to Mercedes.  Go back to the office of the dead guy and open the 
window.  Go on the fire escape, and go up.   Open the window and go inside.
Do not take any of the vials, just Open the trash and get the syringe. Press
the button and enter the elevator.

  Table Of Elevator floors: 1=top button,4=bottom button
        1. Chair with straps    
        2. Office of dead guy
        3. Casino       
        4. Sewer (don't do this)

4. Go to casino.  Waste your quarters (three) on the gambling maching ON THE
RIGHT.  At the third one, you will not have to worry about money any more.

5. Operate the wheel.  enter the doorway, and go downstairs.  (or you can go
to the wine cellar.

6. If you go down the ladder, go for the entrance to the Bar (where the car
is).  If you meet it, kill the alligator with the gun.  

7.  A note about the mugger.  I sock him three times, but when he comes back, 
swearing, I give him a quarter. Hit him on the fourth time, and you're dead.

8. Go west, past the newspapers, past the drunk if you meet him, until you get
to the first cab (blue).  Enter it and go to your home (1212 West End St.) and
get the picture on the fireplace mantel.  To get inside your home, enter the
place and open your wallet.  Operate the card that says "J.S." on the slot.
Do it again in the elevator.  To get back down, just insert the card in the
elevator.  Go into the cab.

9. Go to the address on the picture you just got (520 S. Kedzie). To open door,
shoot it.  Go inside and get the earring, the piece of paper, and open the desk
and get the diary, and small key.  (The house is the secretary's home) If youcan't find all this, kooking everywhere around the desk.

10.  Go to the doctor's office (934 West Sherman) and open the door with the
key from #9.  To open the cabinet, shoot it.  Take all the drug related 
documents (Table below).  Take the Bisodiumitis and the Sodium Penathol.  
 Operate the syringe on the Bisodiumitis and operate the syringe on SELF.  You
are cured, and from time to time you will get your memory back.  Exit.

11.  Go upstairs to the detective's office.  Shoot the person.  (The drunk was
going to tell you that there was a person from Siegel that wss going to rub you
out.  You just rubbed him out.  Open the door with that little key from #9.
Inside, open the desk and get the ammo.  Open the cabinet, take all. Exit.
(Excited?)

12. We have to go back to Joe's Bar.  Look on the map.  Hell, the address is
1060 South Peoria Street.  Go to the bar and into Seigel's room.  Open the
safe with the combo (33-24-36) and get the folder and the box. Inside the box
is a key to the trunk.  While doing this, examine the body.  Also look at the
pic from your house.  Exit back to Mercedes.

13.Open the unmarked box and operate the key on the trunk.  Take off the gag on
the lady (Mrs. Sternwood) and inject her with the Sodium Penathol and copy the
address (626 Auburn Road). Go to the taxi, and go to the address.

14. Open the mailbox, open envelope, take note.  Go to the door, and operate
knocker.  Hit the butler, and go upstairs.

15. Open the far door.  enter.  Open the drawer and take everything, you
can study it later.  Use the other door, and take the pad from the nightstand.
(The lady is Miss Vickers, the Secretary, the man, Mr. Sternwood. (naughty naughty!))

16.  Exit from the other door.  Get out of the house, enter the cab, and go 
back to the bar.

17.  Go into the sewer and go down as far as you can (This place is steamy,
and it looks like a little sewer.  You can find it).  Drop your gun, the
cigarettes, the glasses, the purse, the handkerchief, the gag (if you kept it), the lighter into ther.  Operate the pencil on the pad, and read the pad.
WOW!

18.  Go to the police station, open the doors. IF a siren sounds, sorry.  You messed up somewhere. guide is completely right.  try again!  BUT if it doesn't sound, well, I need not say more.  Yo aejst finished the game!
Print out the diploma, and hang it up.  You should feel a little guilt, though,
CHEATING from some text file.  But who the hell cares?!

		      Hope the file helped.

 Notes of note:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Pause game with Left Mouse Button.
 * Game Starts on MONDAY June 1, 1951 - 10:00 AM
   Places close up on weekends, (but the ants don't!).
 * Call the Weather Station at least every other day for update.
   Do evidence gathering and drop-offs on cold & rainy days and hot days.
 * Ants aren't above ground at night. You might find them in the mines
   if you enter the Ore Plant before dark.
 * Sunrise is 5:00 am ,  Sundown is 7:00 pm.
 * Check the pub if you're desperate for news.
 * Places you can call from:
    1. Pub if Dusty is present.
    2. University Lab if Dr. Wells is present.
    3. Elmer's Service Station if Elmer is present.
    4. Hilber Field if not under attack.
    5. Home if not under attack.
 * Careless handling of RED ROCKS will put you in hot water. But might be
   the ticket for finding the flame thrower.
 * Somewhere there is a Flame Thrower.
 * Elmer supplies fuel for your Flame Thrower, he also likes to take long
   hikes Southwest of town, see elmer run!
 * Imprecise directions to the Ant Hole: It's off the South edge of the main
   map near the South West corner. You can't get there via button click.
 * Precise Directions to the Ant Hole:
     Fly, drive tank or walk, (via Ore Plant), to Mine No.1...
      1. From verticle center line of building, go due South, (about one
         screen), to second cresent shaped rock, (it will be directly in
         your path).
      2. Immediately East of this rock, is a small green clump. (bush?).
      3. Visually draw a verticle line South to a large tear-drop rock,
         (about 3").
      4. About 1/3 South, (call it an inch), between these two points, and
         a bit East, is a large green tree. Immediately South East of tree
         is a very small stone. The next object South and a little East is a
         medium size stone.
      5. Draw a horizontal line West from this stone.
      6. The intersection of these two lines exactly marks the Ant Hole,

           There is no hill or other distinguishing features nearby. When
         closed on cold days, it will look like normal desert texture. It
         opens when the ants are going in or out, and closes immediatly.
           Sometimes it remains open, (? Glitch, Hi-Temp ?), not sure why.
         If you're going to call an Air Strike on it, it's a good idea to 
         mark it with a nice juicy dead ant.

           Hey! I know that took all night long! But if I had said;
         'it's near the tree', you probably would've walked right over the
         sucker and got yourself bitten on the ass!


 * You'll need to get 7 hrs. sleep at least every 48 hrs. or you'll have
   auto accidents, heed the warnings or you'll be ogleing Nurse Judy's
   cleavage again. 
 * More evidence of ants delivered to Dr. Wells yields more ant info. from
   Wells.
 * Our buddy, Mr. Billy Bob Morse, has grand plans for the ants,
   (his daughter told me in an intimate moment). He isn't on our side.
 * Buy Geeze a drink and he'll tell you where he found the rock samples.


 Airplane Aeriobatics:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  CONTROLS - Get in, Stick forward increases speed, Stick back decreases
   speed, Stick L/R makes quarter turns. Four quick flicks will do a
   one-eighty on a dime. Fire button: In air    - releases bug bomb.
                                                  (2 addtn'l ea. day)
                                      On ground - exits plane.

  ALTITUDE - Once in the air, Stick forward/backward controls speed and
   thus altitude... some rocks and fences are higher than others, a tough
   lesson to learn. Fuel is limited, but at the right speed you can 
   circumnavigate the entire map with a single tiger in your tank.
     Bear with me...

       1. The seperation of plane and its shadow is the only indication
          of altitude... till you hit something!
       2. IF, while in the air, AND flying at a right angle to screen,
          ( that's ORTHOGONAL in techie talk ), you can see any
          ground color between wing edge and shadow. Then you're flying
          TOO HIGH and TOO FAST, ie; wasting fuel.
       3. Slow down enough to make wing edge and shadow touch or overlap
          by one pixel and you'll clear everything on the ground, AND
          conserve fuel.

     You can land/takeoff and exit the airplane anywhere you can fly it,
   but, return to the airport or exchange winks with Nurse Judy.
     Desert landings are possible with heroic manuvering between the
   rocks and trees.

 SITUATION MAP NOTES - Get to Situation Map from Police Station.
                     - Townfolk will not defend airport.
                     - Tanks are avaliable where ever people are stationed.

                       will take VERY good care of you.


ANTS:
~~~~~

 ANTENNAS -  No hit = Lose round & fast trip to hospital.
              1 hit = Draw.
              2 hit = Win & Go to ground sequence.
                NOTE: A win in the Mine Tunnel just puts you above ground
                      back at the Ore Plant.
                TIPS: 1. If you didn't get 'em before head is off screen,
                         move gun extreme left at correct height and blaze
                         away.
                       
                      2. If you still didn't get 'em, move gun into position
                         before screen goes black. You'll have time for 3
                         fast shots in the close-up. You can get both
                         antennas if you're quick enough and still call it
                         a win.
    
                      3. Aim about half way up antenna, hits at base don't                         
                         work.
    
                      4. Shots from side are easier, Both antennas can be
                         clipped off with a single lucky shot.
    

 NEST     -  Located due South of Mine No.1, about one screen. That's off
             the main map, but you can fly over it or drive tank to it and
             even walk to it from Mine No.1.
          -  Entrance will remain open under certain circumstances could
             be when ants are running rampant or when temperature is above
             90deg. Either way it's not a good sign.

 WEATHER  -  Ants like mild weather. Count on them showing above ground if
             temperature is 70 - 80deg. and no rain or high winds. If temp.
             is higher or lower they can still be found in the mines.

 GROUND SEQUENCE - Direction(s) ants come from when attacking indicate
                   positions of map that have already overrun.
                 - Move as little as possiable, try to draw ants into a
                   column.
                 - Shots up/down screen are 1/3 longer that L/R.
                 - Learn to shoot on diagonals and you'll clean house!
                 - Beaware of barriers & escape routes, you can out run
                   'em but it takes a lot of room.
                 - Fences, rocks and other barriers are indestructable
                 - Buildings can be blown up.

 GENERAL ALERT   - Declared by the Mayor
                 - Command your own army from the situation map.
                 - Army: 99, Police: 40, Construction: 60, Townfolk: 80.
                 - Don't forget the Mine Tunnel, M1 & M2.
                 - Air Strike & Tanks become avaliable.


SAVE GAME:       - Save game to disk labeled -    DSAVE:
~~~~~~~~~~         NOTE: One game per disk, use several as the game can 
                         turn suddenly at any time.


HOSPITAL ANTICS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Before giveing it all away I need to say that the Hospital Escape segment
 is one of the cleverest and *FRUSTRATING* arcade bits I've ever experienced
 in a computer game. My hat is off to Cinemaware for dreaming up this little
 taste of insanity! Here is how it is done...


  Mistake No.1 - You've <IMPATIENTLY> selected 'Escape Hospital' as your next move. Forget it, your'bed & jabbed already! But you're gonna go anyway, because the alternative is watching your littl u tre at the ceiling all night, (REAL TIME!).


  Mistake No.2 - Yer watchin' the traffic. OK! Looks good! Pop the fire button and yer outta the sacey! what a cute little hospital johnny you're wearing!).

                               FAIR WARNING:
      You are now certified !RAW MEAT! for anything else that is moving!

  Whooops... Here comes a Candy Striper from off screen. Will she open my
door? [ Bubba. If she's on the same planet she's gonna open your door.] No
sweat, back to the bed, slap the button, and yer in and covered, chuckeling
up your non-existant sleeve while she checks your chart.
   Now she's gone, lets break for the hallway, Hmm, nice automatic doors in
this 50's hospital.

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]

  Jeasus! What is this!? Chariots of Fire? I'm tryin' to SNEAK outta this
place   an' I get a fanfair like it's the second comming! Oh well, at least
it's motivating. Lets go!

  OK, Swingin' down the hall, I'm goin' for the stairwell and elevator I
spotted last time. And this time I AM gonna make it! Around this next
corner and cut to the middle of this floor. Coast looks clear. Go for it!
  Damm! Here comes one of thoes green ball busters yellin' "There he is...
 Get 'em!". And to top it off he's between me and the elevator.
  Wait a sec', there's room right here and I'm right next to the door.
Shoot in and hide out till he passes, No, I tried that before and he just
waits at the door for me. Lets try jumpin' into bed with the blond. SHIT!
she's screamin' her ass off. OK, there's an empty right here, try that bed.
*click* and covered  . Hehee! He came in and didn't spot me. This is
p-r-r-r-e-t-t-y slick.
  Alright. Back out in the hall, elevators in range...
 "There he goes...", Loud mouth bitch! Didn't see her turn the corner... No
wait, here's an office, pop the door, it closes. Yeah but what if she comes
in!?  What's this... a desk? Lets see... *click* My ass hung out from under
that johnny I'm wearin', but I skinned right under that desk, (this place
is full of suprises),
 Yep, she checked out the room, but left anyway, YEAAAH! Got it knocked now
baby! Shoot for the moon! [ Ding! Ding! ], Elevator sweet elevator!
                                 Go-ing down...

  First floor you-are-soo-beautiful! Alright now, remember you can cut the
corners an' out run 'em on the diagonal. Just don't let 'em touch ya or get
right behind ya for too long. Missed me! Nanaah! Just as I thought there's
the front door... right between... those two guys... in the... grey
suits...
                                 !!! NUTS !!!
 Caught in a squeeze play by the two guerrillas watchin' the door. Aah,
well. Take me Nurse Judy, I'm just putty in your hands. But NEXT time I'm
takein' a ride on the green < WHEEL CHAIR > I glimpsed upstairs!


  Mistake No.3 - Back in the hospital again after a hard day down at the
ant farm. Call the Weather Station - "Warm tommorrow, high in the 70's"
Jeeeze! The whole country side will be crawling with ants... I gotta get
outa here...

                        *click* 'Escape Hospital'

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]

  Ooo-Kaay, Traffic is light and if I remember correctly that wheel chair
was right...  over... here... OH! NOO!! They moved it on me! Don't panic!
Keep it together now... if you can out run giant ants outside you sure as
hell can deal with this bunch of bozos in here. Lets try another corner...
Heaah! There it is! That nurse is gaining on me... better think fast. What
do I need to do to fire-up this chair. Watch out! Dodge right...
  Wheeeeee! Hey, all I needed to do was jump on the sucker. Eat my dust
turkeys! Got them clowns following me around like Key-Stone Cops. I can
even stop and wait for 'em to catch up... then peel rubber! Thoes goons
downstairs are gonna be a piece-o-cake this time!
  Alright, reality check here, obviously the stairs are out, an' I gotta be
sure somebody doesn't follow me into the elevator, so I'll get a big lead
and shoot the curl... [ Ding! Ding! ] Made it!

  First Floor: Socks, Lingerie aaand tickets home! Mama! Around the
corners, Whooup! Lets backtrack a little... Keep 'em streatched out and
wait for a break... Yeah! there it is! This Wheelin' Demon is headin' for
wide open road!
  Dodge left... right... one fer the grey monkey... two fer the grey
goon... Check it out! the front doors are o-p-e-n-i-n-g...

          *! BAM !* ...    What!!!? They got me!? I was half way out the
door, and they STILL got me! What is this Catch 22...? some kinda Monty
Python movie...? I think I want my ticket money back... Wait-a-minnit...
Just before the screen went black as Nurse Judy's soul, while the doors
were open there for a second... were thoes... did I see... < STEPS > right
outside the door? Sonafa-Gun! they were steps... O.K. I got your number
now... NEXT time I'm gonna JUMP OUTTA the wheel chair when the doors open
up!

  Mistake No.4 - Whew! I was ready for this trip in the meat wagon. Thoes
grenades will blow up ants and buildings, but wouldn't even touch that
stinkin' little piece of rail fence they had me up against. Gotta remember
to stay out of the corners. At least I've got the Hospital routine worked
out, I'm ready, I be bad! I'll be back on the streets in a flash!!!

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]

  A-Second Floor... it's al-right!
      A-Wheel Chair... it's awl-right!
          A-Elevator... it's awl-right!
               Shut 'em down,  Shut 'em down,  Baby gonna Shut 'em down!!

  Well Awl-Right! The slide for home base at the front doors realy did the
trick... Now I'm out and feelin' mean and rowdy. Lets check the time... Oh
no! it's after sundown! All that fancy foot work shot the rest of the day
right in the butt! Guess I might as well head on home and get a good nights
rest...   Hmmmmmm, I could have done that right here in the Hospital! With
Nurse Judy holding my hand allll night long!

   The dammable part of the Hospital Escape is that it is completely
unnecessary... But the challenge is irresistable.
   Fact is that if time is so critical that you must get out, then your
game is shot-to-hell anyway, But that's another mistake altogether!


                          -  PRODUCT DISCLAIMER  -

  The information contained in this Pre-walk thru is as accurate as I have
been able to determine WITH OUT COMPLETEING the game. Time acounting and 
sequences of events may very well be subject to some as yet undiscovered
factor(s?). Perhaps I should have titled this document: LETS PUT OUR HEADS
TOGETHER and SEE WHAT'S COOKIN' IN THE DESERT. But that was too long to
type!
 I know that you're playing DESERT also TimeX, and you to Doc Rock, (even
if you won't admit to it). So... if this stuff helps and you beat the game
before I do, feel free to use it as a starter and post your own walk-thru.

                 But I Bet You DON'T Finish Before I do!!!!!

  Let's start by  saying, that  even with this  solution you  may
find the  game very hard to solve. Because of the random monsters
that appear all  over the place  you will have  to enter the  inn
many times throughout the game. You also will find that you don't
have enough money to buy something needed, in this case just keep
walking  around until  you find  some monsters  to kill  for some
extra cash. I strongly suggest you  spend a good portion of  your
money on armor and weapons.

  Because Destiny is joystick controlled all the instructions  in
[]  are  the commands  or  directions on  the  right side  of the
screen,  the  instructions  in  the  ()  are  the  items  in your
possession or items on the screen and the instructions in the  ""
is what you have to type in yourself using your keyboard.

  Many times in the game you  will find you have too many  items,
at this point you will be asked to drop something, if you are not
sure  what to drop, try  dropping a piece of  armor or weapon and
then just buy a new one after  you have figured out what else  to
drop.  Some items are only used once and therefore can be dropped
right away some of  these items include  the "RUBBER GLOVES,  THE
ORC KEYS, ORC FOOD, THE POTION)...

In  two  scenes  (involving  the  'Thief'  and  the  'Deamon),  the  parser
occasionally  won't  recognize a command the first few times. This may have
been  corrected in later versions. Also, in the earlier version, you cannot
kill the Thief the first time so be sure to SAVE YOUR GAME!

DUNGEON MASTER - A COMPLETE SOLUTION

by Gordon Longley

MAGIC
To make creating and  casting  magic  in  a  hurry easier to remember,
number the symbols one to 6. So a  low power light spell becomes "1 4"
and a slightly higher power "2 4"  and so on. The following spells are
all written in their least  powerful  form.  A  character must have an
empty flask in either hand before creating a potion.

PRIEST SPELLS AND POTIONS
Potions
MA  - 1 1     - Stamina                 DANE - 1 1 5 3 - Wisdom
VI  - 1 2     - Health                  NETA - 1 1 5 4 - Vitality
YA  - 1 1 5   - Shield                  ROS  - 1 3 5 2 - Dexterity
BRO - 1 2 5   - Poison antidote         KU   - 1 4 5 1 - Strength
EE  - 1 6 5 5 - Mana

Spells
1 1 4 - Party shield    1 4 5 4 - Party fireshield

WIZARD SPELLS AND POTIONS
Potions
VEN - 1 6 1 - Poison. The flask is destroyed when you use this, so use
the Poison bolt spell instead.

Spells
1 4   - Light                           1 1 5 2 - Glowing footprints
1 6   - Open/Close doors                1 3 2 5 - see through walls
1 3 1 - Poison gas                      1 3 2 6 - Invisibility
1 4 4 - Fireball                        1 3 3 5 - lightning bolt
1 5 1 - Poison bolt                     1 3 4 5 - Long lasting light
1 5 2 - non-material beings             1 5 4 6 - Makes it dark again
(Does away with elementals)             1 6 3 5 - ZO KATH RA

NB: Poison Gas and  Poison  Bolt  spells  can  be fired through closed
gates. Poison gas is very effective  on  Rock  Monsters  - 5 3 1 turns
them to rubble - and is  also  useful against wasps. Multiple Strength
and Vitality potions are essential  for fighting Chaos Knights, though
other magic spells are useless. This is also true for the Stone Golems
on Level Seven.

USEFUL ITEMS
Delta = +1 to Mana
Diamond Edge
Dragon Spit = +7 to Mana
Inquisitor = +2 to Mana
Hard Cleave - you need to  have  attained  high fighter levels to make
the most of this.
Vorpal Blade = +4 to Mana. Use against non-material beings.
Teo Wand = +6 to Mana
Wand = +1 to Mana
Staff of Manar = +10 to Mana
Snake Staff = +8 to Mana
Moon Stone = +3 to Mana

LEVEL ONE - HALL OF CHAMPIONS
Select four characters from the mirrors.  WUUF's a good choice because
he carries a flask and you  can  start creating potions early. He also
learns the spells quite quickly and  has  good Health and Mana points.
GANDO and WU TSE are good too.
        Don't  be  too  passive  -  you  can  start  to  develop  your
characters' attributes as soon as you resurrect them. Get them to cast
simple spells - Light, Health or  Stamina  - while you search for your
next character and their mana  soons  starts to recover. Initiallty, a
character's Mana level  recovers  by  one  point  at  a  time until it
reaches 40, when the rate doubles.  By  the time your characters' Mana
gets to 80 it recovers at three times the original rate, so it's worth
using any object which enables Mana to be recovered more quickly.
        Try making priests  learn  wizard  spells,  and  wizards learn
priest spells - they're not  very  successful  at  first, but they can
gain a character level before you enter  the next part of the dungeon.
You must also keep practising spells - the first fireball you throw at
a monster is unlikely to work, so  be  prepared to fight your way out.
You can also try throwing weapons through gates to avoid close combat.
Be sure to master the Poison  Gas  spell  early  since you need it for
Level Three.
        Always  wear  the   best   clothing/armour   when  it  becomes
available. If you get  lost  use  the  scrolls, discarded clothing and
other junk to mark the passageways  you've completed. It can be useful
to mark your route, so you can avoid being trapped down a cul-de-sac.

LEVEL TWO
There's a gold key lying  on  the  floor  which opens the locked gate.
Next you find a Topaz key. Now  operate  the levers to open a gate and
close the pit. You find a gold key.  Go back to the two gates and find
the emerald key. Go through the  room  with two pressure pads avoiding
the second to get past the gate. Find  the solid and iron keys go back
across the pressure pads. Use the keys on the doors to your right.
        The plain wooden door can opened  by  using the gold key which
lies nearby. Alternatively, you can hack down  the door if one of your
characters has a Chop option and  save  the  key for Level Three. This
door leads to a large room  with  nine  pressure pads on the floor and
two gates at the other end. Walk up  to the first gate which closes as
you get to it. Step back  one  pace,  then walk forwards to the second
gate, back one step and through. You  can find another gold key at the
far end of the next room.

Step inside take a ride
Enter the transporter to find another  gold  key.  Put a rock onto the
pressure pad to close the pit, walk past the next gate and you come to
a gate with a monster. There's  an  iron  key behind you for this gate
and a key of B inside for the previous gate. Enter a large room with a
button on the wall and a pressure  pad. The button opens your exit and
the pad  closes  it  again.  Pull  the  levers  at  the  end  of  both
passageways to open the gate  opposite,  take the right passage first.
"To close pit, drop valuable" - transport any object across the pit to
close it, and find the gold key.  Now  pick  up the copper coin in the
next room.

None shall pass
There's a blue curtain round the corner, beyond that a chest which you
can't reach. Simply chop the plain wooden door to get the chest.

This fountain accepts one wish
Use the copper coin to open  the  door.  Ignore the gate to your left,
but take the next left turn  and  pull  the  lever. Now go back to the
gate, pull the lever inside and go  back  to the first lever to find a
secret room. The next gate you come  to  leads to the stairs and Level
Three.

LEVEL THREE
Walk eight paces down the  corridor.  On  the  left wall is a pressure
switch which reveals a secret passage.  Walk  up to the curtain at the
end of this passage and quickly take  two paces forward when it fades,
collect the compass and other items, then  step into the curtain to be
transported back up the passage.
        Keep walking down the  main  passage  until  you  come to some
gates which lead to Level Four,  but  first  find the gold keys to get
through. It's worth leaving any  heavy  items  - chests, for example -
here. Now go back to the turn-off you passed earlier.

Choose your door, choose your fate
The passage opens up to a large  square with six doors leading off it.
Each door leads to a gold key -  the  chest you find is useful for The
Vault room. When you've got three  keys  it's worth going back to open
the first gates because you  find  useful  objects  and some more food
there. The RA key opens a door on Level Seven.

The Matrix
This is the easiest place to  start.  Walk  down the passage until you
come to  a  room  with  many  junctions.  Some  of  these  rotate your
orientation, so a compass proves useful.  Walk  into the room and turn
left, walk four paces forward past  the  arrow, now walk into the wall
and there's a secret space.  Go  in,  turn  right  round and walk back
eight paces, turn left and  walk  six  paces.  Turn left and walk four
paces. Step right and  press  the  switch.  Step  left  and walk three
paces. Step right and forward one to find the key.

Time is of the essence
"Hit and Run." If you have difficulty here drop any heavy items so you
can move more quickly, or use  Strength potions. Press the blue button
and quickly take four steps to the  left and two steps forwards. Press
the next blue button, turn left  and  throw an object into the curtain
to transport it on to the pressure  pad  which closes the pit. For the
next pit press  the  button  and  quickly  step  backwards  two paces.
There's another button round the  corner  to  close  this pit for your
return.

Chamber of the Guardian
Be careful the guardian doesn't  get  behind  you and block your exit.
There are seven gates with a  chest  behind one of them. Keep pressing
the button to the left  of  the  chest  until  it's transported to the
bottom of the passage. Half way  along this passage opposite the gates
is a small blue eye - use the Mirror of Dawn from the chest on this to
reveal a short passageway.

Room of the Gem
"Step right up, going down."  Drop  an  object  on the pressure pad to
close the pit. When you press  the  blue  button  on the other side to
open the door the object is transported across as well casuing the pit
to reopen, so toss it back again.  There's  a switch at the end of one
of the passageways which opens a wall to reveal the blue gem. Use this
to open the door near the entrance.

The Vault
"You must pay for your  entrance."  Use  the  two  gold coins from the
chest to open the inner door. When  you see "Cast your influence, cast
your might" - cast ZO spell 1 6  to open the door beyond the pit, then
throw an item onto the pressure pad.  Replace the silver coin with any
object to keep the next door open, then  use the coin to open the door
after that. Finally use one  copper  coin  from  the chest you find to
open the wall to your right and look  for a small button which opens a
secret room.

Creature Cavern
Try to lure all the monsters to the  gate and use Poison Gas or Poison
Bolt spells. Don't leave the gate open or the monsters get everywhere.

Before you leave the level use  a  gold  key  to open the wooden door.
Inside is a small button to open  a  short passage two paces back. You
may find it helpful to use spell  1 3 2 5 to see what's behind first.

LEVEL FOUR
"Prepare to meet your  doom."  If  you're  not  already doing so, it's
worth having Health potions prepared in advance. Use the most powerful
you can create. The poison antidote should also be kept in readiness.
        "Don't let a closed door stop you,  " so chop it down. Further
on is a pressure button on the  floor  which opens the gate ahead when
you trigger it. Turn left  and  press  the  button  on  the wall to be
transported to the gate, then quickly  step  two paces right. now turn
round and pull the lever to  open  the  gate  again. Turn left. On the
wall in front of you is a cup  with slime oozing out, click here for a
gold key.
        When you get to the next wooden door turn round and go back up
the passage. Keep walking in a straight  line until you reach the wall
opposite, step left and walk into the  wall.  Now go back to the door.
Past the next door is a coin slot. This switches on a blue curtain.
        "Short cut." Use  a  gold  key  to  switch  on the transporter
curtain. From "short-cut back" go  through  two  more wooden doors and
walk into the wall opposite the door, then turn to your right for some
hidden objects.
        When you come  to  a  room  full  of  tree-like  monsters, use
magicdefensively -  Magic  Party  Protection,  Strength  and  Vitality
potions - and fight them to boost  your fighter and priest levels. The
tree-monsters are also going to be your major food supply from now on.
With your back to the gate  step  left  and  walk three paces into the
wall ahead for some more hidden items.
        "This is my prisoner, let  him  suffer."  Kill him to open the
gate to Level Five.  This  also  releases  some  worms  -  quite a lot
actually - so it's worth exploring ahead before you do.

LEVEL FIVE
Walk five paces and climb the  stairs  on  your left. Press the button
for a short cut back to Level Four.

Treasure stores
        Square room with four doors leading off. Turn right. The first
door leads to a room full of  blue transporter curtains. Step into the
room, then step right, back, forwards, left, right and back.
        Second Door When you're half  way  down  the passage turn left
and you come to a room. Press the button and two walls move, revealing
two more buttons. From the  end  of  the  passage walk straight to the
opposite wall, turn right and press the button, step three paces right
and one pace forward Press the  button,  step right, turn right round,
walk to the opposite wall and press the next button. Provided you have
ignored the other buttons take onestep  back  and three paces right to
find a secret room.
        Third Door. When you come to a room turn right and walk to the
wall, turn right and press the button.  Now walk back past the passage
you started from and round  the  edge  of  the  room until you come to
another passage. As you search the passages you step on a pressure pad
which opens a secret passage for your return.
        Fourth Door. You enter  a  large  room  with  26 pressure pads
which open pits as you try to  cross  the room, Some pads open several
pits all round you while others  may  toggle one specific pit open and
closed. I crossed using Z, W, X, Y, X, Y, T, O, J and E but was forced
to use a slightly different route when I attempted to repeat it.

--------------------
---A  B  C  D  E----
   F  G  H  I  K
   K  L  M  N  O
   P  Q  R  S  T
   U  V  W  X  Y
---------Z----------

Try to reach the right exit first. If your way is blocked, look to see
if you can return to  the  place  you  were  forced to step back from,
since this may close the offending pits.  If  you fail, try to reach C
because this toggles the pit at  A.with A closed try to reach the left
exit in a similar manner.
        From the left exit turn left.  Three  paces down on your right
you find manacles on the wall. Walk  into  the wall here, to your left
is a water fountain. Turn to your right  and step left into it - leave
an object on the floor to mark  your  exits. Go back past the pit room
and you come to stairs leading down. Look  on the wall to the right of
the stairs for another button, this  opens  the  wall at the bottom of
the short passage to your  right.  -  on  this  is a short-cut through
Level Six, but don't take it yet.
        Go down the stairs and press the  button on the wall to reveal
a large room under the pits. From the start of this room turn left and
walk two paces and enter  the  wall  here. The blue curtain transports
you back to Z in the pit room.

LEVEL SIX
You now come to the Riddle Room. There are 4 alcoves here, each with a
riddle inscribed nearby. You need  three  items  to open the gate, the
fourth riddle reveals a key.

I am all, I am non = Mirror of Dawn.
Hard as rock, blue as sky, twinkle in woman's eye = blue gem.
I arch yet have no back = bow
A golden head and tail but no body = gold coin

You enter a room with a pit  and  a gate which shuts when you approach
it - NB: the chamber under  the  pit  room  it a useful short-cut back
through this level, see later.(*). Go to the lever and place an object
on the floor behind you - the gate now opens when you pull the lever.

"The grave of King Filius, explorer of combinations."
There are four buttons around the room, only two are needed. Go to the
inscription. Step right two paces, forward one and press the button on
your left. Turn left, walk three paces, turn left again, step forwards
one, press button on  your  left.  You're  now  in  the  grave of King
Milias. Place a gold coin  in  the  tiny  hole.  "If  you want to stay
alive, you'd better turn and  run"  Take  the  right passage. "I don't
like to be ignored." Walk to the bottom, step right two paces, walk to
the bottom. There's a button on the  left wall which opens the wall in
the far corner behind you. When you find  it look on the left wall for
another button which opens the wall  near the previous button. There's
a button on the floor in this room which opens a wall when you step on
it - get the skeletons to stand on  this to enter the space behind - a
Magic Box is useful here.
        Left passage "I hate cowards". After  the  next door is a door
to your left, on your right there  is  a metal ring fixed to the wall,
click this to reveal a secret  passage  opposite  the door. Look for a
button three paces from  the  end  of  the  passage for another secret
passage. When you go through the  next  door it slams shut behind you.
There's a pressure pad past  the  door  in  front  which opens it, but
first you need the key. To your right is a blue curtain which prevents
you reaching the gate beyond it.  Cast  a  strong ZO spell to open the
gate, drop any heavy items and armour  so you can move quickly. Timing
and speed are important here,  two  steps  gets past the first curtain
then take another two steps to get  past  the second. You find a solid
key inside.
        "Test your strength." Throw a sword or dagger to open the gate
at the other end. Anything else just  hits  the back of your head. Now
go down the right passage. At the  next  junction look for a button on
the wall, this reveals the  other  stairs  from  Level Five. There's a
room further on with a transporter curtain  which makes up more of the
short-cut through this level. The transporter takes you to a room with
a door leading off. The lever  up  the passageway opens this door, but
pressures pads on both sides cause it  to close again when either you,
or monsters step on them, so it  can  take a number of attempts to get
in and out again. The last room before the stairs to Level Seven has a
pit in it, look down there for  a Magic Box. The transporter takes you
right back near the start (*).

LEVEL SEVEN
The Tomb of the Firestaff: use  the  RA  key  "The keys to passage lie
hidden deep." The RA keys are on  Level Nine and 12, you must retrieve
them before you go any further  on  this  level. Go on to Level Eight.
Return with the RA keys and go  through  the next two doors. The Stone
Golems on this level take some  beating  -  fireballs are useless - so
use priest skills to create  lots  of Strength, Vitality and Dexterity
potions. Give the potions  to  two  of  your  characters, who cant hen
fight them while using  Magic  Party  Protection.  Make  sure you have
plenty of Health potions prepared too.  There are four doors along the
right wall - you can open one of these with the turquoise key you find
later.

Door One - Gem of Ages, Sceptre of Life, Illumley.
Door Two - Dragon Spit, Boots of Speed.
Door Three - Crown of Nerra, Magic Box.
Door Four - Flamebain, Bolt Blade.

"Danger enter with caution." Use the  Ruby  key  from Level 11 to open
this door. In  the  room  at  the  end  of  the  passage  you find the
Turquoise key under some  ashes.  Step  left  and  press the button, a
short passage opens to your left  where  you  find  a RA key. When you
leave this room take four  paces  along  the  right wall and press the
button to  reveal  a  long  passage  further  on.  when  this  passage
straightens out, walk seven paces forward to find a button on the left
wall which reveals the Winged  key  at  the  end of the passage behind
you. The other end of this passage  leads  to stairs down to Level 13.
Take the stone club dropped by the  Golem,  go down and open the wall,
drop the club here to mark the passage then return up the stairs.
        Use the RA key near the  "danger  enter with caution" door. At
the end of the passage go left or right - they both end up at the same
place - and the next junction  you  come  to  is  the end of the other
passage. Go down both passages here and kill the Stone Golems guarding
the Firestaf - you need the  Master  key  from  the end of Level 12 to
collect it.

LEVEL EIGHT
This is a large open area with numerous pits, fireball-spewing cannons
and blue curtains. The curtains rotate  the fireballs sending them all
around the level. If you fall down one of the pits, explore it to find
many useful items. From the  stairs  turn  left, dodging the fireballs
and turn left when you come to the  wall.  You find a chest at the end
of a short passage - don't hang around or you get hit by the fireballs
from the cannons. Look to the  left  of the blue curtain, opposite the
cannons, for a button which reveals a space containing a green button.
Use the green button to turn off the curtain.
        There are five more  buttons  to  find  around the walls which
reveal secret areas. One of these has  a very long passage - there's a
transporter which sends you back  to  the  start,  making it seem even
longer - walk 26 paces and wait,  the wall behind you opens. The short
passage with a door is your way to  Level Nine. You need the solid key
which can be found on the floor directly opposite the cannons and past
the jutting wall. Near  the  stairs  is  a  skull  on  a wall. Use the
skeleton key from the chest to open up the master stairway to Level 14
and the Winged key from Level Seven at the bottom.
        You can access the stairway via  a skeleton key on each level.
Unfortunately, there aren't enough keys  to  open each level, so leave
out Level Ten, otherwise the monsters keep bugging you.

LEVEL NINE
"When is rock not rock" Step left and walk through the wall - mark the
other side in case you want to return. There's a button in the room to
the left which reveals a  secret  area.  Cast the marks your footprint
spell to help you with the passage to your right. After the next door,
look for a button near the  left  far  corner. Ignore the next door on
your left and you come to a gate  with  a chest on the other side. The
lever opens a pit, close the  pit  again  then go back to the previous
door and down the stairs to retrieve the chest.
        There are stairs leading up at the end of one of the passages.
Look in the room above for a  button. Drop any shields and swords down
the pit as they're  useful  for  solving  the  next  puzzle. Drop down
through the pit and you're on the outside of the gate.
        "What is under foot is soon  over  head." The pressure pads on
the floor cause fireballs to  be  fired  from  the wall ahead. Drop an
item on each pad, then avoid  the  fireball. You can now cross without
triggering more fireballs.
        Down the left passage is a  button which reveals a secret room
at the end. The right  route  leads  to  the  "lighter than a feather"
gate. Place Corbanite in  the  alcove  to  open  this. You should have
found an open gate near here, close it. The room beyond is useful as a
feeding station but unlike  Level  Four,  these  monsters  are hard to
kill.

LEVEL TEN
"Beware my  twisted  humour,  the  deceiver,  the  snake."  Try  to go
straight ahead and you're transported  back  to  the stairs. Go to the
far left and forwards,  then  far  right  and  forwards,  far left and
forwards.
        There are two wooden doors and  a  key of B lying nearby. Both
routes end up at the same place. Inside both sides one of the monsters
has the key of B which opens your  exit. You can use this on the other
door instead so completing both sides.
"Zooooom." This sends you round in  a  circle and needs careful timing
to get off at the right place. The blue curtain transports you back to
the stairs.
        Gate with a "+" shape button  on  the wall - inside here there
are loads of monsters, but they're  unable  to move very far. When you
leave, the button or pressure  pad  releases  them. From the gate walk
five paces forward and look on the right  for a button to open a space
in the corner. Follow the passage round  until you come to door on the
left. This room is a useful resting  place.  Look for a button to open
the wall  in  here  -  you  can  transport  back  to  this  room later
($).Outside the door the passage opens up to a small room. Look in the
left corner for a button, turn right and walk to the wall, step right,
forward one pace and right  two  for  another  button to open the wall
back where the other button was. Walk  into the wall there for another
item. There are two open gates  close  together which lead to the same
place. Further on  are  two  more  open  gates  spaced  further apart.
Outside the left gate, press the  button  in  the alcove on the right,
now look inside for another button to open the wall round the corner.
        There is a room off the  passageway  with a '+' shape button -
press this to transport between the room mentioned earlier ($).

LEVEL 11
Go down the stairs  and  you  find  yourself  in  square passage which
doubles back on itself. In fact,  there  are  four of these and you're
transported between them as you walk round. On one of the walls is the
inscription  "Turn  back."  In  the   corner  opposite  is  the  first
transporter which is activated when you turn right to face the stairs.
        From the stairs walk to the opposite corner, turn right twice,
then turn left to find an iron  key  in  front of you. Now turn right,
walk forwards and you  come  to  another inscription "clockwise." Turn
right and walk one  pace  forward,  turn  right  round  to see a brown
keyhole in the wall, use the iron key  to open the gate. Open the wall
behind the gate. Inside the chest is  a solid key. Go back through the
gate turn left and walk to  the  wall,  turn right, one pace forwards,
turn round and walk anti-clockwise until  you  come to a gold keyhole,
use the solid key  to  open  the  wall.  Now  walk  clockwise from the
keyhole, take one pace round the third  corner and turn right round to
see "turn back" in the very first passage.
        At the end of the passage to the right is a sword. Don't panic
when you pick it up, stay where you are. When the gas clears leave the
room one step at a  time.  Search  the  the  passages until you hear a
click. Go back and look for a button which opens the wall, revealing a
skeleton key.
        Three Doors and a cross  key  on  the  floor.  Pick one of the
doors and look forthe two copper coins  inside. The centre door is the
shortest route. When you emerge from the exit, the two doors you can't
open are the exits for the other  routes. Go through the next door and
search for a button at the end of the passage to reveal some armour.
        "Enlarge my view." Use  the  magnifier  to  reveal a Ruby key.
Outside the door from here  step  right  two  paces  and walk into the
wall. Step right and forwards, now turn right.
        Past the stairs is a room  full  of  coin slots for the copper
coins you found earlier. Working  anti-clockwise these reveal: a green
Magic Box, a chest of food, a Cross key  - so you can go back and find
more coins - two copper coins,  another  green  Magic Box, a FUL Bomb,
another FUL Bomb and a final green Magic Box.

LEVEL 12
At the end of the  passage  from  the  stairs  is a pressure pad, this
opens and closes a line of pits in the room ahead when you step on it.
Step into the room then  back  to  close  the pits. There are passages
from here leading left and  right.  From  the  left passage is a large
room with a door in the  centre,  rather  like  an island. Inside is a
Topaz key.
        From the right passage, go past a gate. On the left is a small
room. Enter it and you  find  a  letterbox-shape  button on you left.,
press this to open the island room. First look round the wall opposite
the entrance for a small button.  Use  the  Topaz  key on the gate you
past earlier - kill what's  inside  to  get  the  Emerald key. Use the
Emerald key on the gate at  the  end  of  the passage. In an alcove on
your left you find the RA key. Now go back to Level Seven. In the next
room from where you found the RA key is a big green button, this opens
a door at the end of a passage on the other side of the level.
        When you return, do the  left  side  first.  From the big room
there's a passage with a door  and  a  gate  on the right, look on the
opposite wall for a  button  to  open  the  wall  just after the door.
Search all the passages. At  the  end  of  one  passage  is a door. Go
through and down the passage to the  left  .Stand near the end of this
passage for a moment and the  wall  opens.  The last door from here is
opened with the green button. Fight  your  way through the passages on
the right.
        "Cowards will be hunted down  and  killed." There's a pressure
pad here which opens all three doors when you step of it.
        Rotating pits stand on the left of the room. Run forwards when
the pit moves away from you. Fnd the Master key. Go down the stairs to
the right and you see  the  stone  club  marking  the stairway back to
Level Seven. Use the Master key to unlock the Firestaff.

LEVEL 13
This is the final level, so do  level  14 first. The Dark Lord resides
in the main chamber, but you're  safe enough in the outer passageways.
The chamber is divided in two by  lines  of fire elementals and one of
the pits - if you get into serious  trouble you can escape to Level 14
by dropping down a pit. Use  the  Party shield and Fire shield spells,
then beat down the fire elementals with the Vorpal blades and kill all
the demons. Many attempts at  this  are  needed as the fire elementals
reform whenever  Lord  Chaos  appears.  Finally,  trap  Chaos  in  the
fluxcage and fuse him with the Firestaff.

LEVEL 14
Use the Winged key to open a passage. At the end of this is a lever to
open the wall to the dragon's lair.  Be  careful. Use the Horn of Fear
in combination with Brandish  from  the  Snake  Staff  to frighten the
beast, you can now chase the monster round the chamber.
        Under a pile of ashes close  to  where  you came in you find a
square key, use this to open the door to the left. Cast the ZO KATH RA
spell to release the power gem and  click on it with the Firestaff. If
you walk outside this room  holding  the  Firestaff  and Power Gem the
main stairway seals, trapping you in  the  lowest levels - the dungeon
doesn't like you taking it  passed  Level  13  and  tries to stop you.
Instead toss the Firestaff  through  the  doorway.  The  stairs at the
other end of this chamber lead up to Level 13.

   2 ... Dolphin
   3 ... Cruise ship and Kelp Maze
   4 ... Eluria Under the Sea
   5 ... Eluria and the Fish Aparments
   6 ... Ocean Reef

1. Research Center

Problem:
Hints on Hints!

Hint:
There are many  hints included in this game.  Be sure to use the  look and talk
cursors on everything.  Often when you're stuck, Delphineus,  the dolphin, will
give you some  helpful suggestions. Or talk to many  of the other characters in
the game because they'll also give you helpful clues.

Problem:
How do I save the oily bird?

Hint:
Use  the eye  or hand  cursor on  the bird  to get  a close-up view. Beside the
bird's box, you'll notice a bottle of mild detergent and a soft, clean rag. Use
the hand cursor to pick these items  up. Open your inventory screen, select the
detergent and click it  on the rag. This will put soap  on the rag. Select this
soapy rag from inventory and use it to clean the bird.

Problem:
How do I put detergent on the rag?

Hint:
First open the inventory  icon from the Icon Bar. You should  see the bottle of
mild detergent and the soft, clean rag.  If they aren't in your inventory, then
you need to pick them up from beside  the bird's box in the center of the room.
Just use the hand  cursor to pick them up. With these  items in your inventory,
first select the detergent  and click it on the rag. This  will put soap on the
rag. Select the soapy rag from inventory and use the rag cursor on the bird.

Problem:
Where is the water for the gerbil?

Hint:
You can find  the gerbil's water bottle on  the table just to the  right of his
cage. Use the hand cursor to pick  up the bottle. Next, select the water bottle
from your inventory and use it on the gerbil's cage.

Problem:
What do I do with the aquarium full of oily water?

Hint:
For the aquarium, do you remember the flask of experimental fertilizer solution
Adam's Dad gave you? You can use  this solution on the aquarium. It will create
bacteria to eat the  oil. Don't worry, Adam won't use all  this solution on the
aquarium. So there will be plenty left over to use later in the game.

Problem:
What's the  article on the  computer about? How  about the illustration  on the
blackboard?

Hint:
Both the article  and the illustration give you  a clue for a major  event that
will take place later in the game. Use the eye cursor on the blackboard to look
at the  buoy, the cable,  and the  transmitter.  These items combine  to make a
satellite buoy. You will have the opportunity to create your own satellite buoy
to remove some  toxic waste barrels from the ocean.  Therefore, be sure to look
for these items on your journey through the game.

Problem:
What do I do with the envelope?

Hint:
Why not open it?  Use the hand cursor on it to remove  the contents. If you use
the hand cursor on it a second time, Adam will throw away the empty envelope.

Problem:
What are all of the items that I need from the Research Center?

Hint:
You need two  items, the experimental fertilizer solution  from Adam's Dad, and
Adam's reusable garbage bag. With these  two items in your inventory, you'll be
ready to continue your journey outside the Research Center.

Problem:
How do I get out of the Research Lab?

Hint:
You can't go out the door Adam's Dad  went out. Instead, use the hand cursor on
the door just  to the left of the  blackboard. You can find the  combination to
the door lock in your game documentation.

Problem:
I can't unlock the door to leave the Research Center!

Hint:
You can find the combination to the lock in your game documentation.

2. Dolphin

Problem:
How do I make friends with the dolphin?

Hint:
When you enter  this room, take a look at  the blackboard. The blackboard lists
step-by-step instructions  on what to do  with the dolphin. Your  first step to
becoming his friend is to talk with  him three times. Did you notice him eyeing
the bucket of fish? Your second step to  becoming his friend is to feed him two
fish. There's a  bucket full of mackerel beside the  door you came through. The
third step is to  go swimming with him. Use the hand  cursor on the pool ladder
to join him in the tank.

Problem:
The dolphin wants to give me a ride on his fin. How can I?

Hint:
Use the hand cursor on his fin. He'll take you for a ride around the pool.

Problem:
I'm done swimming with the dolphin. What do I do next?

Hint:
Look for a toy he might like to play with. Take the frisbee. It's on top of the
cabinet just  underneath the blackboard. Then  use the frisbee on  the dolphin.
He'll love playing catch with you!

Problem:
How can I help Delphineus?

Hint:
You want to let him out of the  tank. The lever to open the underwater hatch is
located  just to  the right  of the  gate that  divides the  tank. Use the hand
cursor on the lever to open it.

Problem:
Delphineus has returned to the Research Lab dock. How can I join him?

Hint:
You need to  get your diving gear. Your  diving gear is located in  the cabinet
just  underneath the  blackboard. Then,  you can  select your  diving gear from
inventory and use the  diving gear cursor on Adam, or you  can simply walk east
off  the pier.  Either way,  Adam will  put his  gear on  and jump right in the
water!

Problem:
Where do I go after I leave the Research Center Lab?

Hint:
When  you leave  the Research  Center, swim  directly north.  Eventually you'll
encounter a cruise ship dumping garbage into the water.

3. Cruise Ship & Kelp Maze

Problem:
What do I do when I see the cruise ship dumping garbage?

Hint:
You can use a reusable garbage bag to  clear a path in the trail of garbage. To
do  this, remove  two items--  one from  the front  of the  garbage and another
directly behind it. Now Adam and Delphineus can swim through.

Problem:
I don't have a reusable garbage bag!

Hint:
You need  to swim back  to the Research  Center and get  it. You'll find  it in
front of the recycle bin beside the computer back in the lab.

Problem:
What do I do with this glass jar I found?

Hint:
Why not save it  for later? A container like this will  certainly come in handy
later--that is, if you can get the lid off.

Problem:
What can I do about the balloons that the little boy let go?

Hint:
There isn't much  you can do about these  now. Later in the game  you'll have a
chance to deal with the balloons.

Problem:
I need some help finding my way through the seaweed and kelp maze!

Hint:
Before you enter  the seaweed and kelp maze,  save your game. You need  to take
three turns  to get through the  maze successfully. In the  first screen of the
maze, swim  south through the  dark blue opening  in the bottom  center of your
screen. In  the second screen of  the maze, swim through  the bottom right-hand
corner of your screen. In the third screen of the maze, swim through the bottom
left-hand corner of your screen. You should  now see Eluria, the city under the
sea.

Problem:
Is it possible to get extra points with the reusable garbage bag?

Hint:
Pick up as much garbage as you can find. Therefore, when you find an area where
garbage has fallen,  remove all of it to  get extra points. You can  pick up as
many as ten extra points per area!

4. Eluria Under the Sea

Problem:
Where is the Oracle?

Hint:
Look for her in the Temple of Poseidon. She lives behind the marble wall at the
back of the Temple covered with symbols, figures, and strange letters.

Problem:
How do I open the marble wall?

Hint:
Use Poseidon's  Trident on the  three large eyes  dominating the center  of the
marble wall.

Problem:
How do I obtain Poseidon's trident?

Hint:
You can use  the bronze conch shell to get  Poseidon's trident. Place the conch
shell  in the  hands of  Poseidon's  servant  on the  statue in  the Courtyard.
Poseidon will loosen his grip on the trident and you'll be able to take it.

Problem:
How do I solve the mixed-up mosaic tile puzzle?

Hint:
The object of this puzzle is to slide the tiles one at a time to form a picture
of a  man, a fish, a  dog, and a heart.  If you get stuck,  simply use the hand
cursor on the help  button just below the picture. This will  cause one tile to
slide toward its correct position. Clicking  the hand cursor on the help button
repeatedly will eventually solve the puzzle.

Problem:
What  is  the  solution  to  the  Oracle's  riddle  that begins "Whose march of
progress dooms us all"?

Hint:
The answer  is man. Therefore,  to answer this  riddle correctly, use  the hand
cursor on the drawing of the man in the picture.

Problem:
What is  the solution to  the Oracle's riddle  that begins "What  glides like a
bird but does not fly"?

Hint:
The answer  is fish. Therefore, to  answer this riddle correctly,  use the hand
cursor on the drawing of the fish in the picture.

Problem:
What is  the solution to the  Oracle's riddle that begins  "What reaches out to
those in need"?

Hint:
The answer  is love. Therefore,  to answer the  riddle correctly, use  the hand
cursor on the  drawing of the heart in  the picture. You have now  answered her
riddles correctly.

Problem:
Should I take the bicycle basket from the Elurian Courtyard?

Hint:
Yes, pick it up. The basket will come in very handy later.

Problem:
Where might I find the Guardian of the Greens?

Hint:
You'll find  the Guardian of the  Greens hiding in the  Royal Gardens. Go there
and use the  experimental fertilizer solution from Adam's Dad  on the statue of
the whale. When she comes out, be sure to talk to her.

Problem:
Where can I find the Mayor?

Hint:
You'll find  the Mayor hiding  in the  Council  Chambers. To get  him to appear
before you, solve the challenge of the columns.

Problem:
The challenge of the columns has me stumped!

Hint:
Each of the three columns on the left has three sections that spin when you use
the hand cursor on them. Your goal is to make these nine sections match up with
their counterparts on the columns to the  right. You'll notice as you spin each
section of the  columns, all but one section turns  a second section of another
column. However, one  of these sections will turn by  itself. Find this section
and continue to spin it until you  get the message "the column piece locks into
place." Continue this same procedure for the other eight sections. For example,
start  with the  top section  of the  front-most column.  If you notice another
column also  turning when you  spin this section,  skip to the  next section of
this column. If it spins another column piece, move to the next section, and so
on, moving  from section to  section, then column  to column, until  you find a
section that turns  by itself. Once you've found this  section, keep turning it
until it locks in place. Now repeat this procedure for the rest of the columns.

Problem:
How can I gain the trust of Superfluous?

Hint:
Have you visited the Guardian of  the Greens in the Royal Gardens? Superfluous'
problem is that his shell is too tight. After using the experimental fertilizer
solution from Adam's Dad on the statue  of the whale in the Royal Gardens, talk
to her. Then you'll find a shell on the garden floor. After cleaning this shell
with a rag, talk to Superfluous to get him to come out and give him the shell.

Problem:
I can't find a rag to clean the shell!

Hint:
You can find a clean rag in front of the fish apartments.

5. Eluria & The Fish Apartments

Problem:
I need a pass for the fish apartments.

Hint:
You can  get a pass  from the Mayor,  Superfluous, by giving  him the shell you
found on the floor of the Royal Gardens after cleaning the whale statue.

Problem:
How can I help Narcissus, the Blowfish?

Hint:
Use the hand cursor  on Narcissus to push him into his  apartment. Use the hand
cursor on him again to remove the plastic bag.

Problem:
How do I find food for Epidermis, the Angelfish?

Hint:
Use the algae-eating sea urchins Narcissus gave you on the plants in Epidermis'
room. Now Epidermis will have plenty to eat.

Problem:
How can I help Hippocrates, the Swordfish?

Hint:
Use the very sharp shell that Epidermis,  the Angelfish, gave you to remove the
six-pack rings from Hippocrates' snout.

Problem:
How can I help Erroneous, the Sea Turtle?

Hint:
Use the  tweezers you received  from Hippocrates, the  swordfish, on Erroneous'
mouth to remove  the balloons. You will need  to use the tweezers twice  to get
all of the pieces out.

Problem:
How do I help Gregarious, the Manatee?

Hint:
Did you notice how the boat propellers on the boats back at the Research Center
were covered with  baskets? To help Gregarious, you need  to attach the bicycle
basket you found in the courtyard  over the propellers of the fisherman's boat.
To  do this,  first attach  the four  screws you  got from  Erroneous, the  Sea
Turtle, to the  basket. Talk to the fisherman, then  secure the basket over his
boat's propellers.

Problem:
How can I help Olympia, the Lionfish?

Hint:
To help Olympia,  you need the water pump that  fell from the fisherman's boat.
You'll find it  lying on the ocean floor  in front of the fish  apartments. Use
Adam's reusable trash  bag on the bottle of  bleach to throw it away.  Then use
the water pump in her window to clear the water of the bleach.

Problem:
What is the "Sign of Trust" that the Oracle wants?

Hint:
Give  her the  gold mask  Superfluous gave  you after  the Council meeting. Now
she'll trust you and give you her prophecy.

6. Ocean Reef

Problem:
What should I do with the glowing ear of the Colossus Head?

Hint:
There's a flashlight fish  in the ear of the Colossus Head.  You need to rescue
the flashlight fish from the ear, using an  empty jar. If you didn't find a jar
in the trash spilling from the cruise ship earlier in the game, you'll find one
on the reef ledge right in front of the Colossus Head.

Problem:
How do I remove the lid from the jar?

Hint:
Did  you see  the octopus  one screen  to the  left of  the sunken  submersible
vehicle? He's  hiding in some rocks  there that he's turned  into his lair. Set
the jar on the  sand in front of his lair or use  the jar cursor on the octopus
and then hide in the large sponges. He'll open the jar for you.

Problem:
The octopus won't let me have the silver cable!

Hint:
Did you pick up  the mirror from the reef ledge in  front of the Colossus Head?
Show this mirror to the octopus and you'll  scare him away. Now you can get the
cable.

Problem:
What should I do with this pirate skeleton?

Hint:
Grab onto the Conquistador's Pike that has pinned the skeleton to the rocks! On
your first  attempt, you will  fall into the  water, but the  Pike will give  a
little. Grab onto the  Pike a second time. It will come  loose and the gold key
will dislodge from the bank and fall into the water. Chase after the key.

Problem:
A red fish swallowed my key! How can I get it back?

Hint:
Follow  the fish  and try  to get  the key  back! Chase  him through  the reef.
Eventually he will be eaten by a giant sea anemone.

Problem:
How do I get  the key back from the fish if it  has been swallowed by the giant
sea anemone?

Hint:
You can still get the key. To get it  back, you need to use the fishing lure on
the  giant anemone.  The fishing  lure was  on one  of the  steel beams  of the
underwater oil rig.

Problem:
Where is the floating orb?

Hint:
Did you  see a toilet  stuck in the  ocean floor beside  the sunken submersible
vehicle?  Use Poseidon's  Trident to  pry off  the toilet  tank lid. Remove the
float. That's your floating orb!

Problem:
Is there anything I can do with the sunken vehicle beside the oil rig?

Hint:
Yes,  search  the  vehicle.  You'll  find  a  very  useful  item  in one of its
compartments.

7. Reef Caves

Problem:
I'm in a dark cave. How do I see in here?

Hint:
You need to capture the flashlight fish from  the ear of the Colossus Head in a
jar? Release  that flashlight fish from  the jar into the  cave. Just click the
jar cursor on the cave. Things should brighten up a bit.

Problem:
Okay, I can see in the cave. What do I do?

Hint:
At the back  of the cave is a  secret opening covered with rocks.  Use the hand
cursor to remove these rocks one at a time. Now the opening will be revealed to
you.

Problem:
I can't fit through the secret opening!

Hint:
You need to  remove more rocks. Just use  the hand cursor on the  opening until
you've removed them all.

Problem:
Delphineus keeps telling me that it's not safe to go through the opening!

Hint:
Use the look cursor  just below the opening. You should find  a metal box. When
you open this metal box, you'll find a protective suit. To put on the suit, use
the hand  cursor on it. If  you need to wear  it a second time,  open the metal
box, and then  use the hand cursor on  the suit again. Once you're  wearing the
suit, you can safely go through the opening.

Problem:
Where do I find a key to the metal box?

Hint:
Just one screen to the right of the  Colossus Head is an opening to a small air
pocket under the reef. In that air pocket is a pirate skeleton pinned down by a
Conquistador's Pike.  After removing the Pike,  a key will fall  into the water
and land on the ocean floor. This is the key you need.

Problem:
I have a key, but it won't turn in the rusted lock.

Hint:
A little oil would be useful now. Remember  the rag you used to clean the conch
shell? It should be pretty oily. Use this oily rag on the box, then try to turn
the lock with your key.

Problem:
There are several barrels of toxic waste here! How do I get rid of them?

Hint:
Did you read the blackboard back in  the Research Lab? You need three things to
get rid of the  barrels: you need the float from the  toilet on the ocean floor
beside the oil rig, the cable from  the octopus' lair, and the transmitter from
the Research Center. Assemble these three  items in your inventory and then use
them on the barrels.

Problem:
I can't get out of the cave because of the reef shark!

Hint:
You'll have to turn around and find another exit out of the cave.

Problem:
I've found a wrecked harpooning vessel. What should I do?

Hint:
Look around this area  carefully. You should see a cave in  the mountain far in
the distance. Use the hand cursor on this cave and watch what happens!

8. Saving Cetus

Problem:
Delphineus and I are trapped in a net! How do we escape?

Hint:
Cut the net with the sharp shell that Epidermis, the Angelfish, gave you.

Problem:
I escaped from the net, but Delphineus has been captured by Flesh-Eater! How do
I save him?

Hint:
You need to find Cetus. Start by exploring the sunken harpooning vessel.

Problem:
I've explored the wreck but still can't find Cetus!

Hint:
Did  you notice  that the  door to  the boat  is slightly  ajar? Use Poseidon's
Trident on the door and you'll be able  to open the door. Swim through the boat
and  you'll see  the harpoon  cable drifting  upward. Follow  this cable up and
you'll find Cetus.

Problem:
I've found Cetus. How do I help him?

Hint:
You need to remove  the harpoon, but you can't do this  from outside his mouth.
First talk to him. When he falls  unconscious, swim away from him until you see
a distant view of Cetus. Now swim inside  his mouth. If you time it just right,
you'll be able to swim inside.

Problem:
How do I remove the harpoon?

Hint:
Swim inside of  Cetus' mouth. You'll need a  hacksaw to cut off the  tip of the
harpoon. You can  find the hacksaw either in the  sunken submersible vehicle or
on the deck in the rear of the wrecked harpooning vessel. After cutting off the
tip  of the  harpoon, swim  outside his  mouth and  use the  hand cursor on the
harpoon to remove it.

Problem:
How do I heal Cetus?

Hint:
Use the Guardian of the Greens' healing potion on his wound.

Problem:
Cetus is fighting Flesh-Eater. How do I set Delphineus free?

Hint:
To free Delphineus,  use the hand cursor on Flesh-Eater's  cave to enter it and
cut the net  with the sharp shell that Epidermis,  the Angelfish, gave you. Now
Delphineus will be free.

Problem:
I've freed Delphineus, How do I help Cetus?

Hint:
Remember the  Lionfish spine Olympia gave  you? It's time to  use it! Click the
Lionfish spine on Flesh-Eater when he's distracted by Cetus. Timing on this can
be tricky. You may  need to try it a few times.  Once you catch Flesh-Eater off
guard, you can pierce his skin with the Lionfish spine, and Cetus will reign as
king once again. Congratulations! You've won EcoQuest!

             EcoQuest : The Search for Cetus

Introduction

You play the role of young Adam, who join Delphineus, the dolphin 
on  a  quest to find the great whale, King Cetus. First you must 
gain  the trust  of the citizens of Eluria before they help you. 
Next you  are to fullfil  the prophecy of the Oracle and to save 
Eluria.

Walkthru

You begin the quest at your home. Talk with your father. Look at 
the seagull.  Poor thing, it's covered with oil. Take the detegent 
and the  rag beside the  box. Pour some detegent on the rag and use 
it to clean  the seagull. Before  your father leave, he'll pass you 
a bottle of  fertilizer and a transmitter.  Look at the tank of 
water. It's full of  oil, pour some of the fetilizer inside  and 
let the bacteria eats up  the  oil. Look at the cage, the gerbil 
is thirsty.  Get the water  beside the  cage and give it to the 
gerbil. 

Take the letter on the chair. It contains your certificate and a 
membership  card. Take the letter on the chair and dump it in the 
recycle box. Look  at the  computer. Look at it a second time to 
play King Quest V. Get  the aluminium can  on the table and throw 
into the recycle box. Pick up  the trash bag. Look at  the  
blackboard.  Click on the individual part of  the drawing for more  
details. 

It's time to leave the room. Open the door with the combination 
number  9731.  You are now inside the swimming pool. Read the 
instructions on  the blackboard.  Talk to dolphin a few times. Get 
mackeral from the  bucket and feed the dolphin  a few times. Go 
inside the pool and ride  the dolphin. Get the frisbee and  throw 
it at the dolphin. Play with  the dolphin until it starts talking. 
Talk  to it. It's name is  Delphineus.  Throw the frisbee at the 
dolphin a few more  times. Look  at the propeller  and see how it 
was kept safe. Pull the lever  beside  the gate to open  the hatch. 
The dolphin will then swim away.

Days Passed...

The dolphin has return. Open the cabinet and get the swimming gear.  
Wear  the swimming gear and enter the sea.
Swim around until you 
reach   the  cruiser. Pick up all the rubbish with your trash bag. 
Pick up the  bottle.

(Note : I did not manage to stop the cruiser oil leak, maybe you 
can  figure it out yourself.)

Swim to the left until you see an island. Put on your oxygen tank 
and  dive into the water. Swim in the weed until you have found 
the  city of  Eluria.

Swim to Eluria. Pick up the iron cage and gather all the rubbish. 

Enter the temple. Get the bronze couch shell. Swim outside. Look at 
the  statue  with the trident. Give the couch shell to the servant, 
take the  trident. Go  to the temple again. Use the trident to poke 
the three eyes.  The Oracle appears, talk to it. Arrange the mosiac. 
The Oracle will then  ask you three riddles and tell you to click 
on  the picture to answer it.  For my case the 3 answers are : MAN, 
FISH  and LOVE. (I don't know whether  everytime the same riddles 
will be  asked or not) The oracle will tell you  to gain the trust 
of the  citizens of Eluria before it tell you the  prophecy. 

Swim outside. Enter the building with a few pillar. Talk to the 
golden  mask. Turn the pillar until all 9 parts are in the correct 
position.  Talk to the hermit crab, Superfluous. Exit. 

Swim to royal garden. Pick up all the trash. Use the fertilizer to 
remove  the  oil from the coral. The lobster, Demeter, will appear 
and give you a  healing  potion. Pick up the oily shell that have 
just fallen. Exit. 

Swim to fish department. Pick up all the trash, and get the cotton 
cloth.  Use  the cotton cloth to clean the oily shell. Exit. 

Go to find the hermit crab and give the shell to it. It will give 
you a  badge.

Swim to the fish department. The watchman, Gregarious, will appear 
when  you  try to enter any of the department. Show the badge to it 
to gain  entry. At  this time, a blowfish was caught in a plastic 
bag. Push it  into it's apartment. Remove the plastic bag from it. 
The blowfish,  Narcissus, will give you some  sea urchin. 

Enter the apartment of the anglefish, Epiderm
is. Talk to it. Use 
the  sea  urchins to eat up the algae from the plant. You get a 
sharp shell  as a reward.

Look for the apartment of the swordfish, Hippocrates. Cut the six 
pack  rings  using the shell. You receive a fish bone tweezer as a 
reward.  Pick up the 6  pack rings. Cut it with the shell and then 
trash it.

Look for Erraneous, the turtle apartment. Talk to it. Pull the 
string  out of  it mouth and use the fish bone tweezer to remove 
the balloon.  The turtle will give you 4 screws. Put the balloons 
into your trash  bag.

Look for the watchman apartment. Talk to it. Follow it to the 
surface.  Talk to fisherman. Use the 4 screws on the cage and then 
use it to fix  the  propeller.

Return to the fish apartment. Pick up the water pump and remove 
the  additional trash. Enter Olympic, the lionhead fish apartment. 
Remove  the  chlorine bottle  and use the water pump to clean up 
the chlorine.  Talk to  lionhead fish, get a  spine from it.

Now, you are ready to attend the meeting. After the meeting, get 
the  gold mask. Enter the temple. Show the gold mask to the Oracle 
and it  will  give you the prophecy. Exit Eluria.

Swim to the giant head. Pick up the mirror and remove all the trash. 
If  you  have clean up all the rubbish in the game, you receive a 
certain  award and  gain some additional points. 

Swim right until you reach the anemore, enter the cave there. Look 
the  a  key  on the skeleton. Pull the pike out (twice). Open the 
chest to  free  the crab.  Swim out the cave. Get the key. Too 
late,  the red fish  swallowed it. There is  no need to follow the 
red fish  immediately. So,  do the following task when you  reach 
appropriate  screen. 

At the octopus place, pull the cable. Then show the mirror to the 
octopus  and  then get the cable. 

At the submarine, use the trident to open the box to get the 
floating  bulb.  Pick up the fish lure. Open the storing cabinet 
behind the seat  and get the  hacksaw, trash the hammer head. 

Swim to the toxic cave, touch the red fish. It's wil
l swim back to 
the  anemore.

At the octopus, use the bottle on the octopus. Hide inside the 
plant  and watch  what happened. The octopus has opened the 
bottle for you.  Get the bottle. 

Swim back to the anemore, the red fish is being eaten by the 
anemore.  Use the  fish lure on it. Since the anemore can only 
can't digest the  key, it got vomit  out. Get the skeleton key.

Go to the giant head. Use the bottle on the ear to catch the 
flashlight  fish. 

Swim to the toxic cave. Release the flashlight fish to light up 
the  cave.  There is a brick wall inside the cave. Remove the 
brick one by  one until you  see something among the rocks. Look 
at the rock, there  is a metal box hidden  there. Use the oily 
rag to ease the lock, and  then open it with the skeleton  key. 
There is a suit inside, get it  and wear it. Enter the hole. 
Attach the  followings together: floating  bulb, transmitter and 
cable. Then tied them to  the barrels of toxic.

Wait for the divers to clear up the toxic...

Swim through the toxic cave to reach the boat. Use the trident to 
open  the cabin door. Watch out, flesh-eater is behind you. Swim 
all the way  until you are caught in the drift net. Use the shell 
to cut yourself  free. In the meantime, the dolphin is captured 
by  flesh-eater. 

Swim to the boat, use the trident to open the cabin door. Enter 
the  cabin door  and follow the cable until you found King Cetus. 
Talk to  it. Swim away until  you see the full view of it. Click 
the hand on  Cetus mouth to enter its mouth.  Use the hacksaw to 
cut the harpoon  shaft. Swim outside and pull the shaft out.  Use 
the healing potion  on the wound to save Cetus.

Follow Cetus to the boat. Swim to the manta's cave when Cetus is 
fighting  with it. Use the shell to cut the drift net to free the 
Delphineus.  Swim outside. Use the spine to attack flesh-eater. 
Note  that you must  attack at the right time. When you have 
strike  the  manta, Cetus will  defeat it.

From here onwards, just sit back and watch the ending.

Well Done !!!
You have completed the game.

        ECSTATICA
        ---------

        For the love of one
        shall briefly disclose the matters of mine
        which the Ancients do Alcamye call
        or others, Alchemy.
        Wherefore, it is here, understand you shall,
        this wonderful art and gift of the Almighty
        which was never found by labour of man,
        but it, by teaching or revelation began.

        He, and more surely she, so as I find,
        of noble mind, who
        searched nature will find this art,
        in manner of physik
        and magic natural.
        But
        all these writings are very dark
        despise all books and them defy
        wherein is nothing but recipe and accipe.
        Few learned men within this realm
        can tell thee aright what I do mean;
        I could never find man but one,
        which could teach me the secret of Alcamye
        and that was the old man on the close of Tirich,
        the guardian of our castle.

        This olde philosopher wise
        by wey of kind in sundry wise
        a deamon made prisoner
        of the stone circle.
        This devil, one of the worst, so as I finde,
        through our craft only could be defeated
        the nature of evil
        both in substance and figure.

        But teacheth the great worke
        a foule labour,
        not fit for lesser men or women,
        in which is found great travail
        with many perils and many a faille.

        Whomsoever thou art that presumest to dive
        into the fountain of work and hopes to obtain
        by ambitious enterprise,
        the reward of our arte,
        I tell thee by the eternal creator
        for a truth, for all truth
        being small is going far.

        If thou keep thy secrets in store unto thy shelve
        thou hast conquered the power
        and all the devils thou holdyst at will,
        maybe
        for wise men done say store is no sore,
        but women know more...

        A prelude...
        ------------

        I started out on my journey in good spirits, riding through the
        lowlands and enjoying the solitude, as my horses hooves beat out a
        relaxing rhythm. Finding a waterfall above a deep pool I swam and
        refreshed myself, stretching out in the afternoon sun to dry.
        Perhaps we lingered too long though....
        Trying to make up time, I pushed my stallion hard....too hard, and the
        rough country and burning heat took it's toll on horse and rider.
        Travelling through this part of the country is a demanding experience,
        treacherous mountain paths criss-cross endlessly, and more experienced
        riders than me have become hopelessly lost. The sun was starting its
        descent as we rode past a monastery, the twilight engulfing us in
        disturbing shadows. In the deepeing gloom we found ourselves
        at a cross-roads just outside a small village....
        It had seemed the right thing to do at the time. With darkness falling,
        water and shelter were needed.
        The village was on the far side of a small bridge. A short distance to
        travel, for sure, but as I crossed that bridge, the atmosphere seemed
        to change, as quickly as a thunderstorm can turn the weather on a
        summer's day. On reaching the other side, I could feel that something
        was amiss....
        Everything was still, and quiet as the grave. There were no children
        playing, no women cooking an evening meal, no men joking and laughing
        on the way home from the tavern.... what could be wrong?
        A shop to my right looks harmless enough, but why is the door hanging
        from its hinges and what are those foul scrawls daubed on the walls?
        What the... Oh my god........


        An objective...
        ---------------

        You have arrived in a village that seems to be deserted. However,
        you'll soon discover that first appearences can be very deceptive.
        The village of Tirich is under the influence of dark, supernatural
        forces that have manifested themselves in a menagerie of ghouls and
        demons.
        Your survival depends upon your ability to discover why strange
        creatures prowl otherwise peaceful streets. You must free Tirich from
        this unholy spell, or perish trying. A diary may provide some clues as
        to why these fearful events have come to pass, and that's as good a
        place as any to begin your quest...

        Controls:
        ---------

        Ecstatica's controls, via the numeric keypad on your keyboard, remain
        consistent throughout the game.
        You can move your character forwards in the direction that he/she is
        facing, via the '8' key, regardless of which viewing perspective the
        in-game editor editor offers you. (i.e., regardless of whether you are
        moving into, or out of, the screen).
        The keypad controls via the numeric keypad:
        1 - Pick up, or put down, an object with your left hand (note that
            your character one object in either hand at any one time)
        2 - Walk backwards
        3 - Pick up, or put down an object with your right hand
        4 - Turn left
        5 - Dodge
        6 - Turn right
        7 - Hit with the left hand (or held object/weapon etc.)

        9 - Hit with the right hand (object/weapon etc.)
        Your character's movement modes are...
        F1, F2, F3, F4 - Stealth (very useful for sneaking past enemies who
        are best not disturbed...)
        F5, F6, F7, F8 - Walk (quicker than stealth, but not too fast for
        comfort)
        F9, F10, F11, F12 - Run (might just get you out of trouble, but be
        careful you don't simply run out of the frying pan and into the fire)

Ecstatic Walkthrough Lite v1.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Typed and figgured out by MuggZ@IRC

Disclaimer: This is a VERY lite walkthrough that shows you the QUICKEST way
to get to the end. I don't explain everything near the end (Gotta keep the game
fun anyway..), so don't bitch and moan. I give away most of the secrets, so just
read and figgure it out. Have fun, and talk to me if you have any questions.

P.S. Don't try killing the wolfman, he's a bitch and a half. Wait till you have
a magic item.


	First off, walk forwards and to the right, if the Wolfman doesn't jump
you, go into the first door on your left. There should be some sort of key type
sign, and you should be able to see the church behind your character in the 
background. 

	Enter the building, there should be someone (An old Knight) fighting
a green Dragon. Wait till the Dragon defeats the Knight, and hope that it flies
out of the room. Pick up the Knight's bludgon, then hang around and talk to
him. You'll pick him up and take him to the building that is on your right when
you begin the game. There will be a man lying on the ground holding a key, if
all goes right, you shouldn't need to pick up the key because the Knight will
open the door for you.

	Once inside, ignore the Knight unless you give a shit about the plot,
then go to the shelves to the right of the door (To the right, as if you are
just entering the room), and pick up the vegitable laying on it. It's part
of a magic potion.

	Next, go outside, you should be at the 'beginning' point basically.
Now, go to your right again down the alley, go to the end of the alley until
you get to the door that you'll be facing. Open it, go inside. There should be
a demon sitting at the foot of the stairs drinking, kill him, go up the stairs,
you'll be in a bedroom. Go up the stairs to your right, you'll automatically
put the vegitable into the device.

	Now, go outside to the front of the door, go straight forwards, you'll
be inside the church. Grab the little stick figure thing that is laying to the
right of the altar. Go back to the room where you put the vegitable, put it
in the device. 

	Go back to the church, grab the bible, now, head back to the doorway
that leads to the demon you killed that was drinking.. Go left down the alley,
keep on going that direction until you find an opening that will lead to 
vegitation and grass. 

	There are two options at this point, to the right, and to the left.
Go to the left, it will lead down a path, and in the distance you will see
a beggar walking in front of a small fortress. (An Abbey). At this point
the Wolfman might try to attack you from behind, if he does, just FUCKING
RUN, towards the abbey. He is IMPOSSIBLE to kill with any weapon short of a
magical one. Trust me, I've fought him literally for 30 minutes with the best
sword available, and it DOES NOT work. Once you get to the abbey, you should
read the book automatically and get let in. If the Wolfman is following you,
go inside the abbey, look around a little bit, do NOT go down the hole in the
library, just walk around the different rooms. 

	If you do this for about 5 minutes, the wolfman should go away. At
this point walk outside of the Abbey, drop the Bible in front of the abbey,
then walk down the path towards the town. There will be a flower, pick it up.
It's the last part of the magic potion. Go back to the room where you put
the other two ingredients, but BEFORE you go into the room (When you are in
the bedroom..), DROP the flower, and pick up the teddy bear. Go outside again,
head towards the Church, turn to the right as soon as you get past the building
on your right.. Walk straight forwards, then once you are inside the Barn,
you should automatically throw the teddy. At this point, the girl will start
walking and ask you to follow. Do so, she'll try to go into a hole you're
too big to go into under the Church. But she will open up the Dungeon for you.
Go down the dungeon, there will be like.. 6 skeletons. Easy to kill, then go
down even further, until you get to the bottom. You'll freak out and run back
to the top. At this point, go BACK to the bedroom where you dropped the flower.
Pick the flower up, and go and put it in the device, and you've got the
potion. 

	At this point, you'll drink the potion and turn into a beaver or some
shit. Go back to the place where the girl tried to take you, but you were too
big. Now.. you're just the right size. Cruise down the little hallway until
you get to some stairs, at this point you should turn back into a human. Kill
the gnomes if you want, then go up the stairs. You'll open a trap door an 
there will be an old man waving a sword. Hang around for a bit and he'll drop
it and you can get it. Drop the bludgon, and the sword. Pick up the sword, and
you'll automatically wield it. Now pick up the bludgon. You'll need it.

	Now, go outside, and go back to where the path leads in two directions,
(One being the Abbey, and the other being..?).. You'll have to fight and kill
two Minotaurs, but with the sword you now have, it should be easy once you get
the rythm down.

	Anyway, you'll towards a castle, take the steps _DOWN_ towards the
fountian. Walk past the fountian and keep going that direction. At this point
you'll find a lake, stand on the rock, you'll automatically throw the sword 
into it, and get Knighted by the Lady of the lake. NOW, turn around, go back
towards the castle, do not take the front enterance, take the SIDE enterance
on the right. You'll get let in, and be told to go to the tower. Go to the
tower, don't bother going up. Go straight down. At the bottom there will be
a statue that will swing at you, if you time it right you can duck and walk
forwards and he won't hit you. Keep going forwards, there will be 2 phantom
warriors that will try to attack you, just smack them around, they die quick.
Then, go forward more until you get to the room that has downwards staircases,
take the RIGHT side of the room (The one with the fire breathing stone dragon),
walk around the edge of the room, take the stairs down.. (If you go the other
side, a spike will come up and kill you).. Once you're in the centre of the
first two sets of stair, get to the farthest right (Perspective right), and
hop down to the next set of stairs that is on the perspective right. If you
do this, you won't get nailed by the second spike. 

	Now, go down those stairs, avoid the spikes in the floor, go into the
center room. There will be two coffins standing on end.. Walk past the first
one, a skeleton should pop out, kill it. Walk past the second one, it'll open
up showing a Skeleton wearing armor. Walk past it again and towards it until
it closes on you, and opens up again.. poof, you got armor. Now, go to the
outside of the inner room (Where the floor has spikes that come up and tag
you..), and pick an enterance that has gargoles around it. There are three,
I won't tell you which one or the directions.. Gotta make it somewhat fun. ;)

	But, one of them will have two naked guys fanning.. You can lie down
on the bed they're fanning on. It'll have two other exits other than the one
you came in. One of them will be a stairwell down, (The perspective will show
you being at the top with the 'Camera' being at the very bottom. do NOT go
down here JUST yet..). The other exit in this room (The one with the guys
fanning) is a death trap. So avoid it.

	Another one is a prison cell with two guards. Avoid this one.

	The last room (The last of the three that you can get to from the room
with the spikes that come out of the floor) will have a ghostly beaver, it'll
tell you some things.. grab the BOOK, and go UP and OUT. Go BACK to the Abbey,
grab the Holy Relic (That the two monks are worshipping.) At this point you 
might have to kill them all. Now, you'll have to drop your bludgon to get the
book. It's cool. Just do it. Now go to the stone circle (If you walked around
you'll know where it is, I've coddled you enough!).. And get in the center,
bam shablam, you now have a fireball shooting relic. Drop the magic book (You
don't need it..), Now go back down the tower till you get to the bottom, (The
room where the naked guys fan..), find the stairwell that the perspective will
show you being at the top of, walk down.. You will fight against 'yourself',
shoot a fireball at yourself, you'll die. (The alternate you will..) Then talk
to the king for a few minutes, then run back to where you picked up the magic
Book. The demon's head should now be gone and the door will be open. The rest
explains itself.

                      ELVIRA II: THE JAWS OF CERBERUS 
 
  PICK YOUR OCCUPATION, NOT YOUR NOSE 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  When the game begins, you'll be asked whether you want to restore a saved 
  game. If you choose not to restore a saved game, then you'll have to 
  pick your occupation (see OCCUPATIONS below). When you restore a saved 
  game, your occupation remains the same as it was when you saved the 
  game. 
 
  OCCUPATIONS 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Your stats are set at the beginning of the adventure, when you select 
  your occupation. Here's what you start with: 
 
 
  OCCUPATION      WS      ACC     WP      MR      PR      CON   STR   INT 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Stuntman        10      6       10      6       9       8      10     6 
  Private Eye      9      9       9       8       8       9       8     9 
  Programmer       6      8       6      10      10       6       6    10 
  Knife Thrower    8     10       8       8       6      10       9     8 
 
  These numbers increase as you gain experience and may change with 
  different circumstances. Naturally, stats increase at different rates 
  depending on your occupation. For your latest health report, click on 
  the body icon on the right side of the screen 
 
 
                           THE MAIN SCREEN 
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The Action Window 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  If you've ever seen a movie, you know what the action window does. (If 
  you've never seen a movie, then you probably aren't from around here, 
  and probably have no business playing with computers, either). This is 
  where the fun happens ... blood, gore, mayhem, death, blood, paranormal 
  phenomena, battle with goons from the great beyond, blood, plunder, 
  carnage ... did I mention that there's blood? 
 
  Moving Around 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  *       Click on the direction arrows at the lower right of the main 
          screen to move forward, back, left, right, turn around, or climb 
          up or down. 
 
  *       If you want to move toward an object, click directly on the 
          object to move in closer. 
 
  *       To open a closed door, just click on it. 
 
  Looking at Stuff 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  If you see something in the action window that you want to know more 
  about, here's what you do: 
 
  1       Click on the object, then drag it into your inventory 
  2       Click on the object again 
  3       Click directly on the examine box 
  4       Read all about the object 
 
  If you're able to do other stuff with the object you've selected these 
  options will appear just below the examine command. For more about this, 
  read the command menu section. 
 
  Getting to Know the Locals: Conversations 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Sometimes you get lucky, and somebody you meet will actually want to 
  talk to you instead of disemboweling you. When the person or thing in 
  the action window is interest in chatting, a mouth icon appears at the 
  right of the screen. Here's what to do: 
 
  1       Click on the mouth icon 
  2       Read the dialog options that appear 
  3       Click on the desired dialog option 
  4       Wait for response and more dialog options 
  5       Repeat this procedure from step 2 until encounter ends 
 
  Souvenir Collecting 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  *       Click the suitcase icon in the upper right corner to bring up 
          your inventory 
  *       To add something to your inventory, simply drag it from the 
          action window down onto the message box, or the suitcase icon 
  *       To use an item in your inventory, click on the item, then select 
          the option that appears on the right side of the screen. Some 
          objects can be dragged from your inventory and used on an object 
          in the action window in order to complete an action sequence. 
 
  You can carry an amazing amount of stuff, so feel free to help yourself 
  to anything that isn't staked down. On the other hand, greed doesn't 
  always pay - in fact, it can cost you plenty in strength. If you're 
  expecting unpleasant company and want to travel light, go ahead and drop 
  some of your goodies, they'll still be there when you get back. 
 
  Direction Arrows: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Without these arrows, you ain't going nowhere. Wherever you are, look at 
  the highlighted yellow arrows in this area to find out what your 
  movement options are. 
 
  The Tell-Tale Heart: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  That beating heart on the main screen represents the current state of 
  your body. The beating speeds up if you panic, and slows down as you get 
  a grip on yourself. If you get hurt, it slows way down. If it stops, 
  you're dead. 
 
  The number next to the heart is what you want to keep an eye on. It is a 
  sum of all the individual hit points from the various parts of your 
  body. 
 
  "The Corpus Delectable" (Health Status Indicator): 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The guy in the top left corner of the screen is YOU or at least, a 
  reasonable facsimile. This is your health status indicator. The size of
  the little lines coming out of him tell you how many hit points each area 
  of the body can take before you die. Here's how you die: 
 
  *       You've been beaten about the head and shoulders so relentlessly 
          that you're down to 0 hit points for the head or chest area. 
  *       The skin and muscles and guts are ripped, tendon and sinew, off 
          your fragile mortal frame (arms and legs have been hacked off.) 
 
  If that wasn't enough for you, here's what happens if you should lose a 
  single limb: 
 
  *       If the hit point total in one of your legs drops to 0, then your 
          movement will become sluggish until you get some healing done. 
  *       If you lose an arm, then your carrying capacity drop. 
 
  Seismic Activity Sensor: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The motion sensor is a little gadget that can help you find 
  unfriendlies before they find you. As you move, the sensor will lose 
  its mind. But as soon as you stop moving, the sensor will scan the area 
  and display any movement in the vicinity. 
 
  Spellchecker: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  This gadget will let you know which spells you've got running at the 
  moment. You can have any number of spells going at one time. 
 
  Suitcase: 
  ~~~~~~~~~ 
  When you click on the suitcase icon an inventory of everything you're 
  carrying appears. 
 
  Room Scanner: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click this icon and all the stuff you've discovered so far in the room 
  appears in a message box. In addition, all items that have been dropped 
  will appear. 
 
  Spellthrower: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click on this box to display all your mixed and ready-to-cast spells. 
  Once displayed, simply click on the spell to cast it. 
 
  Spellbook: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click this box to view the spellbook, which will enable you to mix 
  spells 
 
  Combat Weapon Box: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click on this icon anytime to alter your style of fighting. 
 
  Hit Point Indicator: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Each time you smite your opponent with a weapon, this gauge gives you 
  an indication of the severity of the blow. 
 
  Damage Indicator: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  This gauge gives you an analog indication of how much damage you sustain 
  from each of your opponent's blows. 
 
  Command Menu: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Whenever you click on an item, you will be given a choice of actions to 
  take with that item. These actions will appear to the right of the main 
  viewing area. Click on the desired action to execute the action. 
 
  The Stats Bar: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  LEV - Level. Lets you know how well you're doing in your quest. As you 
  gain experience points, you will move up in levels and be able to mix 
  more powerful spells, fight hand-to-hand more effectively, increase your 
  stats and ultimately get closer to Elvira. 
 
  EXP - Experience. This number increases as you play and slay. It also 
  relates directly to your level. 
 
  PP  - Power Points. The more power points you have, the more spells you 
  can cast before a recharge. 
 
  HP  - Hit Points. Maximum hit points for your character. 
 
  Secondary Stats: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  WS    - Weapons Skill. Determines how lethal you are with your weapon. 
  ACC   - Accuracy. Determines the likely hood of hitting your target 
  WP    - Will Power. Determines the amount of guts you have 
  MR    - Magic Resist. Determines how susceptible you are to supernatural 
          charms. 
  STR   - Strength. Determines how hard you can hit 
  CONST - Constitution. Determines your total hit points and will lower 
          the damage you take from attacks. 
  PR    - Poison Resist. Determines resistance to deadly doses. 
  INT   - Intelligence. Determines power points and the number of spells 
          you get out of each mixing. 
 
  COMBAT 
  ~~~~~~ 
  As soon as an opponent appears on screen, your pointer will change into a 
  combat icon. Click on the combat weapon box to bring up a choice of 
  four combat modes. 
 
  *       Normal: Turns cursor into a sword. No advantage for either 
          fighter. 
  *       Defensive: Turns cursor into a shield. Less chance of hitting or 
          getting hit. 
  *       Fierce: Turns cursor into a lightning bolt. Better chance of 
          hitting and getting hit. 
  *       Berserk. Turns cursor into a viking helmet. Change of hitting 
          and getting hit is very great. 
 
  How to fight: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  1       Click on a choice, and the cursor will turn into the weapon 
  2       Move the weapon onto your opponent 
  3       Position the cursor over the part of the opponent's body that 
          you wish to attack, then click to slash away. Each evil critter 
          will be easier to hit in some areas than others. 
 
  Active & Inactive Weapons: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  When the cursor changes into a weapon or shield, it will appear either 
  white or black. When it is WHITE, the selected weapon is active. When it 
  is BLACK, your weapon is in the midst of a hack or slash. 
 
  Running Away: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Sometimes it's better to be a weenie. To run away, back away carefully, 
  then TURN & RUN! 
 
  SPELLCRAFTING 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Lesson One: To get even the most basic spell off the ground, you need 
  four things: 
 
  1       My Spellbook 
  2       The right ingredients to mix the spell 
  3       The level, experience, and opportunity to cast it 
  4       My red pendant 
 
  Get the Spellbook! 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Make sure to get my spellbook when you first enter the studio. If you 
  don't, you'll probably be mashed into dog chow shortly after you get past 
  the main gate. 
 
  About Spell... 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Each spell has 3 requirements that must be fulfilled before it can be 
  created. These requirements are listed under each spell in the 
  spellbook. The effect is also listed. The three requirements are: 
 
  *       Level: Each spell has a level number listed. You must be at that 
          level or higher before being eligible to create that spell. 
  *       Cost: The number of power points burned after each application 
          of a spell is listed 
  *       Ingredients: You must have all ingredients needed for a 
          particular spell in your inventory 
 
  Mixing a Spell: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Once you've got my book, you can click on the book icon in the upper 
  right of the screen any time to refer to it. There are eight spells on 
  each page, and dozens of spells in all. 
 
  *       To turn an index page: Click the book icon at the top left of 
          the page 
  *       To choose a spell for mixing: Turn to the correct index page and 
          click directly on the spell name. This brings up the description 
          of the spell, the level you need and the list of ingredients you 
          need to make it 
  *       To return to the spellbook index: Click on the book icon in the 
          upper right side of the spellbook page without mixing a spell on 
          screen. You may now choose another spell. 
  *       To mix the spell: 
 
          1       Click the mix icon at the top left of the page. Your 
                  inventory will appear. 
          2       Drag each of the ingredients from the inventory up to 
                  the page and let go. 
          3       When you've got all the items on the page, click the mix 
                  icon again. The new spell will appear as an icon in your 
                  inventory. There's no limit to the number or ready-mixed 
                  spells you can carry. 
 
  *       To exit the spellbook index: Click on exit.

  Fun Facts About Spells: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          icons disappear forever. 
  *       Some spells can be used over and over again. 
  *       Your currently active spells appear in the spellchecker at the 
          lower left of the screen. 
  *       If a spell disappears from the spellchecker list, it's run its 
          course. The same goes if you've got a spell running, but it 
          doesn't appear to be doing you any good. 
  *       The name of the spell is a good clue on what ingredients it may 
          need.

Honey

choppe them finely.  Boyle the finely chopped leaves until
totally dissolved into the water to leave a dirty brown liquid.
Blend into this liquid one jar of honey which acts as both a
sweetener and thickening agent.  Shred a handful of fern

dough-like paste.  Shape this paste into small packets and
wrap each one in a spyder web.  There is enough of the mix-
ture to make three packets.

juice.  Mix juice with the bloode sucked from five live beetles.
Stir the mixture widdershins with the tail feather of a bird
and recite my name backwards.  Store drink in a bottle untill
required.

As the ingredients for this receipt are difficult to obtain at the
same tyme, it is unlikely that more than one portion of this
poyion can be prepared in any one year.  Should you be fortu-
nate enough to obtain the necessary for more than one portion
then a second batch should be stored as though it were fine
wine.

It only takes fifteen minutes to prepare but is most powerful
in its effects.  When consmed it offers total protection to all
non-contact magick weapons and substantial protection from 
any other weapone for a considerable tyme.  It should not be
used lightly but saved until needed.

minutes.  Add a sprig of four leaf clover and continue to boyle

allow to cool whereupon it may be consumed.  This potion 
should be used judiciously as excessive consumption will cause
drowsiness and lethargy.

It takes thirty minutes to prepare.  Use of this portion will
make you react quicker unless taken to excess when it will
tend to cause the opposite effect.

PROPITIOUS SURPRISE

Required elementes: Aconite, Nettles & one Four Leaf Clover

This mixture should be prepared as Lucky Surprise but after
straining off the liquid, add three drops of aconite extract to
the decoction and stir for five minutes before bottling.  It
takes forty minutes to prepare.  This potion has the advantage
of not causing drowsiness but otherwise acts as a Lucky Sur-
prise.  The addition of Aconite must be at the tyme of prepara-
tion.  Later addition makes a deadly poison.

MONSTERA PIE

Required elementes: Monstera, Parsley & Ivy

separate a 2 cm. basketful of Monstera petals and slice into 
thumb joint sized strips.  Place the strips into a baking dish,
add the parsley and cover the contents with another layer of
Ivy leaves.  Place the baking dish in a hot oven and cook for
twenty minutes.  This receipt should provide enough for five
portions and takes thirty minutes to prepare.

Eating a slice of this pie will make the eater stronger but 
slightly slow down the eater's reactions.  This slowing is
cummulative for each slice eaten before a previously consumed
slice is fully digested.  Only the foolhardy shude try eating the
whole pie at one sitting because of this side effect.  Used with
due care, consuming a slice of pie will give the eater a useful
boost in strength when it is needed.

GLOWING PRIDE

Required elementes: Thistle, Dandelyon & Flame flower

remove the oil of which they contain.  Take one Dandelyon and
split its stem.  Allow the milky liquid contained therein to
drip into the previously extracted oil and mix thoroughly.
Pull the down from one Thistle and drop into the oil mixture
so that the down soaks up the mixture.  Roll the down into a
ball.  Thro' practice, tis possible to increase the oil yield from
each flower.

This should take fifteen minutes.  Store the soaked down in
darkness.  As soon as a prepared ball of down is removed from
complete darkness, it will begin to glow.  The length of tyme
that each ball will glow for, is directly proportional to the
user's experience.  If the user is twice as experienced the
second tyme that this magic is used then the light will last for
twice as long.  Useful in those unexpected dark places when
there is no normal light available.

MUSHROOM TENDERNESS

Required elementes: Hellebore, Elderberry & Mushroom

Slice up one bucket of mushrooms and then boyle them untill

simmer for twenty minutes or until it thickens.  Pour into a
suitable container.  It may be eaten either hot or cold.

eaten, this powerful mixture has two effects.  The minor result
of its use, is a boost to strength and general health but the
major effect provides the eater with a large number of
Tunderflash Spelles which can inflict serious damage on the
enemy.

sediment on consecrated ground, failing to do so will cause
you moste serious regrets.

equips anyone who drinks it with a terrible weapon.  For this

that you are likely to make only once in a lifetime.  Careless-
ness in making it can also ensure that you only get to make it
once in a lifetime.

number of Fearful Spelles that do an amazing amount of
damage to any normal creature.

POSTSCRIPTUM

Brain Ache:

When this spelle is cast upon an opponent, it reduces dexterity
by a random amount for the duration of the fight.  It may be
used only once in any single confrontation.

Fearful:

This awesome spelle does terrible damage to any standard
opponent upon whom it is cast.

Fingerlight:

This more potent fight spelle casts a fork of lightning at an
opponent causing damage when it hits.

Fire Dagger:

This spelle appears and acts like a flaming, thrown dagger but
doing three times the damage of a dagger unless the target is
immune to fire.  Used against a mummy, there is a chance of it
catching fire.

Fire Wall:

Lasting for 10 seconds each time it is used, this spelle stops an
opponent attacking and allows the caster to use a ranged
weapone or run away.  It also destroys any ice-based weapon
as well as severely damaging any wooden weapones but these
effects also apply to the caster's weapons.

Ice Wall:

The ice version of Fire Wall, it lasts twice as long but is
almost instantly destroyed by fire-based weapones and only
allows the caster to use ice spelles for its duration.

Identify Plant:

This magickal ability is essential to allow identification of the
many plant ingredients used in the magickal arts.  It is gained
by consuming Herbal Honey.

Knightyme Pleasure:

This is the greatest defensive spelle in that it eliminates all
effects from magickal ranged weapones and halves the effect
of any other weapone.

Lucky Surprise:

This potion increases the imbiber's dexterity by one tenth for
each swig but if more than one swig is taken before an earlier
one wears off this is partially negated by becoming drowsy.

Maiden's Turnover:

This causes a magickal hardening of the eater's skin which
effectively halves sword damage for a tyme.

Manticore Flip:

Similar to Maiden's Turnover but reduces sword damage to
one tenth for a much longer tyme.

Mind Locke:

This spelle is similar to Tangled Mind but of even greater
intensity.

Palmlight:

A more powerful version of Fingerlight that casts ball light-
ning at an opponent for even greater damage.

Propitious Surprise:

Similar effect to Lucky Surprise but without the drowsiness 
disadvantage for multiple swigs.

Runic Reading:

This is the ability to read and understand runic writing which
is necessary to understanding and can be obtained by drinking
Alphabet Soup.

Sizzling Egges:

This gives an offensive spelle equivalent to hitting an oppo-
nent somewhat harder than the deadliest concussive weapon.

Tangled Mind:

Similar to Brain Ache but reduces dexterity by a greater
amount.

Thunderflash:

When cast at an opponent this spelle acts as a percussion
weapon which inflicts extensive damage.

FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD - TIPS - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE ZTT ROOM
 
 There are two methods to get past the bullets. You can wear the flak jacket
and shoot away the wall but the seconds method is easier, especially if you 
have no jacket. Move to the far left of the room and start shooting. 
Miraculously the wall will be shot away even though you aren't facing it.
If you complete the puzzle you can go to the shooting gallery or you can go
to talking heads if you press one of the three buttons at the bottom of the
screen.

RAID OVER MERSEYSIDE

 To complete the game just aim your game near the top or middle of the screen
and keep the streams of bullets coming out. It should't be to much hassle to
get through without losing any pleasure points.

SHOOTING GALLERY
 
 When you have shot at your target it is possible to save time by pressing
the fire button again even through the booklet says you have to go to the
bottom of the screen.

THE MURDER MYSTERY
 
 This is very easy because it is always Mr Straight but before you can reveal
this you must first find all 23 clues

TALKING HEADS

 This is quite a simple game to complete. Just shoot out the top blocks and
shoot through them until you have to move to avoid being shot. Then move to 
the bottom of the screen and quickly back to the top and start shooting.
By alternating between the top of the screen and the bottom it is possible to
slowly chip the Russians points away.

SEA OF HOLES

 This room is more frustrating than anything so just persevere and you will
finally complete it after a bit of practice.

THE WAR ROOM

 When you enter this room move to the far right. As soon as the symbols,
shoot at them. The first time you hit a symbol you haven't hit before then
the pleasure bar relevant to that symbol goes up.

THE CORRIDORS OF POWER
 
 The important thing to remember is that you are not in an ordinary maze.
The doors to the rooms are normal at the top end of the corridors. You can 
only depart from the corridors of power if you're hit by a fireball or you
enter a room.from: the Asimov collection



                                     FISH!
                          (Rainbird/Magnetic Scrolls)

    You start swimming upside down in a goldfish bowl in the body of a
    goldfish, enjoying a month's break between jobs after foiling the Seven
    Deadly Fins who unfortunately got away. Suddenly a tacky plastic castle
    drops into the bowl. You realise there's a message in the castle for
    you.

    "Turn over" , "in" . Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission  HQ, says
    the Fins are up to their old tricks again. They've stolen a focus wheel
    and dismantled it. You must find the pieces.

    A glass box and three warps appear. The warps are jagged, smooth and
    small. The box is closed.

    The Small Warp

    "Go through small warp". You find yourself in a recording studio. The
    producer tells you to make a cup of coffee. The kitchen is locked and
    you can't enter it. Rod is standing nearby so "Rod, make coffee" ; he
    does so and will do whenever you are asked to make it.

    Examine the bin to find a ferric cassette. Get it. Go to the far west
    end of the corridor, open wooden door and "switch switch" it puts a
    light on in the room to the south so you can enter. Go in and get the
    metal and chrome cassettes.

    Go back to the corridor and open secondary door. Close the door and
    press the button. This switches on the red light outside so when the
    producer comes to get you to make more coffee, he thinks you're working
    and goes away again.

    Open small cupboard, get head cleaner from it. "Play cleaner in player"
    (Note, don't put it in or a bug stops you completing this bit). Examine
    amplifier; it has one fader which is used to set the volume and can be
    set from 0 to 11 and is currently on 0. If you try to play a tape, you
    can't hear it so "set fader to 3".

    "Play ferric cassette in player, play chrome cassette in player, play
    metal cassette in player" (any order). When the third tape is played,
    you hear the producer's voice reminding them of the beat eg no, like
    this, 3,4,2 (random).

    Leave this room and go and open door to the office. Go in and examine
    the filing cabinet. It has a combination lock on it, set to a random
    number. "Set lock to 342" or whatever you heard on the tape. The
    cabinet is now unlocked. Open it, look into it. You see a spindle. Get
    it. The Fins try to stop you but you escape to the goldfish bowl where
    the spindle falls into the glass box.

    The Smooth Warp

    "Go through smooth warp". You are in a human body by a tree stump in a
    forest. Examine the stump; inside is a gold disc and micky Blowtorch,
    an ex-operative who has gone warp-crazy. He won't let you take the disc
    and be careful not to go near him when you are carrying anything you
    find.

    Go to the smithy. Inside is a bird cage containing a parrot and a
    mould. The parrot will explode after a certain number of moves. Open
    the cage; the parrot won't leave and you can't get it out. Leave the
    location, it flies out into the forest where it will explode later.

    Go back in, open the cupboard to see some tongs, a crucible and a
    hammer. On the cupboard is a pair of gloves.

    Go back to the stump and wait till Micky leaves. He goes se to the wet
    forest. Get the disc and go s,s,e,e,e back to the smithy so you don't
    meet him.
    You only have a limited number of moves to complete this bit.

    Get the mould and everything from the cupboard. Wear the gloves. "Put
    disc in crucible, hold crucible with tongs, hold crucible in fire"; the
    disc melts, leaving a puddle of molten gold in the crucible.

    "Pour gold into mould". You now need to cool it and this can only be
    done in the cool glade but in certain areas it is raining and you must
    also not go past Micky! So go to the charred glade, n, ne to the dim
    forest, e to the cool glade.

    Wait three times, the mould cools. "Break mould with hammer". You see a
    crude gold ring. Get ring; one of the Fins appears but you just get the
    ring in time. You arrive back in the goldfish bowl, the ring drops into
    the glass box.

    The Jagged Warp.

    "Go through jagged warp". You are in a human body in the back of a van.
    Get and wear all the clothes. Ignore the blanket. In the front of the
    van is a note from Steve saying he's gone to get some diesel and will
    be back before dawn. "Search rubbish" to find a torch. "Light torch" or
    you can't leave the van. Go east to leave the van.

    If you aren't wearing all the clothes, your skin catches the light by
    the fire and alerts the hippies. Go to pew, get it. Turn torch off (or
    the beam wavers and alerts the hippies) and go to the ruined transcept
    and archway. Drop the pew here.

    Go down to catacombs, "search debris" to find a sarcophagus lid. Get
    it; you see an exit leading down. Drop lid.

    In the altar room, "examine altar"; one side has a hole where are
    gargoyle should be. There's a ceremonial cord on the altar. Get it.
    Go back to pew and "get on pew", go up to archway. "Tie cord to
    gargoyle", down, "pull cord"; you pull down the gargoyle and the arch
    making a terrible noise and the hippies look your way.

    Get gargoyle, go to catacombs, get lid and "put lid in doorway". The
    hippies arrive outside and talk. They decide you've been killed by the
    collapsing ceiling and leave.

    "Untie cord", go to altar room and "put gargoyle in hole"; the altar
    sinks into the ground as a column descends from the ceiling. "Examine
    column"; there's a chalice in a niche in it. "Look in chalice"; there's
    a grommet in it. "Get chalice".
    Get grommet; the hippies try to stop you and their leader (one of the
    Fins) tells you to hand it over. Suddenly a hole opens in the ceiling
    and you leap through. As you arrive back in the bowl, the grommet drops
    into the box.

    Note that you must look in the chalice to see and thus be able to get
    the grommet and getting the chalice triggers the hippies entering. So
    you must look in the chalice before you get it to be able to do this in
    one bit.

    Panchax says they'll open a warp into Hydropolis, the fish planet's
    capital. The Fins have set up a meterological imbalance on the planet,
    causing water to evaporate. The fish scientists devised a project to
    save the world but the Fins sabotaged it. You must help them complete
    the project in the body of their leader, Dr Roach. You now see a large
    warp.

    Hypropolis

    "Go through large warp". You arrive in Roach's apartment. One move
    after your arrival, the wall behind your fishton glows. It's the
    principal's secretary to confirm that the principal is expecting you at
    10 o'clock.

    Examine watch; it shows the time as 9.02 and you will find out by
    playing that you must save Hydropolis before 4 o'clock.

    Examine fishton; it's a glorified sofa. "Look behind fishton"; you find
    a travel pass. Get it. Examine shelf; there's a fishofax on it. It
    contains a fisa card (use to buy things) and a tatty card (you need it
    for identification to get into the lab).
    Examine switch; Roach rewired it to control the lights in the rest of
    the apartments in the building instead of his own! It's currently on.

    When you go to leave, you find the door is a sliding design operated by
    a silver hand print next to it. "Put hand on print" to open the door.

    On the landing there are two prints. The silver one operates your door
    and the gold one the apartment opposite which belongs to Chubb. Don't
    close your door as you want to be burgled!

    Go to Paddlington, and to the underground; you show your pass as you go
    through. Wait, if necessary, till the train arrives then "get onto
    train".

    There are 8 stations on the underground. You can leave at Pickerel,
    Bettersea,  Opah University, Eelport, Museum and Paddlington but not at
    Barbellican or Angel.

    Leave the underground at Pickerel and go to the clothing shop. "Buy tie
    and glasses with fisa". Go to music shop, "buy plugs with fisa".
    Go to secondhand shop. You see a radio case there but when you try to
    buy it you're told that Ernest Chubb has already bought it and it will
    be delivered to him later in the day. Also in the shop is the fishton
    from your apartment! "Buy fishton with fisa". Steve, the owner, says he
    will get Rod to deliver it to your apartment.

    Go to hardware shop. Examine hyperdriver; it's needed to remove lok
    screws. "Buy hyperdriver, screwdriver and bag with fisa".

    Go to Opah university to the Principal's office by 10. She explains
    that a junior member of your staff was taken over by a parasite and
    sabotaged the project. You are the only one who can investigate. She is
    going to see the government and will be back tomorrow.

    Go to the library. Inside is a book and if you open it, it opens at
    random to a page showing a colour picture of an item you have
    previously seen in the game. If you "open book at last page" or "open
    book at page 321", you see a picture of the glass box. "Tear out page";
    you rip it out and are thrown out of the library but the page isn't
    taken from you.

    Go to end of corridor and "put tatty card in slot" to enter your lab.
    Go to the store room where the wall chart shows a lot of items are out
    of stock ie filter, photon bridge, focus wheel, tuned crystal, suitable
    case, shelf. The shelf is a red herring!

    Examine the protocopier. There's a slot in one side and a switch on the
    other. It's on and uses a lot of power. "Put page in slot"; the glass
    box materialises. Turn the protocopier off.

    Go to the restaurant and "buy meal with fisa". The waiter says they're
    too busy but he will sell you a takeaway sachet of plankton. "Buy
    sachet with fisa".

    If you try to go north from the foyer, a student says you need an ID
    card. Dr Salmon has it and he's probably getting drunk in town.

    Go to the pub and examine the drunk; it's Salmon. "Buy mask with fisa".
    Steve hands you a mask. Don't use it yourself, give it to the drunk. He
    inhales, thanks you and says he'd give a token of his gratitude but
    he's destitute. "Ask Salmon for card"; he gives it to you.

    "Buy mask with fisa" and give it to someone else. Do it again and Steve
    asks if you'd like to buy a cylinder? "Buy cylinder with fisa"; a drunk
    with his left arm in a sling lurches into you and knocks it over. Het
    says he'll get you another one and takes that one. Playfair shouts that
    it's one of the Fins as he runs off, and that the cylinder must be
    important. They have a fix on him and you must follow him. They will
    open a warp in Dr Roach's apartment.

    Go to Paddlington. The fishton has been delivered to your flat and the
    radio case is on the landing, having been delivered for Chubb. Get it,
    go in to the apartment; there's now a dark warp there. Drop everything
    and "go through warp".

    Panchax says it's a place where the Fins have twisted the dimensions
    into a labyrinth. The cylinder is in a place where the only exit is up
    and if you get into a room with no exits, you're stuck till they get
    you out which may be too late for Hydropolis.

    To find the cylinder, someone said to me to think of the puzzle as a
    Rubik's Cube. Get rid of the corners first and then the sides........

    You start in a room with random exits. There is really only one room
    (as you can test by dropping something) but the exits change each time.
    Every other location has an up exit.

    What you must do is move, removing exits as you do so, until your last
    move removes the final exit, and that move must be one that adds an up.
    Therefore, if you were in a room with exits N, W and NW, moving NW
    would remove N, NW and W and add an UP, so the final room would be the
    one with the cylinder in it. If the room had been N, NW, W and UP, NW
    would have left a room with no exits as the up is removed anyway.

    The easiest way I found is to start by removing all "double" exits, eg
    NW, NE. Then remove "single" ones eg N, S. If you find yourself in the
    position of eg N, NE, E then move NE but if it is N, NE, E, UP move any
    way BUT NE as that would remove the last exit. This works every time
    but there is probably an easier way!

    eg N, E, S, SW, NW. Move NW to give
      E, S, SW, W, U. Move SW to give
      E. Move E to give
      N, NE, SE, S, U. Move NE to give
      E, SE, S. Move SE to give
      UP and the cylinder.

    At the last location, get the cylinder and go up. You end up in the
    lounge. Before leaving, turn off the switch.

    Go to the university and "put new card in slot" . Go in, drop
    everything except the new card, bag and cylinder. "Put cylinder in
    bag". Go to tower. The trapdoor is above the usual level of the water
    and too high for you to get through.

    "Open cylinder", the bag fills with gas and you float through the
    trapdoor. You can see the roof, a photon bridge and some railings.
    "Drop bag", so you don't float off. Get bridge, "climb railings", you
    land back by the statue (+11). If you take too long, your gills dry
    out. If you just jump, you die by falling into shallow water.

    Go to Museum. Go to alarm room. If you go north, you trigger an alarm;
    do it twice and you get killed. "Open sachet"; it disperses in the
    water and you can see the beams. North. You are now in the crystal
    room. Get crystal and go back south.

    Go to Battersea. You must first go north and go on the tour. Examine
    the gauge; it shows the output of the station and on the tour you
    learned that Battersea is only a secondary power station used during
    peak periods and to power the underground. The door will only open when
    the turbines stop ie the power isn't being used. The switch controls
    the power output of the station and is on.

    By now you must have turned off the photocopier and the switch in your
    apartment and you only have a certain number of moves once the doors
    open as a guard will come and put the switch on again. "Pull switch";
    the door opens. Go in to the grille and examine it to see a filter.
    Examine the filter to see a screw on it. "Remove screw with
    screwdriver"; you take the filter.

    Go back to Opah and use the new card to enter the research wing.
    Examine the tuna; it is used to adjust the receiving frequency of a
    given crystal. It is open."Put crystal in tuna, close tuna"; there's a
    ringing sound which dies away after about 20 seconds. "Open tuna" and
    get crystal.

    Go to lab. "Sit down" at terminal. When prompted to log on, "login", it
    asks for your name "Roach" and password; this is in the fishofax
    written backwards as EM, so use "me".

    By using the command "project" and then "store", you are told that you
    need a stream regulator as the old one was stolen. This is made up of a
    filter, photon bridge, focus wheel, tuned crystal (there's an untuned
    one in the museum but they won't let us have it) and a case. From
    "read" and "equipment", you are told the stream regulator = ((a + c) +
    (b + d)) + e.
    If you "read", "note", it's from the principal saying people are
    wasting time playing games. From "games" you learn that Bertie Bream
    plays a lot of games (as the principal tells you or Bertie Bream to
    stop playing games and go back to work) and also there is a game called
    Shutdown which can only be accessed by Bream so it looks as though he
    is the saboteur.
    When you have finished, "logout".

    Go  to device.  It looks like a large tank filled  with multicoloured
    gravel. There's a stream accelerator in it which accelerates particles
    gathered by the main project machine. There's a lok screw on it (if you
    try to remove it with the hyperdriver, it will explode as it's been
    booby-trapped. Sir Playfair says you must identify the saboteur as he'd
    know how to disarm it.)

    "Join wheel to filter" to make a focus filter. "Join crystal to bridge"
    to make a crystal bridge. "Join filter to bridge"; you make the only
    crystal filter in Fishworld. "Put filter in case"; they fuse to make a
    stream regulator. Get regulator (If necessary, drop it and get it to
    get the points!)

    Go back to the pub and "ask Bream to go to disco". He says he'll meet
    you there at 3.30pm and leaves.

    Go to disco and wait till 3.30 when he arrives. Wear the glasses and
    ear plugs ready so the lights and noise don't affect you. If you go
    north, Bream says he can't go in as he hasn't got a tie. "Give tie to
    Bertie". You can now go north. You are protected by the glasses and
    plugs but he passes out. You see something leave his body. He says he's
    done something to the project, needs a shower and rushes off.

    Go back to device and "remove lok screw with hyperdriver"; before you
    can remove it, Bertie bangs on the door and says to stop. It's booby
    trapped, linked to the computer game, Shutdown. You must stop the
    program counting down. He thinks his password is gravel.

    Go and log onto the computer again, this time as "Bream" using the
    password "gravel". Go to "games" and select "shutdown". It gives a
    random word eg UACCX and says you have so many minutes to change it to
    WATER. The number of minutes is the amount of time left to 4pm.

    You must alter one cell at a time. If you add one to cell 1, that is
    all that happens but adding 1 to cell 2 adds 2 to cells 1 and 3.
    Similarly, adding 1 to cell 3 adds 3 to cells 2 and 4 and adding 1 to
    cell 5 adds 4 to cells 4 and 1.

    The easy way is to start from cell 5 and working backwards to 1, change
    the word to WASCO. That way, as you alter lower numbered cells, the
    higher number ones will be altered to the letter you want!

    When you succeed, "logout", the lok screw is now safe to touch.

    Go  to device,  "remove lok screw with  hyperdriver,  get accelerator,
    put regulator in device, attach regulator with lok screw"; it snaps
    into place.

    Success! You return to Mission HQ for debriefing and are awarded with 3
    months R&R with the goldfish of your choice!!

FUTURE WARS WALKTHRU
by Marci Rogers

General:  This game is so linear and so playable that everyone (and
his dog)  has not only finished it, but has written a walkthru (the
dog is still working on one). Therefore, I'll keep this brief to avoid
duplicating thousands--now that's a grim thought. There are really
only two things to bear in mind.  Timing is tricky in many sequences,
and the storyline is lethal.  In fact, if you're not careful, you will
spend more time dead than alive, so SAVE EARLY, SAVE OFTEN!!  Now, on
with the show:

Follow the instructions in the back of your manual for the opening
sequence.  You don't have a manual?  Then get your clues somewhere
else, Blackbeard!  After your boss is all wet, enter the office and
close (operate) the door behind you.  Use the key on the cupboards
until you find the one it fits, then read the number on the
typewriter.  Open the desk drawer and take the sheaf of paper, then
examine the wall map.  Use the red flag you found in the hole, and a
secret passage will open.  SAVE, then go down it.  The roof will fall
in (literally), so examine the control panel on the right and operate
More[n,Y,=]           each number separately using the combination you got froe
typewriter.  Whew, that drywall's close!  However, you are still alive
and can enter the lab, where you need to put the sheaf of paper in the
slot on the machine.  Now operate first the green and then the red
button.  Ignore the alarm, but don't dawdle, or you're dead!  Grab the
documents as soon as they print and head for the pillar of light.
It's actually a teleporter, and you are sent back to....

Medieval Times:  Right here, right now, SAVE, before you take even one
step.  You must stay on the green/brown squares only.  Walk carefully
west until you're within one square of the mosquitoes.  Easy, don't
rush.  Zap them with the insecticide and the rest of the going west is
easier.  Search the ground carefully just before you leave the screen.
Examine the gleam and take the pendant.  Keep walking into the lake
area.  Don't waste your time with the mound (it's a red herring), and
don't walk further west or you'll be mugged to death by monks; no, not
hugged, mugged.   Instead, go to the tree nearest the water and
examine the branch and the trunk base.  Take the rope and tie it to
the branch, then climb up and nap until a local villager decides to go
skinny dipping.  Climb down and take his pants and tunic.  Use them on
yourself.  There, you look positively serfish, so much so that the
monks will have vanished.  Now, that's what I call intuitive!

You can show the pendant to the guard, but he'll only tell you to come
More[n,Y,=]           back later.  Better not to bother, and simply walk up leo the
screen with the mini-forest.  Shake (operate) the tree and a coin will
fall from the robe.  You can't get the robe itself yet, so take the
coin and go back to the inn.  Give the coin to the innkeeper and
listen to the conversations after he brings your food.  As  soon as
you hear that the Lord's daughter is missing, go to the castle and
show the pendant to the guard.  You'll be taken to the Lord for an
automatic sequence, during which you will, of course, agree to rescue
the kidnapped lady.

When you leave the castle, you'll find that the guard has conveniently
dozed off (he doesn't work for your old boss) and you can grab his
spear.  Use it to get the monk's robe, which you can then use on
yourself.  Don't you just love costume parties.  Now go south from
the castle screen to the monastery.

Goodness, what big teeth that wolf has!  Fortunately, despite your
hood, you're not little Red, and a careful examination of the beast
will reveal his electric personality.  The first thought that will pop
into your head here is the correct one, but doing it is the problem.
Return to the lake and SAVE!  Now fill the plastic bag with water,
move as fast as you can back to the wolf, and use the FULL bag on the
it.  This requires careful timing and will probably take several
tries.  Heavens, it's just shocking how you treat animals!  After the
More[n,Y,=]           wolf's gone, cross to the monastery and SAVE.

Inside you find the monks of the renowned Order of the Clockwise
Motion.  Better worship as they do, or you'll be their first
sacrifice.  Start by circling left to open the door on the left room.
Enter and approach the monk near the cup, who will send you to Father
Superior.  Exit and CIRCLE right to the far right door, where you meet
"Father Superior".  Rasputin had nothing on this fake, but go when he
sends you to get him some wine.  The monk in the first room is now
gone, so pick up the cup.   Circle around to the door in the back
wall, which is the wine cellar.  Open it, and go down the stairs where
you should examine the barrels until you find a full one.  Operate it
to fill the cup and return to "Father".  He'll chew you out for
getting the wrong thing, but he'll drink it anyway and pass out.
Search him, get the remote control, and use it on the chest below the
library shelves.  Take the magnetic card that's inside, exit, and
circle back to the wine cellar.  Climb the ladder, examine the
barrels, and then use the remote control on the empty one.  Voila!
Another secret passage.  Enter it.

You're in another lab, and look at that beautiful girl!
Unfortunately, her make-up is absolutely plastic.   Examine her area
carefully and take the gas capsule on the floor, then examine the
console.  Use the magnetic card, and she'll be free not only to look
More[n,Y,=]           at you, but to take you out of there and into another autic
sequence.  Don't relax too much.  Humanity is faced with a grim future
and you're about to be part of it.  Next stop....

4135 A.D.:  You've just dropped into a future wasteland, and it looks
as if Lo'Ann stood you up.  You're on your own in the rubble, so
examine it closely, especially in the lower right until you find the
empty blowtorch.  Pick that up and proceed right to where you'll find
more rubble, hiding a box of fuses and a manhole in the center.  Open
the manhole and go down.  Welcome to the sewers, where you will not
find the ghost of Jean Valjean, or even the Phantom of the Opera, but
you will encounter a gas tap about three screens down.  Use the
blowtorch with it and keep walking.  This isn't a maze; just follow
the paths and you'll do fine.  Quite soon you run into a mutant
octopus threatening a mother and child.  SAVE before you get close and
then make it your latest flame.  Mom will be so grateful that she'll
open up an exit, which beats the heck out of candy and flowers at this
point.  Take it.

Naturally, your exit will seal up the minute you use it and leave you
before a sealed door.  Never fear; your spear is here.  Use it on the
camera lens to enter the subway station.  Examine the newspaper
machine and the coin collector.  Use the coin you find there in the
coin slot.  Gee, it works just like a real vending machine, so you
More[n,Y,=]           will have to repeat the process.  Don't worry if you misur train
while all this is going on.  There are at least two, and they all go
to the same place.  Take the newspaper and board the car to the air
terminal.  This is a depressing place for someone as broke as you are.
The attendant wants money and the security guard isn't about to move.

Might as well go down to the loo, where the commodes are equally
greedy and the fuses are exposed.  Shame on them, but at least you get
the chance to examine them and replace the ones that are burned out.

When you return to the lobby, you find that the guard has found
something to distract him.  The attendant is still demanding, but you
can get past her if you notice how vain she is.  In fact, she powders
her nose every other minute.  Just stand close to the guard and wait
until she looks in the mirror.  Now use the escalator and board the
plane for a comfortable ride--that is, if you don't mind kidnappings.

The Crughons will take over your plane only a few minutes after you
leave.  This is automatic, so just wait until you wake up in the cell.
Luckily, the Crughons are related to the aliens in Zak McKracken
through generations of inbreeding, and they left you with everything
in your inventory.  Use the key on the grate, then SAVE.  Toss the gas
capsule into the opening and QUICKLY cover it with the newspaper.
Wait until your cell door opens, and then go out.  Your captors are
More[n,Y,=]           all dead, and, better yet, you're being rescued by humanMaybe not
so good, since they arrest you as a spy, and order your execution,
without even giving you a chance to save.

In true adventure style, you're gasping your last when Lo'Ann shows up
with the reprieve.  Looks like she didn't stand you up after all, and
you get to recover during another automatic sequence which details the
Crughons' dastardly plan.  Lo'Ann gets a bit carried away with all
this and resolves to stop them single-handedly.  You're not about to
let her do it, since you're the hero, and, besides, she's the first
decent date you've had in months.  So you volunteer to accompany her,
and it's off to....

Dinosaur Days:  This time the transfer goes well, at least as well as
you could expect, and you only have to navigate an easy outcropping to
reach Lo'Ann.  Take the weapon she gives you, and then SAVE THE GAME.
You are about to go left into one of the obligatory arcade sequences
which plague recent games.  We are all suffering from the current
belief among programmers and distributors that the only people playing
computer adventures are teenage boys.  Obviously, they never read
polls or surveys, and the majority of adventurers are left grinding
their teeth while yet another Amiga program attempts to present a
great computer as a Nintendo.  This trend is frustrating, infuriating,
and even insulting, but we're stuck--so SAVE.  The field below you
More[n,Y,=]           will be covered with Crughons who will start blasting moarily, and
they will regenerate infinitely until you blast their commander off
his floating platform.  After that, you will simply have to clear out
the current bunch.  I use simply as a comparative term, since most
folks who have worked their way through this part are now muttering to
themselves about murders in Paris.  (Individually, I didn't have that
much trouble, but I was a real joystick jockey as a teen, and I was
using a Golden Image mouse.  This little device is basically a graphic
artist's tool, and thus is very fast and VERY accurate.  I'm not
saying that it made the difference--no "sponsor's plugs", but I was
through in three tries.  The next lowest number I've heard is twenty-
two, with more than thirty being average!)  So prepare; you have been
warned.

After this ordeal is finally over, the last Crughon will, with his
last breath, shoot Lo'Ann.  You can't prevent this, although you can
add a parting shot of revenge if you desire.  Naturally, you need to
help Lo'Ann immediately, so examine her.  She's still alive, so search
her again, and again.  Come on, you know you've wanted to do this.
The first search will equip you with an invisibility pill, and the
second will turn up Lo'Ann's pendant, which you can use to send her
back to the future (kind of a catchy title) for proper treatment.  You
need to go down to the Crughon ship.

More[n,Y,=]           When you do, you'll find a dead Crughon by the ramp.  Se him,
which won't be as much fun, but will give you a magnetic card.  Now
enter the ship and go to the cockpit.  Use your card in the card
reader and then open the cryocase in front.  Take the garment and put
it over the video camera.  Move yourself to the case, SAVE in
preparation for the next stage, then lie down.  An automatic sequence
will take you to....

Crughon Headquarters:  Timing is absolutely vital in these next scenes
and you will likely take several tries to succeed.  As soon as the
case opens, go to the back wall by the card reader.  Ready the
invisibility pill, but wait until the door is almost completely open
on the Crughon guards before using it.  Don't move until the second
guard clears you, then go down the ramp.  Don't head for the door.
It's a dummy to trick you.  Instead, go carefully forward past the
guard and tuck in behind the crates on the left.  There is just barely
time to make it, and you can't bump a Crughon, but it CAN be done.
Have patience.

Once you're safely hidden, examine the crates until you find the one
you can open.  Hide in it, and you'll be taken to the cargo room.  As
soon as you emerge from the crate, Lo'Ann's pendant will chat you up
and tell you the only way to defeat the Crughons.  This involves
hacking into the master computer, but, worse than that, it also
More[n,Y,=]           involves another of those nasty little arcade sequences.is one
isn't as hard, but it's TIMED, so SAVE before you go out the door
into....

Chutes & Ladders:  Actually, it ought to be "shoot the ladders",
because that's all there are, and this is NOT a fun game for children,
or adults.  I'll try to talk you through it as follows:  When you are
told to go "Right 1", you should actually leave the screen in that
direction.  However, a simple "right" means to remain in the same
frame.  The same will hold true for directions to the left, as the up
and down directions are not confusing.  So, here goes:

Right 1, down, right 1, down, right and down, left 1, down, right 1,
down, right and down.  Left 1, down, down, left 1, down, down, down,
down, right 1, up, up, right 1, up, up, up, then right and down, down,
down, down, down.  Left 1, down, right 1, down, left 2, down, right 1,
and head into the computer room.

Go as quickly as you can to the console in the upper left and use your
card in the console.  The pendant will take over from there, and you
will have saved humanity.  That's nice, but it doesn't do much for
you.  In order to preserve your piece of humanity, you must make it to
the hangar before time runs out.  If your time down was close to three
minutes (my very best time after many runs was 2:35), save the game.
More[n,Y,=]           The hangar is not all the way back up.  Aren't you glad have this
walkthru and don't have to find that out the same way as the idiot who
wrote it?

To the hangar, it's back out and left 1, up, right 2, up, left 1, up,
right 1, up, up, up, up, up.  Left and down, down, down, left 1, down,
down, left 1, up, up, up, up, right 1, up, left 1, up, and right into
the door marked with the arrows.  And now....

WINDOW WASHERS IN SPACE!!

Congratulations.  You get the girl, a better job, and hero status,
while Future Wars gets yet another walkthru.  Au revoir.

 FUTURE WARS
   Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 This game is entirely mouse driven. Be aware that some of the objects you nee
d
to use or manipulate are very small. By careful use of the EXAMINE command and
the cursor, you should be able to find everything. Checking over the whole
screen before you try anything (if time permits) is generally a good idea, and
EXAMINE "X" may lead to some clues as to the proper course of action. Proper
positioning may also be a problem, and you may have to experiment with moving
your character before you can achieve the desired result. The game is wholly
linear, and you must do things in the proper order. Save your game _often_.

 You begin as a humble window washer, clumsy and browbeaten. After you knock
over your bucket and get chewed out by the boss, TAKE the bucket. EXAMINE the
scaffold, move to the far left of the scaffold, and OPERATE the "up" arrow. When
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-1949

you stop, OPERATE the window that's ajar, and go inside the building.

 In the waiting room, EXAMINE the wastebasket and TAKE the plastic bag. If you
move to the right and EXAMINE the rug, you will notice a small lump under the
rug. Move to the far right lower corner and OPERATE the rug. This reveals a
small key, which you will take. Go into the bathroom, and OPERATE the cupboard.
TAKE the can of insecticide. OPERATE the WC door, and TAKE the small red flag on
the floor inside (it's very tiny). Finally, USE the bucket with the sink, and
get ready to play a really corny practical joke.

 Return to the waiting room and USE the full bucket on the door in the back
wall, then go to the door on the right wall and OPERATE it. In the ensuing
confusion you can go through the door into the office next door. OPERATE the
door again to close it. USE the key on the second cupboard from the left and
you'll find a typewriter. EXAMINE it. There is a number on the ribbon which you
should write down. OPERATE the desk drawer and TAKE the sheaf of paper inside.
Now, EXAMINE the map. A small inset map of Europe appears, and careful scrutiny
should reveal a small hole. USE the little flag with the hole, and the whole
wall recedes, revealing a secret passage. SAVE the game at this point because
the timing can be tricky in this next sequence.
 !CompuServe TEG-1951


 Go into the passage. The ceiling will start coming down at you. Quickly,
EXAMINE the number pad to the right of the door, then OPERATE the five digits
which make up the number you saw on the typewriter ribbon. The ceiling will stop
and the door will open, and you can go through and to your right into the
laboratory. There is a machine with two buttons and a big slot. USE the sheaf of
paper in the slot, then OPERATE the green button and the red button in that
order. TAKE the documents the machine spits out, and move to the white circle to
the right.

 You will disappear and reappear in a swamp in days of old. Save the game here.
If you move off the green/brown land areas, you will sink into the muck and
disappear. When you get close to the swarm of mosquitoes, USE the insecticide on
them, and proceed to the left. Just before you leave the screen, you will notice
something gleaming in the dirt. EXAMINE it, and you will find a pendant which
you will take. Go off to the left.

 You are now in a wooded area by a lake. Work your way out of the bushes, and
EXAMINE the foot of a tree by the lake. You will find a rope. If you proceed off
the screen to the left, you will be killed by fanatic "monks" who take you for a
 !CompuServe TEG-1953

spy, so you had better get a change of clothes. USE the rope on the overhanging
branch of the same tree, and you will be perched up there. Some unsuspecting
soul will eventually come by and go skinny dipping in the lake. Descend from the
tree and TAKE his tunic and slacks, then USE them on yourself. Now, when you go
off screen to the left, the monks will not even be there. Go figure it. This
screen has an Inn and the entrance to a castle. Go up to the guard and SPEAK to
him. Then USE the pendant on the guard. He'll tell you to come back later.

 Go off the screen to the left behind the castle and you'll be in a wooded glen
where a monk's robe is hanging from a branch. You can't reach it, so OPERATE the
tree to shake it, and while the robe won't fall, a coin will drop out of the
pocket. TAKE it and return to the Inn. OPERATE the door and go inside. USE the
coin with the innkeeper, and he'll show you to a seat. You'll overhear snatches
of conversation from the other customers. It seems the Master's daughter is
missing. Leave the Inn and return to the guard. USE the pendant on him one more
time and he'll let you in to meet the Master. The Master will ask you to rescue
his daughter, the lovely Lana. Of course, you hasten to comply.

 As you leave the castle, you will find the guard asleep. (So hard to get good
help these days!) TAKE his lance, then go to the wooded glen; after much trial
 !CompuServe TEG-1956

and error, you'll find the right spot in which to stand. Now, USE the lance on
the monk's robe (you will immediately put it on). Return to the castle and go
off the screen at the bottom.

 MONASTERY

 You will be near the monastery, the only entrance to which is guarded by what
seems to be a ferocious wolf. However, careful cursor watchers will notice a
small metallic glint under the wolf that indicates this is a creature of
technology, not nature. This is one of my favorite bits. Save the game, go back
to the lake, and USE the plastic bag with the lake. Hurry back to the wolf, and
when you get close enough, USE the full bag on the wolf. He blows up _real_
good! You can now go to the monastery door and OPERATE it. This is another good
point at which to save the game.

 The central hall of the monastery features three doors (right, back and left),
and those famous circling monks you've heard so much about. They continue to
move in a clockwise fashion around the room, staying close to the edges of the
floor. This is their ritual. Follow it closely, because you deviate from it at
your own peril.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1957


 First go to the door on the left and OPERATE it. You will find a room with two
stained-glass windows and a monk standing next to a cup. As you approach him, he
will tell you to alert the Father Superior that something is ready. (The
skorzuum? It's Greek to you!) Leave and proceed clockwise to the door on the
right. OPERATE it and go in. You will find the Father Superior who will ask you
for a cup of something else you won't recognize.

 Go back to the first room, TAKE the cup, then proceed clockwise to the door on
the back wall, and OPERATE it. Go downstairs and up the ladder. OPERATE the
barrels until you find one that's full, then USE the cup with the barrel. Go
back upstairs and clockwise to the Father Superior. You'll give him the cup, and
he will immediately pass out. EXAMINE his body, and you'll find a remote
control. TAKE it, then USE it on the "piece of furniture" underneath the
library. This will open, and a magnetic card will be revealed. TAKE it, leave
the room, and go clockwise to the wine cellar again. Go up the ladder, then USE
the remote control on the barrels until you find one that opens. Go through it.

 THE PRINCESS

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1959

 You'll be in another lab room. In it you'll find a beautiful princess encased
in a transparent cylinder, and a computer console floating in mid-air. In your
excitement over finding the princess, don't neglect to TAKE the gas capsule on
the floor by her cylinder. EXAMINE the console, then USE the card with the
console. This will free the princess, and you can relax for a bit while you have
some things explained to you. You'll be taken back to the castle and told that
the princess is really Lo'ann from the far future. She and her father are agents
of the Earth Government trying to stop the Crughons from taking over the earth.
She will recruit you and take you -- along with those all-important but nearly
forgotten documents -- back to her home in the year 4135 A.D.

 FUTURE WARS
   Part 2

 4135 A.D.

 You materialize in the wasteland (oops, wrong game!) that is the Earth of the
future, but Lo'ann is missing. You must proceed alone. Everywhere you look
there's nothing but rubble and ruins. If you EXAMINE some rubble to the right,
however, you will find a half-buried empty pocket blowtorch. Go off to the
right, and TAKE the box of fuses half-buried there. In the center of the screen
is another pile of rubble to EXAMINE. There, fully buried this time, is a
manhole cover. OPERATE it and descend to the sewers below.

 Thankfully, this is not a maze. Keep a close watch on the thin pipes along the
wall. Eventually, you will come to a small tap. USE the empty blowtorch with the
tap and it will fill with gas. This comes in handy almost immediately, when you
have to rescue a mother and child from a horrible mutant sewer beast. USE the

CompuServe TEG-1963

blowtorch on the monster (keeping a safe distance), and the mother -- in
gratitude -- will materialize another exit for you leading to the surface. Go
up.

 You are now in front of a subway system whose automatic doors seem jammed.
Simply USE the lance on the video camera above to doors, and you will be
admitted. Save the game here. On the lower left-hand side of the screen is a
newspaper machine. Carefully EXAMINE it to see a small money slot and a small
coin collector. EXAMINE the coin collector and you'll find a coin, you lucky
dog! USE the coin in the slot, and...um...nothing happens. Despair not. EXAMINE
the coin collector again, and the coin will be back. USE it in the slot again,
and this time you are rewarded with a newspaper. If you do this quickly enough,
you won't miss your train. Board it, sit back, and relax for a second.

 You will be deposited in an air terminal. A bored security guard will prevent
you from going up to the plane, so you must distract him. Go down the stairs at
the bottom of the screen, and EXAMINE the fuse box and fuses on the left. USE
your fuses with the fuses in the box, replacing the burnt out middle one, then
save the game. Go back upstairs. The guard is now watching television, and if
you move just behind him, you can sneak up to the escalator to the plane. This
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1966

may take more than one try. On the plane, you will be taken captive by the
Crughons (there is no way to avoid this at all), and wind up in a tiny cell.

 Crughons are among the dumbest race in the galaxy because they don't take any
of your inventory (and how you can continue to conceal a lance on your person is
beyond me). Timing here is a bit dicey, so save again. USE your key on the air
vent to remove the grate, then USE the gas canister on the vent, and finally USE
the newspaper on the vent to keep the gas from blowing back in your face. If
done correctly, you will have killed all your Crughon captors, and the cell door
will open. You can go into the next room, but before you can do anything much
there, Earth command will rescue you, and take you before the Council, where you
will be sentenced to death as a Crughon spy. What?

 FUTURE WARS
   Part 3

 PREHISTORY AND ENDGAME

 When last we saw our intrepid window washer cum planetary savior, he was about
to be executed as a Crughon spy. Fortunately, Lo'ann shows up in the nick of
time to save him. And with the help of the documents (remember the documents?)
you brought back, uh, forward, oh, never mind. Anyway, they've been decoded, and
the Crughon plot to destroy Earth's defenses by planting a bomb in the past
before the defenses are built has been revealed. One time bomb has already gone
off. You helped Lo'ann foil the plot in medieval land where you first met. Now,
the council needs a volunteer to accompany Lo'ann to the distant past, and to
foil the third and last sabotage scheme.

 Three guesses who volunteers.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1970

 You are sent back to the dawn of creation (or thereabouts), and end up in a
cave. Head down to Lo'ann, and she will give you an air pistol. Follow her to
the left, then save the game. The entire plain below you is swarming with
Crughons! Your only hope is to wipe them out in one real nasty arcade sequence
which will have the pure strategists in the bleachers screaming for the
programmers' blood.

 I, upon seeing the shape of things to come, immediately handed control of the
mouse to my fourteen year old son, who has much more practice in such matters.
To kill the Crughons, simply position the cursor over the tiny scurrying
figures, and hit the fire button on your mouse. Be especially quick to blast the
ones surrounded with red boxes marked DANGER, because those are firing back at
you, and they are not firing to wound.

 After the first wave, the remaining horde will converge towards the center.
Pick off those on both the left and right sides to keep them from the center,
and they won't become DANGERs. At some point, the Crughon commander will come
out on a floating platform. Be sure to get him quickly, too. This may take more
than one try; it took my son, Deadshot, four tries. Learn patience and
persevere.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1972


 After all the Crughons are blasted, one will -- with his dying breath -- shoot
Lo'ann. EXAMINE her once to find she is still alive. EXAMINE her twice and you
will find an invisibility pill. EXAMINE her three times and you will find her
pendant, which you can USE on her to send her back to the future, where she can
be healed. You will then proceed alone to the Crughon spaceship.

 By the ramp is a dead Crughon. EXAMINE him and find a magnetic card. Then, go
up the ramp to the cockpit/bridge. USE the card in the card reader on the back
wall, then OPERATE the suspended animation case in the foreground. The lid will
raise. TAKE the garment, and USE the garment on the video camera, protecting
yourself from prying eyes. Click on the case a few times and you will lie down.
OPERATE the case, and the lid will come down. While you're in suspended
animation, the ship will return to the Crughon base. Save your game _before_ it
lands in the hangar!

 Timing is everything in the next section, and the odds are you'll have to try
this more than once in order to succeed. When the ship lands, you'll wake up.
Immediately move to the rear wall of the cabin. As the door opens, about halfway
through its cycle, USE the invisibility pill on yourself. Two guards will enter.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-1975

As soon as the second guard is inside, slip out the door. You will automatically
go down the ramp. Move just past the guard at the foot of the ramp, go towards
the bottom of the screen, and go left behind the boxes. If you time everything
right, you will be hidden by the boxes when the pill wears off. If you make even
one mistake, you're doomed as doomed can be, and must restore.

 EXAMINE and OPERATE the big box at the lower left, and you will find it to be a
perfect hiding place. You will be taken to a storage room. Your pendant is a
telepathic interface, which will tell you that the only way you can thwart the
Crughons is to reprogram the master computer. Easy, right? There are only three
problems: (1) you are a window washer, not a programmer; (2) you don't know
where the computer is; and (3) you have only six minutes of real time to
reprogram the computer and escape from the ship. Actually, problems (1) and (2)
are minor. Problem (3) throws two of your worst nightmares at you: a maze AND an
arcade sequence. Save before you take another step if you value your sanity.

 When you go through the storage compartment door, you will find yourself in a
corridor. In addition to ladders (which are everywhere), there are also holes
blasted in the floor in inconvenient locations. This maze comprises 18 screens,
each screen showing two levels of corridors, three screens across and eight
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9032

screens down. The computer room is on the lowest level in the middle screen. I
found the best way to map the maze was to click both mouse buttons (as if I were
going to save the game) as soon as entered a new screen. That paused the clock's
countdown while I sketched each block. This is not difficult to map, thank
goodness, but the route to the bottom is a tad circuitous, to say the least. On
top of that, the mouse interface is not the most user-friendly, and I found
there were times I had to click wildly in order to get the stupid hero to go up
or down a ladder. Try to maintain an even strain throughout this sequence.
Practice until you can get from the top to the bottom in under three minutes. My
best time was 2:40.

 When you get to the computer room, move quickly as you can to the console on
the left. USE the magnetic card in the console and the rest will take care of
itself. You've saved the day, so now you can save yourself and get off this ship
before the fleet leaves without you. The escape door, marked with several
prominent arrows, is located on the top corridor on the left-most of the three
screens on the fourth level from the top. With a little practice, you should get
there in plenty of time. Once you do, the rest of the game is automatic.
Congrats!

Walkthrough for GOBLIINS 2                   Henning Koch
==========================                   koch_h@lifra.lif.de

Level 1 (Village, Well, Giant)
------------------------------
First Fingus has to steal the bottle, while Winkle tries to steal
the sausage. At the well Fingus has to push the statue. While the
statue is spiting water, Winkle has to fill the bottle. Then
Winkle has to scare off the frog with the bottle. Take the stone.
With the stone Winkle must use the mechanism. Let Fingus pull down
the mechanism, while Winkle goes up. After Fingus has spoken with
the magician, let Winkle jump into the chimney. Now the door is
open. In the house Winkle has to kick the tail. While the mouth is
open, Fingus has to take the matches. Now you must use the bottle
and the matches on the kettle (wait). Then one of them has to blow
out the fire. Take the key, put it into the clock, turn the key
and while the bird comes out, Winkle has to throw the stone on the
bird. With the key you can open the door to the wine-cellar. Take
the wine. In the village give the poured flower to the old man
with the sausage. Now you must put Winkle on the mat in front of
the house and Fingus has to push the button. From the top of the
house Winkle can take the sausage. In the level with the giant
Winkle has to grab the hen. While he holds the hen, Fingus must
use the sausage on the hen's head. Take the egg. While Fingus is
putting the sausage through the hole in front of the dog, Winkle
goes past the dog and goes through the tree. Then both Goblins go
back through the hole in the wall. After one of them fire the
wood, Fingus has to put the egg into the fire. Then wake up the
giant and give the sausage and the wine to him. Now you can go
into the next level. 

Level 2 (Ditch, Kael, Vivalzart, Musicroom, Tom)
------------------------------------------------
Fingus has to take a bomb out of the tower. While he holds it,
Winkle fires it with the matches. Then Winkle takes a bomb and
fires it while Fingus holds it. After that Fingus takes a bomb
again and fires it while Winkle holds it. Then one of them goes on
the carpet and speaks with the magician. In the level with Kael
Winkle has to use the bottle on the nymph. After Winkle gives the
bottle to Kael and stands on his branches, put Fingus on the rock
under the branches. And now they have a flower. One of them has to
put the flower in the stone and you get honey. Winkle opens the
stone and Fingus has to jump on the bee. He gives the honey to the
nymph and takes the mushroom which the nymph shows you. Let Winkle
knock on the door and Fingus shows the mushroom to Vivalzart. In
the house Winkle has to take a worm. Put Fingus on the plate under
the vulture. Winkle must push the button and while Fingus is
hanging on the meat, Winkle has to throw the worm to the vulture.
Give the meat to the piranha and take the bone. Then Winkle has to
put the mushroom in the machine and Fingus must push the button.
After that Fingus goes on the dustbin and Winkle gives the bone to
Vivalzart. Then take the wash-clip. Now both must fill the bottle
and then they are at the musicroom. Winkle has to grab through the
floodlight and put the blowstick through the catch- sock. Then he
has a catch-net. Now Fingus has to jump on the feather. And while
he is jumping, he has to grab through the floodlight. Now both
have to jump on the feather (together). Then Winkle has to clamp
the pipe with the wash-clip. Fingus goes to the guitar player
through the hole on the left side. Winkle jumps into the hole on
the right side and catches the guitar player's note with the net.
Winkle blows the saxophon player with the pump. Then Fingus has to
go through the hole and catches the mosquito. Now Fingus has to
blow the saxophon player and Winkle catches the note. Now Winkle
has to put the mosquito through the floodlight and Fingus catches
the last note. Now they are in the level with Tom. Winkle has to
throw the ball with the stone. Now he has to go into the house 
with the boy. While Winkle goes in, Fingus has to go into the
house on the top. Now Fingus gives the ball to the
basketballplayer. While the ball is jumping on the basket, Winkle
has to jump into the basket. After you spoke with the mayor and
Tom, Winkle has to throw the melody into the house at the bottom.
Then speak with Tom. Take the sand-clock and use it on the ditch.
Go through the hole and you're in the next level. 

Level 3 (Guards, Blacksmith, Well)
----------------------------------
In the level with the guards Winkle has to wake up Krusty. While
the mouth of one guard on the right side is open, Fingus has to
grab the bubble gum. One of them puts the bubble gum into the
keyhole. Winkle has to put the mayonnaise under the mask on the
floor. Then Fingus goes above the board on the top of the screen
and jumps on the mayonnaise. While the guard is deverted Winkle
has to grab the rapier. Give the rapier and the stamp to the
blacksmith. Then Winkle has to use the stool on Oto. Fingus
quickly has to jump on the lance. After Fingus jumps on the
bellow, he goes to the blacksmith and takes the key and the anvil.
While Winkle gives the mayonnaise to the gnome on the right side,
Fingus takes a piece of meat with the stool. In the level with
the guards Winkle gives the meat to the gnome with the teeth. Then
one goblin opens the cupboard. Take a diving suit with each
goblin. In the level with the well the well goes into the tunnel.
Then he lifts the axe. Now Fingus pushes the button at the axe.
Fingus goes into the tunnel. And while the mouth is moving, Winkle
goes into the door. Now Fingus quickly goes on the stool and ties
the rope on Schwarzy. Then Winkle shocks Schwarzy with the teeth
and gives the anvil to him. Finnaly both goblins put on their
diving suit and go into the well. Now you can swim into the next
level. 

Level 4 (Wreck, Mermaid)
------------------------
Fingus has to push the light-fire. Then Winkle has to catch the
lamp-fish. Now Winkle puts the lamp-fish to the ??? on the right
side. In the level with the blind mermaid Fingus slips through the
hole besides the exit. While Winkle is throwing the shell, Fingus
catches it. Now Fingus climbs on the sea-horse with the stool.
Then he grabs into the cave and while the glove appears, Winkle
throws the shell from the place where Fingus catched the shell.
Now Winkle grabs the shell and takes a glove and a starfish. Then
Fingus puts the glove above the gel-monster, takes the bottle and
gives the parchment to the octopus. Now Winkle takes the bottle,
takes the pearl and gives it to the mermaid. Then he takes the
glove and goes back to the wreck. There Winkle calls the moray
per light-fire. Now put Fingus on the big shell. When Winkle uses
the control wheel, Fingus will catapult up. While Winkle throws
the starfish on the chest, Fingus has to touch the statue and
takes the rapier. Now Winkle goes through the door and Fingus
throws the rapier against the skull. He takes the diamond, gives
it to the mermaid and goes to the exit (don't forget the stool).
Now you are in the next level. 

Level 5 Stock Chamber, Throne Room, Armament Chamber)
-----------------------------------------------------
In the stock chamber Fingus has to touch the sword-fish. Now
Fingus lifts the cover of the pot and Winkle puts the salt into
the pot. Take the file out of the three pots. Then Winkle goes to
the rope above the cook. While Fingus takes the rope on the other
side, Winkle pulls on the rope. Fingus has to file the chain of
the cage and takes a nail. Winkle has to put the salt on the meat
balls, while Oumkapok takes up the cook. Winkle has to put the
nail on the box. Now Fingus must pour the friend- drink above the
flying meat ball and Oumkapok is now friendly. Then you must go to
the throne room. Fingus takes the pepper. Winkle holds his hands
on the parapet and Fingus goes on them. Now Fingus pushes the
button and Winkle goes through the door on the right side. Fingus
goes to the tongue and pulls it while Winkle is in the ear. Now
Winkle pulls the tongue while Fingus is in the ear. Then Fingus
grabs in the hole on the right side with the glove while Glotziok
is deverted from Winkle whilst he puts his head through the
opening on the right side. You must put the cockroach in front of
the hole on the right side and pour friend-drink on it. Now you
let a cockroach come again, take the cockroach and go to the
armament chamber. At the armament Fingus jumps per stone-pressure
in front of the window. He opens the visor and puts the crown on
the helmet. Then you take a feather from the helmet and put this
feather in the red paint at the painter, put the cockroach in
front of the hole, pour the friend-drink above it, use the red
feather on it and put pepper on it. The fool is free now and can
reduce the both goblins. Now you are in the next level. 

Level 6 (Board)
---------------
At the map Winkle takes the point of the knife and Fingus takes
the grasp. You must repeat this process some times. Now take the
reader-sign. Winkle has to lever the eye with the match and the
fool kicks the eye. Put the reader-sign in the candle and hold the
fragment into the light-ray. You must put the wax into the seal
and take the imprint. You must put this imprint into the stamp.
Put the seed on the Village on the map, slide down the beanpole
and you are in the next level. 

Level 7 (Kael, Dreamland, Mountain)
-----------------------------------
Winkle climbs through the hole and takes a bean. He gives this
bean to the mole. While the mole is pulling the bean, Fingus takes
the moles' cap. Now Winkle takes with the match an apple from the
tree. While the apple is jumping, Fingus catches it with the cap.
Winkle puts the apple in the hole. Finally both goblins must eat a
mushroom. In the dreamland Fingus touches the cone and while the
ball is jumping, Winkle goes on the star. Winkle puts the ball on
the cover and stay with it there. Now Fingus has to stand on the
plate (safety-pin). You take a ball again, put it on the cover and
put Fingus on the catapult. Fingus jumps on the plate again and
Winkle is up. There Winkle has to push the aerial, put himself on
the bubble and when he lands on the cover, Fingus must jump on the
plate (safety-pin). Now you put Winkle up again. Put Fingus on the
plate in front of the bubble-man and Winkle jumps on the topmost
plate. Now Fingus is up, too. Fingus pushes the button. And while
the fool is catched in the bubble-ring, Winkle pushes the aerial.
Now you must prick the bubble with the safety-pin and they are in
the level with the beanpole again. Put the fool on the catapult.
While Fingus pushes the button (then the key comes), Winkle
catapults the fool to the key (try it, until a bird comes). Now
you can go to the mountains. While Fingus lifts the stone, Winkle
takes it. Now Fingus takes the stone, which Winkle lift to him.
Then put Winkle on the head of the lion and let Fingus throw the
stone. Winkle pushes down the head. You must lift the stone again,
but this time only to the second floor. Then Winkle goes on the
head of the lion again and Fingus throws the stone. Fingus goes on
the head of the lion and Winkle let fall the head. Now you let
jump Fingus on the !!! until Winkle can reach the rock. Winkle
makes a bridge between the rocks. Fingus goes above the bridge,
file the bird out of his cage, takes the key and the fool, goes 
into the screen with the beanpole, unlocks the door and goes into
the next level. 

Level 8 (Tazaar)
----------------
Give the magic water to the fool. Winkle has to paint with the
pencil on the portrait and a boomerang comes fly, which Winkle can
take from the arm-chair. Winkle pours water on Tazaar with the cup
and Fingus takes the teeth-poke with the boomerang. Now Winkle has
to paint on the board with the pencil three times. Winkle opens
the skeleton with the teeth-poke and makes the sponge wet in the
puddle. Winkle blows the whistle and Fingus holds the sponge into
the smoke. Now you must go through the door and you are in the
next level. 

Level 9 (Death-Empire)
----------------------
There Winkle goes to the !!! and Fingus on the eye. While the
crocodile wants to snatch the mouse which Fingus holds to it, put
Winkle on the head. He will catapult up, throws the boomerang
against the teeth and quickly goes the !!!. Winkle puts the sponge
on the rock. Now put the fool on the eye and catapult him to the
sponge. While the water runs out, Fingus quickly must paint a door
on the rock and Winkle quickly must open the door. Go out of the
door and you can enjoy the Happy-End.

At logon type: - TITLE (cr) - COVER (cr, this is special)
               - DEMO PAM (cr, gives unlimited MRU's)
               - DEMO (cr) - WAMI (cr) - DOME (cr) - GOMES (cr)

- HACKER 2 - Skip ID: Enter 00987 as Logon ID number to eliminate panel control
  identification sequence and begin the game immediately on the MFSM
- Unlimited MRUs: Enter DEMO PAM as logon code
- Logon codes: Valid game codes include TITLE, COVER, DEMO, WAMI, DOME, GOMES

At logon type one of these: "00987" | "COVER" / "TITLE" | "WAMI" / "PAM"

During play enter one of these: "RED7"- | "WHITE6" / "BLUE1" | "WHITE50"
NOTE: They might have to be lower case like HACKER II.

Logon codes: Title, Cover, Demo, Demo Pam, Wami, Dome, Gomes
Logon I.D. number is 00987, with this number you can start directly on MFSM.

It  seems  easy enough, once you penetrate  the  security. Just move the MRUs
from  room  to room. Locate the combinations  to the safe. Find the safe. And
remove  the  documents.  But  it's not  that  easy.  In  fact, it's downright
dangerous. Guard patrols. And something called the ...The Annihilator.

  Instead  you can do your spying from home, using a Multi-Function Switching
Matrix  - that could take a little time  to install, so here's one the secret
service  prepared  for  you earlier! It's  a  sort  of multi-purpose terminal
gizmo, which lets you use the base's security cameras for your own ends.

As  well  as choosing the view on  the four screens of this voyeur's delight,
you can tap into the automatic cameras themselves, to get an idea of what the
KGB  is watching. Furthermore, the MFSM contains a radar map, which tells you
where you are. But the device's most important function is to let you control
one  of three Mobile Remote Units, in your search for the safe containing the
papers.

  Despite  the  lengthy  MFSM manual, you're left  on  your  own as to how to
tackle your task - much the same as the original <Hacker>. The first thing is
obviously  to  make full use of its  visual facilities. How you configure the
screen is up to you - though it'll probably go something like this.

  On  one  you'll have the radar, which  centres on the MRU in operation, and
indicates the movements of the human guards and the security cameras that are
in operation. You'll need this information for the game of cat and mouse.

  You'll  also need a map of the base, but this'll have to indicate more than
where the rooms and corridors are. If you know which camera covers which area
you can be prepared for them, so you'll avoid alerting the guards.

  I didn't mention the video recorder facility before, but you can use it for
more  than catching last night's episode of <EastEnders>. As well as allowing
you to check all movements in an area during the last hour, you can play back
a  picture  of an empty room to the  security cameras, even while your MRU is
investigating a filing cabinet!

  All  the  pictures  are time synchronised, so  if  you fail to use the Fast
Forward  and  Reverse to match up the  video with the reality, the commissars
will have no question about whether it was real or Memorex! They'll liquidate
your droid, which could bring tears to your eyes!

           "HACKER" FROM ACTIVISION: A *100%* SOLUTION - AT LAST! :)
          By Jaromir Krol - "Jerry King". http://jaromirkrol.web.com


First things first - all the "special" actions are called with keys that they
begin with. That is, press U to go UP, D to go down, M to read MESSAGES, I to
use  INFRARED at night, C to call the spy in  each city. Y - yes, N - no. Use
RETURN to offer/confirm.

At one point in the game, two satellites will appear. If they catch you, they
will  give  you security clearance tests. They  will  ask you a question each
time  they  catch you. You can be caught  four  times. Then - it will be game
over! The answers to their questions are:

Security test level I: MAGMA, LTD.
Security test level II: AXD-0310479
Security test level III: HYDRAULIC
Security test level IV: AUSTRALIA

At  another point, your vehicle and its path will disappear and you won't see
your movement on the map. Be VERY CAREFUL from then on.

Okay  -  as the LOGON, give AUSTRALIA  (this will skip the initial test). Now
choose  the  time zone. Don't choose  yours, just highlight both Americas and
Europe.  This  will  help in the game. And  now  go! This is the full list of
moves  you need to make in each direction to complete the game. For instance,
6E stands for 6 moves to the east, 4N - four to the north, and so on. U means
going up, of course. :)


6E, 4N, U. Switzerland: Give $5000, buy the deed and the chronograph.
4W, 1N, 6E, 2S, 1E, U. Egypt: offer the chronograph, buy scarab and Tut.
1E, 1N, 1W, U. Italy: only offer Tut (don't buy anything).
1E, 2N, 2E, 3S, 1E, U. India: only offer scarab (don't buy).
1W, 3N, 16W, 1S, U. New York, US: offer the deed, buy the diamond (*).
6W, 1N, 14W, 2S, 5E, U. Japan: offer the diamond, buy pearls and the camera.
4W, U. China: offer pearls, buy jade carving.
1E, 3S, 2E, 1N, 4E, 1S, 2E, 1S, 2E, 1S, 8E, 3N, U. Cuba: only offer the camera.
8E, 2N, 2W, 1N, 3E, U. London: offer jade carving, buy Beatles' LP.
3W, 2S, 12W, 1N, 1E, U. San Francisco, US: only offer the Beatles' LP.
1W, 1S, 10E, 2N, 2W, 1S, 3W, U. Washington, US: VICTORY!


*  -  Reportedly,  in some versions of  the  game,  you should buy STOCKS AND
BONDS,  not  DIAMOND in NY, and you should  offer  those to the spy in Japan.
Also,  sometimes the spy in Cuba wants  the carving and the bloke from London
asks  for  the  camera. Oh, yes - there was  a  bug in my version of the game
(completed under VICE, the C64 emulator): 1 point to north of New York, there
was  a  "hidden" entrance to Cuba - when  you pressed U there, you went up to
Fidel's island. :)

INSTRUCTIONS
Herbert was visiting a large department store with his Mum and
Dad (Wally and Wilma!) when he got lost! Now the store is a scary
place and full of beasts which will hurt Herbert and make him
cry! Help Herbert to explore the store, manipulating the objects
he finds to help him get into the lost children office where
Wally and Wilma are waiting for him.  Objects are picked up by
walking into them, but you can only carry two objects at any one
time. Some rooms in the game are presented in the form of arcade
sub-games. These aren't just for fun - you have to complete them
to finish the game!

CHEATS
POKE 36739,X where X is the number of lives you'd like.

Complete solution! Taken from Emulate issue 4 :

1) First of all get the box key and get the honey pot.
2) Now go to the room that the game starts in and jump up on to
the box. This will spring you up to where you can exchange the
honey pot for the teddy.
3) Get the rope. Now with the rope and the teddy go to the arcade
room with the daleks in It.
4) The teddy will go and open the right handside door; you can
now go through this. Jump at the rope in the next room and
itshould extend into a room with a rubberduck, collect this.
5) Load the pop gun (with the cork) and go tothe castle.
6) Exchange the pop gun for the flag andwith the rubber duck go
to the seaside screen. You can now collect the pebbles toload the
catapult.
7) Now get the torch and the bulb, this willmend the torch.
8) Go to the dark room with the bulb and this will enable you to
see. Shoot all the ducks and a couple of rolls of caps should be
dropped. Put these somewhere convenient.
9) Get the A brick and the chocolate 10p and go to the screen
with the till.
11) Climb on top of the brick and walk past the till with the
chocolate 10p, this should now be exchanged for a real 10p.
12) Take the 10p and the bomb and then goto the room with the 10p
slot on the door and jump at it. You will now be in a Blitz game,
and when this is completed you will recelve a cannonball.
13) With this and the rolls of caps go to the room with the
cannon and walk through it.The cannonball will be launched and
a hole in the wall will be made.
14) Pass through this hole and get the spacehopper.
15) Then go back up to get the tennis racket, put the space
hopper in a convenient place.
16) Next go into the Breakout room and complete the game. Once
the Breakout game is completed you should receive a glove.
17) Get the space hopper and with the glove go to Level 1 where
there is a room with a hand guarding a door. You must now jump
into the room behind the hand (the hand will no longer harm you
because you have the glove).
18) You will be in a room with Wally and Wilma at the top of an
escalator. As you have the space hopper you will be able to jump
very high. This means that you can now jump up and switch the
escalator on and be reunited with Wally and Wilma to complete the
game.


SEQUELS/PREQUELS
Automania, Pyjamarama, Everyone's A Wally were all prequels
featuring the Week family.  Three Weeks in Paradise was a sequel,
and the final episode in the Wally series.

SCORES RECEIVED
Unknown off-hand, but all Wally games scored very highly in the
mags.

URL
All of Mikro-Gen's games are available from the following
directory :
ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/sinclair/snaps/games/by-company/mikr
o-gen/

The filenames are as follows :
Herbert's Dummy Run :    herberts-dummy-run.zip
Automania :              automania.zip
Pyjamarama :             pyjamarama.zip
Everyone's A Wally :     everyones-a-wally.zip
Three Weeks in Paradise :3-weeks-in-paradise.zip

GENERAL FACTS
Dummy Run was the fourth game to feature the Week family, and the
first one to star Wally's son, Herbert, as the central character.

Herbert previously appeared in Everyone's a Wally, but was only
a little baby then and just crawled around to get in your way!

Herbert makes a further appearance in Three Weeks in Paradise,
where he's in danger of being eaten by Cannibals!

The sub-games included in Dummy Run include Space Invaders with
Daleks, breakout and a Carnival-style shooting gallery!

There is a cheat mode which you can activate by climbing one of
the ropes in the room to the left of where you start and holding
down certain keys. However, I can't remember which rope and which
keys...


NOTES
Not the best of the Wally games, in fact it's probably the worst
(not counting Automania, which is a straight arcade game). That's
not to say it's bad though..it's still a really good game. Some
of the sub-games are great fun on their own.

 HERO'S QUEST
    Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 This walkthru is for a thief character. Other character types can use it, but
they will not get the full benefit.

 When you create your thief, make sure you increase its strength, intelligence,

Press <CR> for more !



CompuServe             TEG-10178

vitality, parry, and magic at least once. It is highly recommended that you give
the extra point to strength, but do with it as you please. You are ready to
begin the game.

 FREEING THE BARONET

 When you enter the town, you automatically go to the sheriff. The sheriff
rambles on about the town and the valley, and he will eventually ask you for
your name. Press return after the test box has been displayed (with your name
already in it). After the conversation, go up to him and ask him about the guild
hall.

 !
CompuServe             TEG-10178

 Go left to the guild hall and enter it. Go to the book and sign it. Go to the
board, look at it, and read the notices on it. Go to the guild master and ask
him about the hall. You will have to repeat the question as he is asleep, and
the first time you ask the question, it just wakes him up. Then ask him about
Antwerps. Once he recounts the story, leave the guild hall. (Of course, you do
realize the tourists were the two guys from Andromeda.)

 Being bored with this, go to the inn (one screen to the right) and ask the
innkeeper about the inn. If you wish, you can also ask him about Shema (his
wife), Abdulla Doo (his friend), and about the lost caravan.

 Once you are finished, leave the inn and go to the upper right (until you

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe             TEG-10180

change screens). Go to the centaur and ask her about the fruit and her father.
Buy fruit (do this six times) and vegetables (do this 2 times).

 Next, go to the dry goods store and ask the merchant about the weapons he has,
or about the store. Buy two flasks and one dagger, then leave the store. Exit
the town by going down to the lower right part of the screen.

 Once outside the town, go down two times, and right once. Take some of the
water from the falls. Try climbing the cliff (try about four times). If that
does not work, take some rocks, and start throwing them. Keep on doing this
until you hit the door three times, which will make the hermit come out. (This
took me 18 tries.) Once he comes out and shows you the ladder, climb up the

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10181

cliff. Go to the door and knock. After knocking, go right twice (the first right
brings you to the rock; the second presses you against it so that you can
survive).

 Enter the cave and sit down at the table. Ask the hermit about the cave, his
family, the ladder, the spell, and finally about the trigger spell. Ask for the
scroll (respond yes to his question), then take the scroll. Say thank you and
leave.

 Climb down and go left six times. Near the end of this trip, you should be
following a white stag. When you enter this little niche of the woods, the dryad
appears. When she asks "Are you one with the woods?" say yes. Leave by going to

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10182

the right, then go up. Take some mushrooms (type it in twice), then eat some
mushrooms (do this only _once_). The colors are neat, huh?

 After your psychedelic experience, go up four times; ignore the goblin screen.
Go to the skull at the gate and ask about the deal. (Respond yes to his
question.) Now, go down, right, up, right, and up. Once here, you will see the
seed and the plant the dryad wanted. As a thief, try climbing up the rocks and
catching the seed. You can also throw a rock and knock the seed out of the air,
or you can cast a fetch spell. Once you have the seed, go right, up, right, and
up.

 This is Erana'a Peace. Go to the tree and take some flowers (do this twice),

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10184

then eat some of the fruit. After eating the fruit, sleep. (If you're a magic
user, the rock here has the calm spell. You must go to the rock and cast the
open spell. The rock will move and the scroll for the calm spell will be hidden
underneath.) After sleeping, go down, then right.

 There is a extremely large, tough ogre here. You _do not_ want to fight this
ogre. When he starts walking toward you, go down and around him, dodge him, and
enter the cave. Go up to the bear and feed him. (If you're a magic user, you can
cast the calm spell.) "Sneak" so you are now tip-toeing. Go right, then go to
the kobold. Take the key from him, and go left. Use the key on the bear, and he
will be transformed into the missing baronet!

 Unfortunately, you are still in the cave. Go down and you will immediately be

saved your game before doing so. The sane thing to do is escape the battle, and
go to the left. Go to the left again, then down four times.

 Go to the centaur and ask him about his farm, the brigands, the brigands'
leader, and the warlock. You can also ask him about the healer, harvest time,
and crops.

 Go to the right, then go to the tree, and climb it. This will take many, many
attempts (it took me about 21 tries). Once you're up in the tree, look at the
nest, then at the ring. Take the ring. Go to the house and knock on the door.
Give the ring to the healer. You automatically leave the house, so you have to
knock on the door again. Once inside the second time, look at the house and the
bird. Give some of the flowers from Erana's Peace to her (do this only once so
you'll still have some), then give her all your mushrooms. Buy the undead

unguent and leave.

 Go right three times and you will meet the big bad dude from the north. _Do
not_ try to fight this guy because he will turn you into mincemeat (just in time
for Christmas) in a second. Casting a spell at him won't work, either; even
before you complete the spell, you will have endangered yourself. Instead,
bargain with him, and give him your fruit. Leave (go to the left once), and rest
here for a while (rest as may times as you can).

 Go down and to the left twice. If you meet a fox, free him from the trap. You
are back at the town gates. Go up twice so that you're in front of the castle.
The guard will open the gate for you. Now, go up twice to the front entrance to

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe             TEG-10188

the castle doors where you are formally congratulated by the old windbag of a
king. Ask him about the curse, Baba Yaga, his daughter, and finally, the baronet
(you can tell he was thankful for what you did). Leave the room by going left.

 Go down then to the right. Go to the window and answer yes to the proposal made
by the stable manager. Once you are finished cleaning up the stable (ugh!), go
to the left, and down. Yell up to the guard and ask him about the rewards. Go
down twice and left once so that you enter the town.

 Go left and up into the magic shop. Here you can buy either the open spell, the
dart spell, or the fetch spell. You should buy at least one of them (the open
and/or the dart spell). You can also buy a potion if you want. _Do not_ spend

all your money as there as more important things left to get. While Zara is here
ask, her about the valley, the town, the Aura, magic, Baba Yaga, Erasmus,
wizards, the Curse, and the Baron.

 Leave the shop, go right, then to the upper right. Go to the dry goods store
and buy two daggers. Leave the town and go the dryad (from the town gates go
down twice and left five times). Respond yes to her question, and take the acorn
from the ground.

 Go right, up twice, then left twice. Talk to the Meeps. Ask the green Meep
about magic, and ask it for some green fur. Take the scroll and the fur.

 Go right twice then up three times. Go to the skull and respond yes. Give it
the gem and go past the gate. Say the rhyme ("Hut of brown, now sit down"),
enter the hut, and go to the pot. When asked, say your name, and respond yes to
the next two questions.

 Go down twice and save your game. Go to the bush in which the goblin is hidden
(the upper right), go to the left, and as the bush moves, type in "kill bush."
Once you have killed the goblin, search the body. Once you have the money from
the goblin, go right. Beware: Now that you have killed the first goblin,
whenever you enter, the goblins will want to fight you. You will have to start
the fight, but whenever you kill them, they will come back in stronger numbers
(e.g., after killing the first goblin, the next time you will have to kill two

goblins).

 Go right four times to the healer's hut. Knock on the door and give her the
acorn, the water, and the green fur. Ask her about the potion components she
needs. Leave and rest outside.

 Go down three times, left, then up. Throw your daggers at the board. Take your
daggers back. Keep doing this until it is night (be careful because your screen
will not change; you have to check the time with the Control-T function). Once
it is night, climb the town wall, go to the upper right, and to the left to the
bar. Go up into the alley and then to the flashing coin.

 When the thieves appear, show them the thief's sign. They will tell you the
password. Once you know the password, leave the alley. Go into the bar and go to
the Goon. Tell him the password.

 Listen to the guild master's outrage, then go to Bruno (the guy behind the
door) and buy a license, some thief's tools, and an extra pick. Go to the guild
master and ask him about the guild, the brigands, and a traitor. Play the dagger
game with him. (Note: His accuracy with the dagger increases with the amount you
bet.) Once finished, leave by climbing the ladder, and exiting the bar.

 This is were it gets extremely tricky. You must watch your clock; when it
becomes midnight, you must leave the town, and go to the farm on the northern

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10194

side of the town. Use the undead unguent, then go to the left and down. Take the
mandrake root which is on the tombstone to your left (it's the red plant coming
out of the ground near the tombstone). While you're out here, go back to the
screen with the mushrooms (down twice and left three times). Dance for the
fairies, then ask for some fairy dust. As soon as you have both the fairy dust
and mandrake root, return to the town and make your way back to the bar.

 From the bar, go left one screen, and go up to the pink house. Pick the door
(this will take a few tries). Once inside, "sneak." Get the music box, the
candelabra, and the vase. Go back to the desk and search it. Go to the painting,
move it, pick the safe, and take the coins. Once you have the coins, close the
safe and replace the painting. Leave the house and "walk." Go down and left.

and search it. Pet the cat, leave the house, and climb the town wall.

 Note: Make sure you clean out all of these houses before dawn.

 Go down once, left twice, up four times, left, and up. Say the rhyme again.
Enter the house and answer yes to the witch's question.

 FREEING ELSA AND FULFILLING THE PROPHECY

 Once Baba Yaga's speech is over, go down, right, down, right twice, and climb
the town wall. (If it is daylight, enter the town through the gate.) Go to the
thieves guild. Once in the thieves guild, go to Bruno and sell the music box,
candelabra, vase, candlesticks, and pearls. Leave the guild and the bar.

 Wait for daybreak. Once dawn has arrived, go back into the alley and give the
beggar some money. Ask about the brigands, thieves, the bar, and dragon breath,
then leave the alley.

 Go to the healer's house and give her the fairy dust. Go out, then reenter and
get the dispel potion. Go back to the town gate and wait for midday. Once it is
midday, from the town gate go down once (if you're at the healer's house when
midday arrives, go down twice), then go to your left. Bruno and Brutus should be
here, but it is a slightly random thing. Listen to what they say. If you can,
kill Brutus with long-range weapons like thrown daggers and the dart spell. If
you cannot kill Brutus this way, go down then up quickly...very _quickly_. If

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe             TEG-10199

you don't, you will be killed by Bruno. Kill Brutus. Once he is dead, search his
body and take the key.

 Next, go down, left, up twice, right twice, then down. Bruno should be here. Go
up to him and buy some information about the thieves guild, the Baron, and Baba
Yaga. When you leave, he should say something about the dragon breath, and you
should gain two points.

 Go down twice, left three times, and down one more time. Go to the left of the
screen and search the rocks. Use the key on the door, then open it. Go forward
slightly (but not much!) and say Hiden Goseke. The troll should move back. Enter
the cave, go left, down, then right. Exit the screen on the lower right cave. Do
 !
CompuServe             TEG-10200

not go left!

 Here you should cast the calm spell then go to the gate. Either pick the door,
or cast an open spell. Once it's unlocked, open the gate, and go in.

 This is the trap room. Go to the far left and go forward. Cross the chasm using
the right-hand plank (the one with a square on it). Once you have crossed the
chasm, go to the two stacks. Be careful! Once you are close to the stacks, go in
between them by moving DIAGONALLY. Go to the door and open it.

 This is a time-pressure event, so go quickly. First, close and lock the door.
Then, go to the chair by the door (upper right side), and "use" the chair to

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10201

block the door. Go to the candelabra and wait for some of the brigands to enter.
Once they are near the table, "use" the candelabra to block their path. Go to
the lower part of the table and wait. Once they start to move (wait until the
second or third one has started to move), "use" the rope, and do your Tarzan
impression. When this is finished, open the door and meet ME.

 This is the warlock. Ask him about the brigands, the mirror, Elsa, Toro, the
enchantment, and a dispel potion. Also you can ask him about himself, the search
for Elsa, and the Baron. When you start moving, he disappears using his private
exit.

 This maze is actually very easy. First, go right and up. Then, go left and

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe             TEG-10202

through the door. When you come out, go down and right through the next door.
Pull the chain after you appear by the doorway. Go back, left, then up through
the door. Go up to the door there, and "open" it. _Quickly_ go back or to your
left. Once the board has fallen, go to the door and open it.

 Here you meet Elsa. Once you see her and she has challenged you, use the dispel
potion on her. She and Elsa escape into the wild, blue yonder. Get the healing
potions and the mirror. Go to your right and enter the caves again. Leave the
caves and go to Baba Yaga's hut (up five times, left, then up again). Enter the
hut, but this time use the mirror. You have done it: You have completed the
prophecy!

 ADDITIONAL ENCOUNTERS AND ITEMS

 1. The walkthru didn't cover the encounter with Erasmus. This was omitted
because it is not really useful for thieves. But this is the only way to get
Razzle Dazzle. When you meet Erasmus, you can ask him about magic, the Aura, and
wizards. Once you win against him, he gives you the spell. When you have it, you

can leave.

 2. The walkthru doesn't return a troll's beard or a cheetaur's claw to the
healer. Doing so is worth a couple of points.

 3. A fighter should kill one (at least) of every type of creature.

 4. Sleep with the hermit. This is fun.

 5. Kill the Ogre. This is hard, but fun to try. Hint: Try attacking him first
with long-range weapons, and fight him for a while, then escape and drink some
potions. Use some more dart spells on him, then kill him during the fight.

key from him.

Two Ways to enter. (Save game)
1. Go straigt into the fort by dodging the arrows and type CLIMB WOOD which you 
will face three brigands. You can't escape from them so I hope your character
is good. Once you've defeated all three drink your potions. Then go up and 
you'll fight the minotaur once you've killed him you search his body. You can't
rest one time when your in the area of the fort so best to use vigor potions.
2. Go where the antwerp is and go to the wall of rocks and type SEARCH ROCKS 
and you'll find a hole then USE KEY and PUSH ROCK then say the PASSWORD(HIDEN 
GOSEKE) which will avoid you from the troll. You can go kill the troll if you
wish and search a pile of gold. but anyway go to the lower right once in the
cave and you'll be right where the minotaur is. You can throw rocks at the 
minotaur if you want but don't get busted. Anyway CAST CALM and the Minotaur
will fall asleep.

2 Getting pass the courtyard and wall:(Save game)
After beating the minotaur or putting him to sleep just keep typing CLIMB WALL
once you go up to it on the right side. <<DON'T RING THE BELL!>> once over the
wall you'll face obsticles.

Aunt  Hildegarde  says: "As I followed your progress I began to realize you
and  I  were  not the only ones on the estate. My suspicions were confirmed
when I received a rap on the skull. The next thing I knew was being tied to
this  buzz saw by your cousin HERMAN.......I guess he couldn't stand to see
you  inherit  the  family's  fortune.  Well, it's all yours now. I knew you
could  do it. I'm sorry I put you through all this, Pumpkin, but your Uncle
Buddy and I had to be sure that whoever inherited the estate and the studio
would  be  clever enough to handle it all. The only way I could be sure the
stipulations in my will would be carried out would be to oversee it myself,
so I faked my death. Tomorrow we'll go see my lawyer and he'll take care of
all  the  paper  work.  I  know  you'll  take good care of Hildebud and the
studio. As for me, I'm sure it won't be long before the Press discovers I'm
alive. I plan to go to the south of France for a rest while the story leaks
out.  It  will be great publicity for the studio, and let's hope we've seen
the last of your Cousin Herman".
             YOUR SCORE IS 150 POINTS OUT OF 150, IN 525 MOVES

    5. Home if not under attack.
 * Careless handling of RED ROCKS will put you in hot water. But might be
   the ticket for finding the flame thrower.
 * Somewhere there is a Flame Thrower.
 * Elmer supplies fuel for your Flame Thrower, he also likes to take long
   hikes Southwest of town, see elmer run!
 * Imprecise directions to the Ant Hole: It's off the South edge of the main
   map near the South West corner. You can't get there via button click.
 * Precise Directions to the Ant Hole:
     Fly, drive tank or walk, (via Ore Plant), to Mine No.1...
      1. From verticle center line of building, go due South, (about one
         screen), to second cresent shaped rock, (it will be directly in
         your path).
      2. Immediately East of this rock, is a small green clump. (bush?).
      3. Visually draw a verticle line South to a large tear-drop rock,
         (about 3").
      4. About 1/3 South, (call it an inch), between these two points, and
         a bit East, is a large green tree. Immediately South East of tree
         is a very small stone. The next object South and a little East is a
         medium size stone.
      5. Draw a horizontal line West from this stone.
      6. The intersection of these two lines exactly marks the Ant Hole,

           There is no hill or other distinguishing features nearby. When
         closed on cold days, it will look like normal desert texture. It
         opens when the ants are going in or out, and closes immediatly.
           Sometimes it remains open, (? Glitch, Hi-Temp ?), not sure why.
         If you're going to call an Air Strike on it, it's a good idea to 
         mark it with a nice juicy dead ant.

           Hey! I know that took all night long! But if I had said;
         'it's near the tree', you probably would've walked right over the
         sucker and got yourself bitten on the ass!


 * You'll need to get 7 hrs. sleep at least every 48 hrs. or you'll have
   auto accidents, heed the warnings or you'll be ogleing Nurse Judy's
   cleavage again. 
 * More evidence of ants delivered to Dr. Wells yields more ant info. from
   Wells.
 * Our buddy, Mr. Billy Bob Morse, has grand plans for the ants,
   (his daughter told me in an intimate moment). He isn't on our side.
 * Buy Geeze a drink and he'll tell you where he found the rock samples.


 Airplane Aeriobatics:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  CONTROLS - Get in, Stick forward increases speed, Stick back decreases
   speed, Stick L/R makes quarter turns. Four quick flicks will do a
   one-eighty on a dime. Fire button: In air    - releases bug bomb.
                                                  (2 addtn'l ea. day)
                                      On ground - exits plane.

  ALTITUDE - Once in the air, Stick forward/backward controls speed and
   thus altitude... some rocks and fences are higher than others, a tough
   lesson to learn. Fuel is limited, but at the right speed you can 
   circumnavigate the entire map with a single tiger in your tank.
     Bear with me...

       1. The seperation of plane and its shadow is the only indication
          of altitude... till you hit something!
       2. IF, while in the air, AND flying at a right angle to screen,
          ( that's ORTHOGONAL in techie talk ), you can see any
          ground color between wing edge and shadow. Then you're flying
          TOO HIGH and TOO FAST, ie; wasting fuel.
       3. Slow down enough to make wing edge and shadow touch or overlap
          by one pixel and you'll clear everything on the ground, AND
          conserve fuel.

     You can land/takeoff and exit the airplane anywhere you can fly it,
   but, return to the airport or exchange winks with Nurse Judy.
     Desert landings are possible with heroic manuvering between the
   rocks and trees.

                       will take VERY good care of you.


ANTS:
~~~~~

 ANTENNAS -  No hit = Lose round & fast trip to hospital.
              1 hit = Draw.
              2 hit = Win & Go to ground sequence.
                NOTE: A win in the Mine Tunnel just puts you above ground
                      back at the Ore Plant.
                TIPS: 1. If you didn't get 'em before head is off screen,
                         move gun extreme left at correct height and blaze
                         away.
                       
                      2. If you still didn't get 'em, move gun into position
                         before screen goes black. You'll have time for 3
                         fast shots in the close-up. You can get both
                         antennas if you're quick enough and still call it
                         a win.
    
                      3. Aim about half way up antenna, hits at base don't                         
                         work.
    
                      4. Shots from side are easier, Both antennas can be
                         clipped off with a single lucky shot.
    

 NEST     -  Located due South of Mine No.1, about one screen. That's off
             the main map, but you can fly over it or drive tank to it and
             even walk to it from Mine No.1.
          -  Entrance will remain open under certain circumstances could
             be when ants are running rampant or when temperature is above
             90deg. Either way it's not a good sign.

 WEATHER  -  Ants like mild weather. Count on them showing above ground if
             temperature is 70 - 80deg. and no rain or high winds. If temp.
             is higher or lower they can still be found in the mines.

 GROUND SEQUENCE - Direction(s) ants come from when attacking indicate
                   positions of map that have already overrun.
                 - Move as little as possiable, try to draw ants into a
                   column.
                 - Shots up/down screen are 1/3 longer that L/R.
                 - Learn to shoot on diagonals and you'll clean house!
                 - Beaware of barriers & escape routes, you can out run
                   'em but it takes a lot of room.
                 - Fences, rocks and other barriers are indestructable
                 - Buildings can be blown up.

 GENERAL ALERT   - Declared by the Mayor
                 - Command your own army from the situation map.
                 - Army: 99, Police: 40, Construction: 60, Townfolk: 80.
                 - Don't forget the Mine Tunnel, M1 & M2.
                 - Air Strike & Tanks become avaliable.


SAVE GAME:       - Save game to disk labeled -    DSAVE:
~~~~~~~~~~         NOTE: One game per disk, use several as the game can 
                         turn suddenly at any time.


HOSPITAL ANTICS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Before giveing it all away I need to say that the Hospital Escape segment
 is one of the cleverest and *FRUSTRATING* arcade bits I've ever experienced
 in a computer game. My hat is off to Cinemaware for dreaming up this little
 taste of insanity! Here is how it is done...


  Mistake No.1 - You've <IMPATIENTLY> selected 'Escape Hospital' as your next move. Forget it, your'abed & jabbed already! But you're gonna go anyway, because the alternative is watching your littl u tare at the ceiling all night, (REAL TIME!).


  Mistake No.2 - Yer watchin' the traffic. OK! Looks good! Pop the fire button and yer outta the sacHey! what a cute little hospital johnny you're wearing!).

                               FAIR WARNING:
      You are now certified !RAW MEAT! for anything else that is moving!

  Whooops... Here comes a Candy Striper from off screen. Will she open my door? [ Bubba. If she's on same planet she's gonna open your door.] No sweat, back to the bed, slap the button, and yer in n oered, chuckeling up your non-existant sleeve while she checks your chart.
   Now she's gone, lets break for the hallway, Hmm, nice automatic doors in this 50's hospital.

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]
  Jeasus! What is this!? Chariots of Fire? I'm tryin' to SNEAK outta this place  
an' I get a fanfair like it's the second comming! Oh well, at least it's motivating. Lets go!

  OK, Swingin' down the hall, I'm goin' for the stairwell and elevator I spotted last time. And thise I AM gonna make it! Around this next corner and cut to the middle of this floor. Coast looks cla.G for it!
  Damm! Here comes one of thoes green ball busters yellin' "There he is...
 Get 'em!". And to top it off he's between me and the elevator.
  Wait a sec', there's room right here and I'm right next to the door. Shoot
 in and hide out till he passes, No, I tried that before and he just waits at the door for me. Lets jumpin' into bed with the blond. SHIT! she's screamin' her ass off. OK, there's an empty right hee r that bed. *click* and covered  . Hehee! He came in and didn't spot me. This is p-r-r-r-e-t-t- sic.
  Alright. Back out in the hall, elevators in range...
 "There he goes...", Loud mouth bitch! Didn't see her turn the corner... No wait, here's an office, the door, it closes. Yeah but what if she comes in!?  What's this... a desk? Lets see... *click* yashung out from under that johnny I'm wearin', but I skinned right under that desk, (this place s ul o suprises),
 Yep, she checked out the room, but left anyway, YEAAAH! Got it knocked now baby! Shoot for the moonDing! Ding! ], Elevator sweet elevator!
                                 Go-ing down...

  First floor you-are-soo-beautiful! Alright now, remember you can cut the corners an' out run 'em oe diagonal. Just don't let 'em touch ya or get right behind ya for too long. Missed me! Nanaah! Js sI thought there's the front door... right between... those two guys... in the... grey suits...                              !!! NUTS !!!
 Caught in a squeeze play by the two guerrillas watchin' the door. Aah, well. Take me Nurse Judy, I'st putty in your hands. But NEXT time I'm takein' a ride on the green < WHEEL CHAIR > I glimpsed ptis!


  Mistake No.3 - Back in the hospital again after a hard day down at the ant farm. Call the Weather ion - "Warm tommorrow, high in the 70's" Jeeeze!
The whole country side will be crawling with ants... I gotta get outa here...

                        *click* 'Escape Hospital'

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]

  Ooo-Kaay, Traffic is light and if I remember correctly that wheel chair was right...  over... hereOH! NOO!! They moved it on me! Don't panic! Keep it together now... if you can out run giant antsotie you sure as hell can
deal with this bunch of bozos in here. Lets try another corner... Heaah!
There it is! That nurse is gaining on me... better think fast. What do I need to do to fire-up this r. Watch out! Dodge right...
  Wheeeeee! Hey, all I needed to do was jump on the sucker. Eat my dust turkeys! Got them clowns folng me around like Key-Stone Cops. I can even stop and wait for 'em to catch up... then peel rubbe!Tos goons downstairs are gonna be a piece-o-cake this time!
  Alright, reality check here, obviously the stairs are out, an' I gotta be sure somebody doesn't fo me into the elevator, so I'll get a big lead and shoot the curl... [ Ding! Ding! ] Made it!

  First Floor: Socks, Lingerie aaand tickets home! Mama! Around the corners, Whooup! Lets backtrack ttle... Keep 'em streatched out and wait for a break... Yeah! there it is! This Wheelin' Demon ishai' for wide open road!
  Dodge left... right... one fer the grey monkey... two fer the grey goon... Check it out! the frontrs are o-p-e-n-i-n-g...

          *! BAM !* ...    What!!!? They got me!? I was half way out the door, and they STILL got meat is this Catch 22...? some kinda Monty Python movie...? I think I want my ticket money back... ataminnit... Just before the screen went black as Nurse Judy's soul, while the doors were open threfo asecond... were thoes... did I see... < STEPS > right outside the door? Sonafa-Gun! they were sps.. OK. I got your number now... NEXT time I'm gonna JUMP OUTTA the wheel chair when the doors oe up!
  Mistake No.4 - Whew! I was ready for this trip in the meat wagon. Thoes grenades will blow up ants buildings, but wouldn't even touch that
stinkin' little piece of rail fence they had me up against. Gotta remember to stay out of the cornert least I've got the Hospital routine worked out,
I'm ready, I be bad! I'll be back on the streets in a flash!!!

            [ (trumpets) TA! TATATATATATA! TATATATATATATATATA! ]

  A-Second Floor... it's al-right!
      A-Wheel Chair... it's awl-right!
          A-Elevator... it's awl-right!
               Shut 'em down,  Shut 'em down,  Baby gonna Shut 'em down!!

  Well Awl-Right! The slide for home base at the front doors realy did the trick... Now I'm out and in' mean and rowdy. Lets check the time... Oh no! it's after sundown! All that fancy foot work shtterest of the day right
in the butt! Guess I might as well head on home and get a good nights rest...   Hmmmmmm, I could havne that right here in the Hospital! With Nurse Judy holding my hand allll night long!

   The dammable part of the Hospital Escape is that it is completely
unnecessary... But the challenge is irresistable.
   Fact is that if time is so critical that you must get out, then your game
is shot-to-hell anyway, But that's another mistake altogether!



                          -  PRODUCT DISCLAIMER  -

  The information contained in this Pre-walk thru is as accurate as I have
been able to determine WITH OUT COMPLETEING the game. Time acounting and 
sequences of events may very well be subject to some as yet undiscovered
factor(s?). Perhaps I should have titled this document: LETS PUT OUR HEADS
TOGETHER and SEE WHAT'S COOKIN' IN THE DESERT. But that was too long to type!
 I know that you're playing DESERT also TimeX, and you to Doc Rock, (even if you won't admit to it)... if this stuff helps and you beat the game before
I do, feel free to use it as a starter and post your own walk-thru.

Here it is!!! The solve to....

      Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Indy music added here)
                      by Shadow Dragon (who else?)

Well, there are lots of random things in the game so what might
work for me wont work for everyone cause I am not entirley sure
what parts are random.

   In the beginning, you can go box if ya want by going to your
locker room. Then go out the door and talk to Marcus. Ask him
about the guy's situation and the new archaeologist. Then go
back to the 1st door you saw and open it. When inside, tell the
kids you have a solution for everyone and for the secretary to
take down their names. When inside your office, pick up all the
junk mail and papers to get the package. Open the package and
there's the grail diary! Then leave by the window.
   Then go to Henry's house and go to the bedroom. Pick up the
painting of the trophy. Go back to the living room and pick up
the plant and table cloth to move them. Then go to the leaning
bookcase and push it. Get the tape on the back of the bookcase.
Go back to your office and use the jar of liquid on the tape. Go
back to your dad's house and open the chest with it. Get the old
book and leave to Italy.
   In the library, go to the lower shelves to look for books.
Keep going to the lower shelves until Mein Kampf, biplane
instruction book, and a catacombs book are found. Mein Kampf is
the leaning book, the biplane book is black and in a how-to-do
enclopedia like series. The catacombs is a yellow book in a
series about maps of ancient Rome. Now go find the post and red
cordon and pick them up. After that, open the computer version of
the grail diary and it will show a window and tell what plaque to
look at. Go find the correct window and look at it. It says it's
the correct window.Now look at the correct plaque and use the post
on the slab with the roman numeral from the plaque.
   Now look at the book about the catacombs. The top map is the
upper level which you're on and the lower map is the bottom
level. The sections where it shoes a closer view of Indy are the
round looking parts which connect tunnels. Find the nearest one
from the one you started from and go there to pick up the
skeleton's arm/hook. Now keep going till you come to the
manhole. Go up it and look at the wine bottle near the lovers.
Get the wine bottle and use it in the fountain. Go back to the
torch you should have passed along the way to get to the
manhole. Use the bottle on it and pick it up.
   You should have fallen into a passge. Go right and choose the
room on the right. Keep going past the bridge to look at the
inscription. The inscription will narrow the grail choices to 2.
BE SURE TO WRITE THEM DOWN. That is very important for the
end.Now go to the plug and use the hook and whip on it. Go to
the room on left and climb the ladder. Then go right and go to
the room to the southeast where water use to be until the plug
was pulled. Continue along the passage.
   Go north into the machine room and use the red cordon on the
machine. Then use the wheel to operate it. Leave and go east and
north and east again to a room with statues. Use the computer grail
book again and push the statues to correct combo. Enter the door
and go in a westerly direction past the bridge and skeleton room.
In the next section go northwest to the skull playing room. Look at
the computer grail book for the correct notes and play them. Enter
the door and continue to go in an easterly direction to the tomb.
Open the tomb and look and then go to the lock and pull it.
Leave to the castle where your father is!
   Once in the castle, ask the butler if he has relatives near
him and till him Otto sent you but he is ok. Then say you have
proof you are telling the truth. Go north to passageways and go
south then east. Choose the lower door on the east wall. Talk to
the drunk about everything except don't say he's drunk. After
getting the stein from him, go to the next door in the hallway
just above the one you're in. Once there, get the ale from keg
and use it in the fire place. Get more ale and get the roast
boar after it cools off. Go back to castle entrance and go to
the hall.
   I am not sure if the guards are random about what you can say
to keep from fighting them. I will tell what I said. Go to south
hallway and tell the guard you have come to interrogate the
prisoner, you are Gestapo, and ask if he's leaking information.
Then go to 1st room on right to get servant uniform. Then go to
room on left and push the suit of armor in the far right corner.
Leave and go to north hallway. Tell the guard you're selling
leather jackets for $15 and you have authorization. Go upstairs
and go south and east. Enter the north door and open the trunk
to get money. Then wear servant uniform. Walk south to the guard
and give him the painting. Watch the cut-scene about the
painting and change back to Indywear.
   Now go to east end of hallway and north. Enter the door and
open the trunk for the uniform. Look at the uniform to get the
key. Go back to where you got the servant uniform and unlock the
officer uniform. Go back to where you found the key and wear the
officer uniform. Now go north to hallway and walk east. Tell the
guard you are on official bussiness and new here. After asking
for authorization, tell him to go talk to the colonel. Go south
and enter the room on west side. Get the 1st aid kit and leave.
Go north and west till you can go west no more. Go north and
enter the 1st door you come to. Tell the guard you're on
official business. Leave by the way you came in and continue on.
   Go north and enter the door farthest right. Tell the guard
you're on official business, you're new, and when he asks about
you ask him if he has clerance. Open the door and enter and open
the window. Go outside and walk to the 3rd window. Open it and
enter. Push the loose brick near the window and go back outside.
Use the whip on the brick and enter the 1st window on 3rd level.
Open the cabinet to get money and come back for your father
later. Go back to 2nd level by pointing the arrow at the 3rd
window. Once inside, wear the officer uniform. Open the door and
go to the door on the far left. Give Mein Kampf to the guard and
use the stein with ale on the grating. Leave and go to the
stairs leading to 3rd level.
   Go to the 1st door you find. Before entering, tell the guard
he has wrinkled pants, a stain, and for the buffoon to get out
of your way. In the office, give the roast to the dog. Get the
trophy and open the cabinet to get the pass. Go back to 2nd
level where you gave the guy the painting. This times go to the
room on the far left. Go to the Mona Lisa and move it. Open the
vault and go in. Look at the painting. I couldn't tell anything
except it made the grail seem to be a bowl. Not sure though.
Leave and go to the ale place and fill the trophy with ale. Be
sure to change uniforms before 1st level. Go back to 3rd level
and give the trophy to the big strong Nazi. Go south and tell
the guy the same thing you told the guard about the security
clearance. Go west and north into a room. Get the key there and
go back east and north. Unlock the door your father is in and go
to any guard. They will capture you and put you tied up in
chairs near the knight in armor.
   Have Henry push the chair so the space between the 2 chairs
is at the mark you made earlier on the carpet. Have Indy push
the armor. Once free, push the top statue and leave. Go the
motorcycle and talk to the guard at the guard post. Tell him you
are a superior officer on a top secret mission with no ID. Once
in Germany, have Hitler sign the passcard that had the
combination on it. At the airport, have Indy ask the man about
his grandchildren. Then switch to Henry to steal the tickets.
Leave and go to the biplane or the blimp. Know what to do from
the book if you decide to use the biplane. You don't have much
time. If you go to the blimp, give the man your tickets.
   In the blimp, have Henry put a coin in the piano man's cup.
Then have Indy enter the door and push the radio. Fight the guy
and open the cabinet for the wrench. Leave and use the wrench in
the hole and turn it. Save the game before hand. Climb the
ladder and run from the guards. Go up the ladder in the top left
corner. Keep  going up the ladders to 3rd level. On 3rd level
run to a different ladder going down. Go down to 1st level and
this time you'll go to the biplane. Henry will already be there.
Fly around and dodge the plane. Just don't let them shoot ya
down for a while. After crashing, choose the expensive looking car.
   Give the pass to the guards at the guard posts. Once outside
the grail temple save the game for the last time. Once inside,
go to Donovan and go past the 3 trials. If you die on the trials
you will have to start over from the 1st. The 1st trial is
tricky. You have to get Indy to go more south or he will get cut
all up. The 2nd trial is easy. All you have to do is step on
letters that spell out the word Indy keeps saying. Just wait
till he says the word. For the 3rd trial, immediatly possition
the pointer over the cave to the right and press return to go
there. Once inside, you must choose the correct grail from the
written version of the grail book the game comes with and use it
in the water. Then you can pick up the grail after rescuing your
father and give it to the knight. You can also give it to Elsa
and look at the seal once it is broken to use your whip to get
the grail back. Be sure to give it to the knight. After that,
the game ends! Pretty good game, huh? Corny jokes though.
Good luck. Later....

    This is a text file to guide you through Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade
without revealing the solution to the game. THIS IS NOT A SOLVE because of the
game's randomizing various things and also not to ruin the enjoyment of the
game.   These hints are VERY vague and its up to you to use your detective work
and figure the rest out.  INDY3 is a GREAT game and should not be played with a
complete solve.  However, in some cases we will give you more than a simple
hint.


BEGINNING

1. Remember to pick up the Grail Diary from your office.
2. Get the stick tape from your fathers house (behind bookshelf)
3. Use stick tape with the jar in your office.
4. Use key in the chest which is located in your fathers house.
5. Get painting from your fathers house (in his bedroom)
6. Go to Venice.

VENICE

1. Get wine bottle from lovers.
2. Fill wine bottle with water.
3. From library get 2 books,if you search the shelves they are obvious.
4. Go to window that looks JUST like the window in the grail diary.
5. Read qoute in diary. This will give you the slab number to open.
    (example: he who enters, enters second on the right.
               This means second number on the right hand incription.)
6. Look on incriptions on the statues to find the roman numeral.
7. Once in caves, get hook.
8. Go to the cavern with torch (We will leave it up to you to figure out what
    you should do.)
9. Once you have fallen into level 2(hint..hint) go to place where wooden plug
    is leaking.  Walk across bridge to read incriptions. READ INCRIPTIONS, and
    WRITE THEM DOWN. It is crucial to the ending of the game.
10. Go back to place with plug.  You want to remove the plug.  To do this you
    need to use 2 things that you have in you inventory. You can figure that out
    also.
11. Once plug is removed go back to 1st level. Use ladder in another cavern to
    do so.
12. Once on upper level find cavern where water used to be. (If you found this
    cavern before, it was where the pool of water was, and it would not let
    INDY swim.)
13. Now find the place with the machine.  Fix the machine.  You need something
    that resembles a fan belt(its in your inventory).
14. Leave room and find place where musical skulls are.
15. To find the right tune, look in the grail diary. Just figure out which notes
    are high and low.
16. After door opens, find room with statues. Use grail diary to find the right
    statue combination. Once door opens you are on your way to the room with the
    casket.  This is tricky because ther are many paths to take but they are
    all dead ends only one leads to the casket.  We will let you find it!
17. Once you have found the casket open it. Then leave by means of the gate.
    The gate is locked but you can EASLIY open it since it is RUSTED. (hint).
18. Go out through the manhole and you are on you way to the castle.


THE CASTLE

HINT : While in the castle you will encounter many NAZI guards. Try your best
       NOT to FIGHT. This only decreases your energy. However sometimes
       fighting is your only solution.

1. Go to hallway that is at the top of screen.
2. Find room with drunken guard and CHAT with him. If you use the correct
   dialogs this guard will give you A LOT of infomation.
3. Once finished with guard, go to room with food.
4. Get roast boar, you have to pour ale on the coals to get it. If you talked
   to the first guard correctly you should be able to figure out how to get the
   ale to the hot coals.
5. Go back to lobby and go to hallway to the bottom right.
6. Go straight down to another hallway. The guard will stop you. Try to use the
   best dialog to con your way past him.
7. Find room with clothes, and get servant uniform.
8. Go back to hallway and go to second floor. However you will encounter another
   guard before the stairs.  Try to CHAT with him. (He likes leather:) )
9. Once on the second floor find room with chest and look inside. DO NOT GO
   INTO THE OTHER ROOM.  Just go back to hallway.
10. Walk through hallway until you reach guard. Give guard painting and watch
    what happens. [ Make sure you are in the servants uniform]
11. Go around corner and find key in the room. This key will allow you to open
    the lock that is securing the grey uniform on the first floor.
12. After getting uniform, go back to second floor and find room with security
    system. If you talked to the drucken gaurd correctly you will find out how
    to get past the guard without fighting him.
13. Screw with the security system.  You want to put it out of commission.
14. Now find room with first aid kit.  To get past guard you need CHAT with him
    and get the correct dialog combination. If you end up fighting him you will
    lose, he is pretty tough.
15. Now go to the third floor and find the room where the file cabinets are.
    It is the first room. In this roon the dog will be there. He will not let
    you pass unless you give him something.(Lets just say he is hungry)
16. Go to the filing cabinet and get the combination.  There is also something
    else here that is valuable to enable to pass through the castle. YOU can
    find it on your own.
17. Now leave the room and try to get past the guard by CHATTING. Now go back
    to the second floor to the painting room.
18. Walk to the Mona Lisa painting and open the vault(its behind the painting)
19. Look at both painting in vault. There is vital infomation that will help
    you pick the grail at the end.
20. Go back to third floor. Find BIFF THE GUARD. You need to use the hints
    that the druken gaurd gave you if you CHATTED with him correctly.
    Hint : You will need a lot a ale.
21. After getting past Biff, go downward and CHAT your way past the next gaurd.
22. Now find key hanging on the lamp, search each room to find valuable items.
    One room will have Henery in it. Rescue him.
23. When you leave the room you will get captured. You can do two things.
             A) Give lady the real grail diary
             B) Give her the copy you hopefully found in the chest at home.
   -If you give her real grail diary you will have to go to Berlin to recover
    it.
   -If you give the copy then you will go straight to the airport.
24. Now you are tied up in the room with the fireplace.  YOU can figure out
    how to get out of the ropes.
25. After getting out of the ropes push the statue to reveal a secret passage.
26. Go to motorcycle and leave. You will arrive in either Berlin or the airport
    according to which book you gave the lady.

BERLIN

 In Berlin you will have to meet Hitler, if you have seen the movie you can
figure out what to do, if not tough shit.

AIRPORT

  At the airport you can aquire the tickets to the Zepplin by using teamwork.
Or you can just steal a Bi-Plane and fly to your destination. However you
need the book from the libary to figure out how to fly the plane.  We chose
the plane over the Zepplin because it was easier.  Once in flight try to shoot
down as many planes as possible. Hint: Start at top left and drift towards the
bottom right. For every 3 planes you shoot down you get past 1 checkpoint.
You will eventually crash or run out of gas. Just steal the car.

  To get past the Zepplin you must use teamwork of INDY and the father to
decieve the radio man behind the locked door. Thats all we know.


CHECKPOINTS

  The checkpoints are really hard. There are many dialogs that you have to use
to get past the gaurds. However, each guard has its own weakness.  It will take
too long to list all the correct dialog paths. So if you need the correct ones
just contact us.

1. To the guards that say " Please get out of that expensive looking car"
   There are three thing you can do:
                                    1)Bribe him
                                    2)Punch him
                          The third one you can figure out yourself since it
                        works for EVERY check point.

2.  After checkpoints you are now ready to find The Grail


THE TEMPLE

  In the temple you will have to pass the three tests. These will be hard if
you do not have the Grail Diary that is printed up when you buy the game.
Also your dad gets shot and it is a race against time.


TEST #1 - "The breathe of God, only the penitent man will pass"

  At this test there is a dot on the ground. Its small so you have to look
carefully. You need to stand on the dot. Watch what happens!

TEST #2 - "The word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed."

   Walk on the letters that it tells you when you enter the screen. If you step
on a letter that is not in the name you DIE. So be very careful!

TEST #3 - "The path of God; only in the leap from the lions head will he prove
           his worth"

   You will have to think about this one.  You will just have to have FAITH
 in GOD on this one :)



PICKING THE HOLY GRAIL

   Use the hints that you got from the incriptions from the caves and the
infomation you got from the vault. You WILL be able to pick the correct Grail


After the little cartoon look into the cracked seal and use the whip with the
grail.  DO NOT BE GREEDY!


That's all !  Hope you have enjoyed this awsome adventure by Lucasfilm.
Hopefully there will be more games like this one.  If you need any more details
on some of the hints then just contact one of us.  Remember if you are having
difficulties with the cracked version just get INDY3CHK.ZIP at a BBS near you.
It is the complete translation table to the doc check.

Enjoy!

   OK, to start off with, 'The Insti-
tute' is the type of adventure where
you do a lot of dashing from point 'A',
to point 'C', maybe a quick stop-off at point 'B', then back again.  This means, that there are a lot of moves required to solve this adventure (around 325). So since you can only save one game per disk, I suggest that you take the files "VENSAV" and "VENLOD", and place them on a few other disks so that you will be able to save more then one game.

   Next, I'd like to point out that there are also a lot of moves that you
would not need to do if you wanted to
go a bit more faster through the solve.
So, I have included an asterisk (one of
these "*") in front of these moves.
When you see one of these, you can either ignore it, or follow, but, if
there are more then one them in a row,
don't start in the middle or you'll 
find something won't work.

   You should follow everything in
brackets, and in parenthesis are comments or extra directions I might make.

     If your into Norse Mythology then the game Dusk of the Gods by
Interstel is the game for you.  You are a brave warrior who, having
fallen in battle, finds yourself transported to Valhoil by the
choosers of the slain, the Valkyries.  There you are brought before
Odin the All-Father who bestows upon you a truly daunting quest. 
It is your duty to travel to all of the lands of man, giant, elf
and god in order to discover ways to make sure the forces of Angard
win the battle of Ragnarok, the end of the world.  To
accomplish this you will travel for and wide slaying evil beasts
and recovering fabulous treasures.
     Not all of the quests you will undertake will be to aid the
Asgard.  Some must be accomplished in order to obtain weapons and
items that will help you during your adventure.  Don't forget that
information can be the most valuable treasure;  talk to everybody
that you can and take notes on what they tell you.  Occasionally,
one of the people that you encounter will tell you to ask someone
else about a about a "keyword" item.  Write this down and be sure
to ask that person next time.
     Starting off, you can choose to create a character or choose
from pre-made characters that come w/ the game.  The pre-made are
generally specialized but are rounded enough not to be at an
extreme disadvantage during the game.  However, nothing beats a
home-made hero, so you may prefer to create you own.  The creation
process takes place during your character's life and the choices
you make represent the ones made before the beginning of you quest.

Time passes in real time during the creation, so stopping to make
decisions wastes the time you have to develop the character.  It
also takes time to travel from one place to another so try to visit
locations closer to the icon representing your character.  Once
you've finished the creations process, name your hero and start the
game.
     You start out in Asgard in the chambers of Odin.  He will give
you an overview of your quest and your first task. You will have to
find six items: a mountain's root, a cat's footfall, the spittle of
birds, a bear' sinews, a womans beard and the breath of fish, which
will allow the smith Thjasse-Volund to forge fetters to forever
bind the mighty Fenrir Wolf.  Before you begin this search you must
first equip yourself, for one ill-prepared for his journey will not
travel far.  Leave the main building by the west exit and go south
where you will find another small building.  There inghen will give
you boots, a spear and a torch.  With the spear in hand go west to
where there are several warriors in a partially enclosed area.  The
warrior standing near the entrance will ask you to join in on their
training exercises; this is your signal to hack away.  After
killing one of the warriors you will be able to obtain his broad
axe and can use both it and your spear against the next opponent. 
Pick up his axe also, and nw you are ready for some real opponents.

Finish off the last tow warriors and you will be ready to go get
the first item to forge the chains.
     By talking to all of the people in Asgard you will discover
the location of a bear from which you can get the sinews.  You
should kill the wolves too, for the experience and to possibly
increase you warrior skill.  If at any time you find your opponents
too though you can go visit Eil to have your wounds healed.  You
can also go see Hlif for a blessing of protection.  Both are found
northwest of the western entrance to the main hall.  You can also
get you torches blessed by Bjort while visiting Hlif.  If during
your adventure you discover yourself becoming encumbered, look for
and easy-to-find location and dump all of your items that are not
immediately useful - you can always come back to them later.
     By talking to Lady Sif, Sindre and Thor, you will find out
about the terrible fate of Thor's Hammer, Mjolinir.  During a
battle on Midgard the head was split asunder from the haft and fell
upon the battle ground.  UIn order to retieive the head you will
have to travel to Midgard.  Use the north passage out of the cave
and travel southeast to the battlefield.  Look for the large stone
with the face, this is a landvoettir,  and earth spirit.  He
witnessed the battle and revovered the hammer and is quite willing
to part with it for your secrecy.  Give the hammer head to Sindre
and he will reforge Mjollnir.
     Return to Midgard using the south passage this time and go
northwest to find the hold of King Nitheri.  He will tell you of
the kidnapping of his daughter by the giant Treesmiter, and will
ask you to rescue her.  If you wish you can go north to obtain a
bow and arrows before going to assail the giant, west of the king. 
If unencumbered, you will be able to sneak past the majority of
Treesmiter's guards and only have to deal with him.  Killing any of
the giants will allow you to get a stone club which is very heavy
but does 60 points of damage.  YOu decide whether the damage of you
encumbrance is more important to you.  After defeating tresmiter
you will get the key to rescue the princess in the room.  W/ her is
a chest holding the Cloak of Obscurity and the magic sword
Blutgang.  Keep in mind that magic items for the most part have
only limited uses and should not be used unnecessarily.  The
fireball spell of Blutgang is also limited, so use it sparingly.
     Return to King Nitheri and he will give the magic regenerating
shield, Lifegiver, as he promised (use this sparingly). Now if you
travel further west you will come upon the great hall of King
Beowulf where he will ask you to slay a dragon for him. In reutrn
he offers the sword of lightning, Hrunting. You will find the
dragon just south of the hall in the mountains . Be careful
approaching the cave as the dragon will breathe fireballs in a
random pattern. If you get above him and burn down the tree w/ fire
from you sword you will be able to enter his cave and steal hios
hoard.  When you decide to fight himm get between the pillars
directly beneath him and use a patern of moving up, attacking and
retreating to destroy him. Bring the head back to Beowulf and
collect you reward.  If you wish you may speak to the old woman in
a hut and she will give you information on the effects of various
herbs you will encounter during your quest.
     you can now return to the othere part of Midgard through the
tunnel. Speak to the woman in the hut near the cave entrance and
she will direct you to hte hill Lady, Huldre. If you are careful
you will be able to kill her from a distance w/ a wellaimed
fireball from Blutgang. Having slain here go north to the coast and
follow it east until you find a boat, whose captain is Ragnar, the
Storm Raiser. Speak to him using the keyword "father" and he will
give you the Odin Torc (you should have already gotten the Freya
Torc from Huldres' cave).
     These are only a few of the numerous quests you will
undertake. Wresting the chains Ledling and Dromi, which were first
used to bind the Fenrir Wolf, from the warlord Magnus will not be
easy. Nor will stealing the marvelous Mead of Consequence from the
fire giant lord, Surte, fulfilling Odin's promise to the Vanir. Can
you succeed in preventing the forces of Jotunheim from being
victorious at the battle of Ragnarok? The tale is told in the fall

                    Conquests of Camelot Solution
                        By Lord Reagan [EPiC]


     To start out you enter your room and GET PURSE, and CHANGE
CLOTHES. Now leave your room and continue up to passage to the
garden where the queen hangs out. Talk to her. ASK ABOUT FLOWER,
GET FLOWER, ASK ABOUT LANCELOT, and ask her about anything else
she talks about if you want. Now exit the room and continue down
the passage to the next tower where the treasury and Wizards room
are. To get to the wizards room you continue to go forward in the
tower where you see the treasure. The wizards room is that tiny
tower next to the treasury. Enter the treasury and ASK MAN ABOUT
BUNDLES, ASK ABOUT COINS, and ASK ABOUT GEWAIN. GIVE PURSE TO
MAN, GET GOLD, GET SILVER, and GET COPPER. Now GET PURSE back
from the man. Leave the treasury and go into the wizard's room.
In here you TALK TO WIZARD, ASK ABOUT MAP, GLASTONBURY TOR, OT
MOOR. You can also ask a few other things if you want. Now go and
take a look at the map in his room, then READ SCROLL, READ
TRANSLATION. Go to the chest and open it. GET LODESTONE. Now go
down from the wizards room and pass the next tower and do not
leave through the exit, but instead walk past it to the last
tower you have not been to. This is the chapel of the two gods.
Go to each of the alters here and KNEEL. Put a gold coin on each
alter. After you have done that, go the exit you passed earlier
to the courtyard. ASK GUARD ABOUT GALAHAD AND LANCELOT. MOUNT
HORSE and leave the castle.


     Now on the map, the first place you go is to Glastonbury
Tor. You will see a little forest sprite on the screen as you
enter. Give him a copper coin. Now go west and you will see a
poor hunter there. Give the poor hunter a copper coin. Ask him
about lots of people if you want information. You can ask about
Lancelot, Gawain, Mad Monk, Black Knight, and maybe some others.
Give the man a gold coin and he will give you the spear you need.
Now get back on your horse and continue west. You will fight
three boars here. It is real easy. You just press space bar when
the boar is real close. Change the arcade sequence to easy if you
have trouble with it. Now continue on to the next screen. Talk to
the raven. He will ask you if you want to challenge Black Knight,
say YES. Now look at the dead guy by the tree. GET SLEEVE. Now go
to the next screen where you will joust Black Knight. This is
another real easy sequence. Just look where his shield is and
don't hit the shield, instead hit his body. After you unseat him
three times you will win. Go east and free your friend. Draw you
sword and caught the chains with your sword. Talk to him and ask
him questions and then put Gawain on your horse and he will be
taken back to your castle. Now continue on and you will see a
hag. Give the hag the sleeve that you got. This will free her of
the curse. Now save your game. Read the writing on the thing
where the hag was. Now go east. There are a lot of hard riddles
here. This part gave me some trouble. I put down the answers to
some of the questions. Keep restoring and there will be different
questions each time you come. If you get lucky you will get five
questions you know. Here are some of the answers to the
questions. I am using parts of the question here. You should be
able to figure out which question I am talking about.

1. You here me before, you hear me again...   answer is "echo"

2. Sky, feather of a blue jay, water    answers is "blue"

3. follow you around   answer "shadow"

4. look you in eye... never lies   "mirror"

5. young, sweet in the sun, middle ages makes you gay, old makes
it valuable   answer: wine

6. three lives  breaks rock  caresses sky   Answer "water"

7. Carries burden... would break a mans back, leaves silver in
its track     answer "snail"

8. If you break me... if you lose me    answer is "heart"

9. I turn around once, what is out will not get in, I turn around
again, what is in will not get out, what am I   answer is  "key"

(Thanks to Lord Darkness for the answer to riddle #9. I got four
riddles when I was answering the questions during one time and I
needed the fifth. This riddle section was one of the hard parts
of the whole game. You will probably have to restore a lot of
times until you get 5 riddles that you can answer. These nine
answers should help you)


     Now that you have passed the riddle section, you will be
teleported to the center of Tor. Go north and you will see the
monk there. ASK ABOUT GRAIL to him. He will get mad and run
north. Follow him north and if he is not in the screen when you
follow him north, continue west. You will see two illusions of
the monk and one real one. Draw you sword and use space bar to
hit the monks with your sword. This section is very easy. You
shouldn't have any problems at all. After you beat the monks the
servants will say you cannot leave. Look around the ruins for the
alter and put five silver coins on it. The servants will allow
you to go and give you a key. Take this key and look around the
for well which is in the ruins. When you get to the well USE KEY
on the well to unlock the lock on the lid of the well. REMOVE LID
and REACH IN WELL. Once you get the heart from the well, you have
to return to the place where you enter Glastonbury Tor. The
directions back, from the screen with the well are south, east,
west, west, south, east, east. In this screen the sprite will pop
up again. Save your game here just incase he plays a trick on
you. When he asks for copper just go south and you will be back
to the map and ready to continue on to the next scene.

     Now on the map, go to Ot Moor. It will be snowing here. Go
around here till you get to the ice. USE HEART when you get on
the ice. The heart will guide you across the ice. When the heart
is gold you are going in the right direction, and when it is
purple the ice will break and you will fall in. This part is very
hard, even with the heart. Change the speed to slow. Move one
step at a time save your game every few steps. After watching the
color change to purple and the ice breaking, and changing to gold
and the ice not breaking, you should understand how this works.
After a while, you will eventually make it across the ice. You
will see an ice palace here. Go inside and you will see the lady
of the lake. Talk to here. GIVE HEART to her. She will thank you
and give you information. You have to be a good guy now and say
FREE LANCELOT. She will give you a test. Accept the test. You
will need page 7 of the doc file for this part. I have included
page seven of the doc file with this solve. Go refer to it for
this test. I will include some of the answers to the riddles of
the flowers to help you out. If you get to a question you can't
figure out, you will die, so just restore.

1. It alleviates all pain and sorrows...
answer "daffodil"

2. When light is dim and courage fails...
answer "almond blossom"

3. Known to the priest and nun, who natural pleasures to shun...
answer "cornflower"

4. For its sweet sake, you suffer in silence...
answer "forget me not"

5. In time of grief, it gives relief...
answer "poppy"

6. It can be as sweet as the tongue, or vile as a curse...
answer "yellow lily"

7. Surrounded by giants, your worries are few...
answer "buttercup"

                         The message of the Rose:
                             Love is my shield




The language of the flowers. From the earliest days of
civilization, flowers have been given special meanings. For
example, the rose has a long association with love,sexuality and
with many goddesses, the virgin mary, and the science of alchemy.
Not only the flower   itself, but often the color indicated what
significance was attached to it. There are many legends of
flowers springing up where drops of blood or tears fell to the
ground. What follows is a list of flowers and their meanings.

                                          Almond blossom - hope
Anemone - afterthought
Buttercup - memories of childhood
carnation - heart
columbine - folly
yellow chrysanthemum - slighted love
white chrysanthemum - truth
cornflower - celibacy
daffodil - death
forget-me-not - true love
hyacinth - sport, game, or play
white lily - purity
yellow lily - falsehood
orchid - seduction
blue periwinkle - early friendship
white periwinkle - pleasures of memory
red poppy - consolation
scarlet poppy - fantastic extravagance
snowdrop - hope or consolation
sunflower - haughtiness
red tulip - declaration of love
yellow tulip - hopeless love
violet - lust




You only need to answer three, so there is a good chance you will
get a lot of the questions I just listed here. This part should
be a lot easier then that part where they asked five riddles. Now
that you have answered these three riddles, you will be set free
and teleported before the ice. You will not use half of those
flowers listed in the list above. Those are all the flowers
listed on page seven. Now go back west two screens to the map and
go to Southhampton. Talk to the man near the boat. Ask the man
about Galahad and ASK ABOUT PRICES. BUY TRIP TO GAZA. The ticket
to Gaza will cost 3gp's. You probably only have two GP's, so give
two gold pieces and five silver pieces to the man and you will
get your ticket. Now you are off to Gaza.


     When you enter Gaza, you will see a man and boy. They will
both persuade you to go with the. GO WITH BOY. He will take you
to his master. You can ask him questions. Ask Al-Sirat about
stuff like the grail, Galahad, the goddesses, and their
guardians, and other things you feel necessary. Write down the
things he tells you like the names of the goddesses, and symbols.
When you are ready to go to the desert, you will see Jabir again.
Don't hire him, but just continue into the desert. After you come
to the first screen in the desert, go east, south, and east.
Don't drink the water because it is poisonous. Jabir will stand
in your way to go east now, so draw your sword and he will run.
Once Jabir runs, go east and then north. You will see a building
here. Go up the stairs in the south of the screen on to the
platform. Then take the stairs going down from the platform to
the Pool of Siloam. When you get down here, drink from the pool
of siloam. Now go back up and leave this building and go north.
You will get to the Zion gate if you continue going north. You
will see four guards here. Give the one guard you talk to 4
copper pieces. Now go west along the wall until you reach the
Jaffa's gate. A man will ask you to give him all your money. Just
draw you sword. Now enter through the gate. You will be robbed
right when you enter. I found no way to get the money back. Now
that you have no money, go to the man Mohammed who is caring for
your mule. Sell the mule to him and you will have lots of money
again. Mohammed will tell you all the conversions for the money
he gives you. Remember them.


You will not enter a very fun part, the bizarre. This is a real
fun place. You get to go around and make everyone happy. Go
around talking to people if you want. When you find the seeress,
buy the best apple she has for one dinar. She will reveal her
job, and tell you about the apple you have just eaten. Now go
around and make people happy. You will find out that Ibraham (the
textile merchant) needs a veil. Go to the Felafel maker who is
cooking felafels. Buy a felafel and give it to the little boy
next to the felafel stand. Now go to the pottery seller and buy a
mirror from him. Now go to the place where you sold Mohammed your
mule. CALL FOR MARI who lived upstairs. THROW MIRROR to Mari. She
will go back in, so CALL MARI again. Ask for the veil. She will
throw down the veil. Now take the veil back to Ibraham and give
him the veil. He will be happy. Now look for the meat merchant
and buy a sheep piece from him. Take the sheep to the felafel
maker and give her the sheep. You have accomplished another good
deed. Now look for the fish man and talk to him. He will tell you
his problems. Go to the lamp merchant and buy the herbs from him.
Now go back to the smelly fish dude and USE HERBS. You will have
fixed the problem for him and his neighbors. Tariq talks about a
religious relic. Go to the relic guy (Antiquarius Rex) and buy a
relic. He will ask you for a name. Type PETER. Don't worry about
grail he talks about. Now go back to the lamp merchant and give
him the relic. Now buy charcoals from the lamp merchant. Take the
charcoals and give them to the beggar. Now, the lamp merchant
should have gave you a broom when you gave him the relic. Go to
the innkeeper and give him the broom. Enter his inn and stay a
night. Now go back to the screen where you sold Mohammed the
mule. You will see a woman who is crying. Go to the grain dude
and buy grain from him. You should be about broke once you buy
the grain. Take the grain back to the girl and DROP GRAIN. The
birds will come down and you have performed yet another good
deed. You have not passed the test. Go back to the apple lady and
talk to her. She will tell you to go to the house with the
crescent and moon next, so thats is where you go. She will give
you a strength apple. Keep it for later. Now go to the big house
with the star and the crescent. Say no to all your seductions.
Talk to her and then ask her about things such as Galahad, the
grail, and the test. After you ask about the test, she will open
the door for you. Go through the door to take the test. Grab the
docs and look on page 9 and 10. Using pages 9 and 10 and the
symbols that Al Sirat gave you, you can pass this test. Fatima
will tell you if you pass the test. Now go to the Hierophant. The
Hierophant is the old beggar who you have the charcoals to. Talk
to him and ask him to open the catacombs. He will do that and
give you an elixir. To find your way around in the catacombs, use
the lodestone. Now go around the catacombs and look at the
murals. Keep looking around until you find a childs mummy with a
medallion on it. Go to the right of the mummy and use your sword
to get the medallion. Now go to the sarcophagus and read the
inscription on it. Go to the open part of the sarcophagus and get
the golden apple. Now you should easily find Galahad. Give
Galahad the elixir that you got from the Hierophant. You should
get bitten by a rat right now, but don't worry. Just continue on,
but hurry now. Now look around for the statue of Aphrodite. Put
the golden apple in the palm of her hand. To answer Aphrodite's
questions, look on page 9 and 10 of the docs. After you answer
all of her questions, she will give you directions on how to get
out of the catacombs and a dove. Write down all the directions
she gives you. When the secret doors open, use the lodestone
determine which doors to take. The lodestone always points north.
Follow the directions, and then take the stairs out. Don't forget
to take a look at the dead warriors skull.


     Now, when you get to the temple, walk all around the temple
and check it out. When you encounter the Saracen, eat the
strength apple. Put on the helmet that Saracen gives you. Ok now
just fight this guy. Change the difficulty level if you are
having trouble. You shouldn't have much trouble. (If you die of
poison at any time in this whole area, then you have wasted too
much time, so restore to the part where you get bitten and do
everything more quickly) After you beat the Saracen, use the
dove. Follow the dove until Aphrodite appears. Listen to what she
says. Then ask Merlin about the spiral. Now go to the spiral.
When you are facing the spiral on the inside of the temple. Now
move to the left and count the spaces of the remains of the
pillars until you get to the 6th one. Push the 6th pillar, and
voila!!! Now get the grail. The grail will be stolen by a thief
when you get it. Chase the thief down the stairs and into the
alley. He will be trapped in the alley. You can kill the thief or
show mercy to him. Grab the grail and you are done.
Congratulations!!!!!



I hope you had fun. The graphics on this game weren't as good as
some of the previous ones, but I loved it. I hope you did to. If
you are having any trouble, leave a message to me, Lord Reagan,
on The Fatal Society, Instant Replay, Metal Edge, Final Frontier
or Nuclear Wasteland. The next schedules Sierra game is Keeping
up with the Jones. It is schedules to come out this month, so you
should probably expect it around August. heh... If you have any
comments, leave me a message.

 KING'S QUEST IV
      Part 1

KING'S QUEST IV: THE PERILS  OF ROSELLA, by Sierra On-Line,  begins with
an animated sequence to establish the plot.  There is nothing for you to
do but sit back  and watch, so grab  your coffee (pop, or  whatever) and
relax.  As the plot unfolds,  Graham, your father, is taken  gravely ill
and you, Rosella, are naturally  distraught.  What can you do,  what can
you  possibly  do???   As  you  sob  your animated heart out, Genesta, a
beautiful fairy, appears and offers you hope.  There is, she tells  you,
a fruit which can restore your father's health.  Joy of joys!  There  is
a catch to this news (isn't there always?).  Genesta will transport  you
to the land where this fruit may be found, but you will have to find  it
for yourself _and_  (there is always  an "and" in  these games) you  are
asked  to  help  Genesta.   It  seems  that  one Lolotte, Genesta's evil
counterpart, stole Genesta's talisman, leaving the good fairy a scant 24
hours or so to live.  Rosella  is transported to the land of  Tamir, her
royal  gown  exchanged  for  common  peasant  garb.  Here your adventure
begins.  And remember: Save your game often!

 LAY OF THE LAND

The first thing to do is wander around.  Make a crude but useful map  of
the areas most  easily accessed.  Tamir  proper is about  5 screens high
and 6 screens wide.  Going north indefinitely will scroll you around  in
a nice loop.  This is not true of the east-west movements.  On the  east
is that vast ocean,  and on the west  is a high mountain  range.  Get to
know where things are and who  you are likely to find around  the place.
Talk to  the inhabitants,  and generally  search around.   Once you have
that done, you may begin solving the various puzzles in this area.

 PUZZLES OF MAINLAND TAMIR

Watch for birds trying to catch  WORMS.  Get the WORM, as you  will need
it later.  Swimming in the POOL  will startle CUPID and net you  his BOW
AND ARROWS.  You will have two arrows only, and they will be put to good
use later.

Under the STONE BRIDGE you will find a GOLD BALL.  Give the BALL to  the
FROG in the lily pond.  Actually  you end up dropping it, and  the frog,
whom  you  cannot  approach,  will  return  it.   Once he does, kiss him
(yuck).  This will  get you a  GOLD CROWN --  good for turning  yourself
into a frog (and there are times when that will come in handy).

Visit the MANSION.  In the living room you will find a secret passageway
with the obligatory winding stairway.  There's no need to climb it  just
yet, nor is there a need to collect the SHOVEL you find at the bottom of
those stairs at  this time.  Search  the shelves in  the living room  to
find a BOOK (The Complete Works of Shakespeare).

Give the  BOOK to  the MINSTREL  (he was  an _extremely_  bad minstrel).
He'll accept the book, take on  a new profession, and give you  his LUTE
in thanks.  (How rewarding to help someone in such a meaningful way!)

Find PAN.  Pan  will ignore you  because he is  busy playing his  flute.
Play the LUTE and Pan will suddenly find you interesting.  Give the LUTE
to PAN, and he will give you the FLUTE in exchange.

 KING'S QUEST IV
      Part 2

Visit the TREE HOUSE.  Unlike normal tree houses that are built high  in
the branches, this one  is nestled in the  roots.  It's a terrific  mess
inside,  so  CLEAN  HOUSE.   Rosella,  working  her domestic magic, will
trigger the return of  the dwarves\ They will  sit down and share  their
dinner with  Rosella.  Speaking  with them  is not  very informative but
does pass the time.

Once they leave, clean the dishes;  notice that the dwarves have left  a
blue POUCH  on the  table.  The  pouch is  filled with  diamonds (Wow!).
Being very honest, Rosella will want to return the pouch to the dwarves.
TAKE THE POUCH and visit the  MINE.  There are two screens in  the mine,
so make certain that you've moved  to the lower level, all the  way east
into the second  screen near the  diamond pail, and  close to the  dwarf
with a white beard.  Give pouch to dwarf.  He tells you to keep it,  and
gives you a LAMP to boot!

Visit the  PIER.  Walk  all the  way to  the end,  which will  cause the
fisherman to stand and return to his shanty.  Enter the shanty and  give
the diamonds  to the  fisherman.  He  will give  you a  FISHING POLE  in
return.  Return to the  end of the pier,  put the worm on  the pole, and
FISH.  This will, oddly enough, get you a DEAD FISH.

Go to the  Waterfall.  Wear the  crown, and you  turn into a  frog.  You
will  automatically  swim  under  the  waterfall,  where you find a cave
entrance.  There is  a BOARD here  which you can  pick up now  or later.
Entering the cave  (it's very dark)  will reveal a  pile of bones  right
next to the entrance.  Get BONE.   (Watch out for the troll!)  Save  the
rest of this cave for later.

 KING'S QUEST IV
      Part 3

Following the path up the mountains  will get you (via Goon Airways)  to
Lolotte's.  The program runs by itself for a while, during which Lolotte
will eye you with great suspicion and have you thrown into the  dungeon.
Never fear: You'll soon be released and given a quest.  The first  quest
is to get the UNICORN for Lolotte.

Once you're back in Tamir, return to the PIER, and swim@westward.  Watch
out for sharks and avoid the whale.  It's a good idea to save your  game
before crossing the ocean just in case you end up as dinner.  Swim  east
until you reach the  island home of Genesta.   You may wander about  and
become familiar  with the  island if  you like,  but the  only thing  of
importance here is the FEATHER on the beach.

Once you  have found  the feather,  prepare to  swim eastward (save your
game again).  This time you are  looking for that WHALE.  If you  cannot
find him easily,  restore your game  and swim east  again until you  do.
The whale will swallow you, which  normally would not be too great,  but
it does have its compensations.

 INSIDE THE WHALE

Look around.  Look at the mouth, or teeth, or something specific to  get
the description that mentions  the UVULA.  Now take  a good look at  the
tongue.  On the left  hand side of the  tongue you will find  a "row" of
black dots that gradually rise  toward the middle of the  tongue.  Climb
these  carefully  until  Rosella  stands   up  automatically.   Continue
climbing to the right and up until Rosella is directly under the  UVULA.
TICKLE UVULA with FEATHER.  This will cause the whale to laugh and  spit
you out.  You will find yourself  swimming in the ocean, with an  island
to the north.

Swim to the shipwreck island.  On the island there is the bow of a  ship
in which Rosella may stand.  Here she will be able to see (with the  use
of LOOK GROUND) what you cannot  see.  She will pick up a  GOLDEN BRIDLE
(just the thing for a unicorn).  FEED or THROW the FISH to the  PELICAN.
The  pelican  will  drop  a  WHISTLE.   BLOW the WHISTLE, and a friendly
dolphin will come by to give you a safe ride back to the Tamir mainland.

Search among the screens until you spot the unicorn.  Shoot the  unicorn
with one of the arrows.  This will make him your friend.  Put the bridle
on the unicorn,  and RIDE the  unicorn.  The program  will automatically
take you to the Goon Airways Airport and return you to Lolotte.   She'll
send you on a second quest: Find the goose that lays the golden eggs.

Visit your local  OGRE house.  If  you had tried  to get in  before, you
found that the door was always locked -- well, it isn't now!  Go in, and
throw the BONE (the one you got in the cave behind the waterfall) to the
vicious dog.  He  will be delighted  and leave you  alone.  Go upstairs,
and get the AXE.  Come downstairs, and enter the CLOSET.  Do NOT go into
the kitchen unless you wish  to be dinner.  LOOK THROUGH  KEYHOLE.  Keep
doing that until you see the Ogre fall asleep.  Exit the closet, get the
HEN, and move  quickly to the  door.  EXIT as  quickly as possible,  and
keep going until you are safely away from the ogre.

Take the hen to  Lolotte.  She still doesn't  trust you and gives  you a
last quest: Retrieve Pandora's Box.

 KING'S QUEST IV
      Part 4

Now that you have the AXE, go to one of the three "Scary Forest" screens
and chop down  a tree.  This  will get those  trees to behave  properly!
You may now  visit the one  screen in the  5 x 6  screen layout of Tamir
proper that you haven't been able to see until now.  Here you will  find
a SKULL CAVE.  Enter the cave.

Inside are three witches, each  with only one eye socket.   Between them
they have but one glass eye, which they pass amongst themselves.  One of
the witches  will move  out from  the wall  and attempt  -- slowly -- to
catch you.   Avoid her  and watch  the other  two carefully.  Notice how
they pass the eye back and forth  to one another?  As soon as you  think
you have the movement  and timing pretty well  figured out, move in  and
GET THE EYE.  This can be  tricky, so save your game before  you attempt
this.

Once you  have the  EYE, exit  the cave.   Now, re-enter  the cave.  The
witches, who are helpless without the eye, will toss you a SCARAB.   Get
the SCARAB (which  protects you from  the undead), and  throw back their
eye.

 INTERMISSION

Time to do something for yourself:  You remember why you're here in  the
first place?   You know...dying  father?  (Meaningful  pause....)  Good!
Well, let's do something about that, shall we?

Return to  the Waterfall,  become a  frog, and  go behind the waterfall.
Get the board if you haven't already, and get back to that CAVE.   LIGHT
the LANTERN, then save your game!  Enter the cave.  There is a troll  in
here who badly  wants you for  dinner.  We are  going to do  our best to
deny him such a delicious meal.

Move directly across the screen.   Before you move into the  next screen
(and ONLY if the troll has not appeared), save your game.  Move onto the
next screen.   Move almost  all the  way across,  and then  begin moving
down.  Still no troll?   Save!  If you _do_  see the troll, RESTORE  and
try again.  Continue moving down into the next screen.  Save as often as
necessary.

You will not be able  to see well, even with  the light of the lamp,  so
move carefully, saving when needed,  until you find where that  CHASM is
hiding.  PUT  BOARD OVER  CHASM!  Move  directly "right"  over the board
(you'll pick it up automatically).  Move  up one screen and exit to  the
swamp.

Notice in  the swamp  that there  are tufts  of reeds,  grass, whatever,
stretched out  before you,  rather like  skipping stones.   JUMP to move
from one to another.  Do not swim,  do not turn into a frog; just  JUMP.
Move onto the next screen, and you will see the tree with the FRUIT  you
seek for  your father!   JUMP until  you're on  the last  clump of grass
before the little isle.  PUT BOARD  OVER WATER.  You may now cross  onto
the island, but watch out for the COBRA!

PLAY FLUTE.  (Snakes just love flute music!)  Once the snake is charmed,
move in and GET FRUIT!

Having done that, return the way you came, jumping across the swamp  and
through the cave.  It will suddenly get very dark, because this sequence
triggers nightfall!

 KING'S QUEST IV
      Part 5

 INTERMISSION'S OVER -- BACK TO QUEST III!

Oh yes, Pandora's box.  Well, night  is a great time to visit  a haunted
mansion, so why don't you?  Get  the SHOVEL from the secret passage  off
the living room.  You will now  hear and/or see a number of  GHOSTS, one
at a time.  These ghosts' mortal remains are buried in one or the  other
of the graveyards.   Once you have  identified which ghost  it is (baby,
miser, lord, sad  woman, child, etc.)  go to the  appropriate grave, and
dig.  Don't worry about the  zombies; you've got the scarab,  which will
repel each zombie that touches you.

 GRAVE ROBBING AND OTHER HOBBIES

Digging in the right grave will  reveal something that the ghost of  the
moment wants.  Take  the item, and  give it to  the ghost.  Repeat  this
process.  The  small ghost  child will  lead you  up a  ladder into  the
attic.  Once he disappears (you'll  have to go to the  eastern graveyard
screen and  dig up  his toy),  you will  be able  to OPEN  and LOOK in a
CHEST.  There you will find SHEET MUSIC.

Go to the secret passage off of the living room and climb the stairs  to
the tower.  There you  will find an ORGAN.   Sit on the bench,  and PLAY
SHEET  MUSIC.   Having  done  that,  a  drawer will pop open revealing a
SKELETON KEY.

Go to the CRYPT and open it with the SKELETON KEY.  ENTER.  GET THE ROPE
and it'll fall down  to form a ladder.   Go down the ladder  (the scarab
will protect  you from  the mummy),  and take  PANDORA'S BOX.  Return to
Lolotte's!

 YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IN THE MORNING

Lolotte is at last  satisfied that you are  not Genesta's spy.  She  has
agreed to  let you  marry her  son in  the morning.   All your items are
taken away,  and you  are led  to Edgar's  tower bedroom  for the night.
Edgar, who is nicer then he looks, shortly brings you a rose.  GET  ROSE
and LOOK ROSE.  This reveals that a  key is tied to the rose which  will
let you leave the tower.

Carefully climbing down  the tower's winding  stairs, you move  into the
dining room.  There are two exits at the right of the screen.  Take  the
one to the  rear into the  KITCHEN.  Look in  the cupboards to  find all
your items.  Now,  move back into  the dining room,  and take the  front
exit to the right.

This puts you in the throne  room.  Avoid stepping on the rug,  and take
the  exit  to  the  right.   Now  you  are in the east tower.  Climb the
stairs.  Ignore the exit to the left halfway up, and continue to the top
of the tower.  Here you find Lolotte's bedroom.  Unlock the door and  go
in.  Move close  to Lolotte and  SHOOT Lolotte, thus  using Cupid's last
remaining  arrow  to  a  useful  end.   Lolotte dies a spectacular death
(worth replaying at least once).   GET TALISMAN.  Climb down the  stairs
to the first exit on the left.  When the screen changes, you will see  a
hall and a door.  Open the door and enter the storage closet.  GET  HEN,
and GET PANDORA'S BOX, then exit.

Climb down the remaining stairs and leave the castle.  Enter the stables
and OPEN  GATE to  free the  UNICORN.  Once  you are  outside the castle
again, move down the path to return to Tamir proper.

 LET'S LEAVE EVERYTHING TIDY

Return to the CRYPT and drop  PANDORA'S BOX.  Exit the crypt, close  and
LOCK DOOR.  Move back  to the pier, and  swim west to Genesta's  island.
Enter  her  ivory  tower,  and  climb  the  stairs to her bedroom.  GIVE
TALISMAN TO GENESTA.   The program will  take over from  here, finishing
off the story nicely while you enjoy another cup of coffee!

 KING'S QUEST V
     Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 Welcome to Roberta Williams's most fantastic adventure to date: KING'S QUEST V:
ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GO YONDER. This walkthru will aid you in your quest and
bring you to a full 260-point conclusion in this 9.5Mb monster of a game!

 KING'S QUEST V does not pick up from where KING'S QUEST IV ended...well, not
directly, that is. With his health fully restored by the magic fruit brought by
Rosella from Tamir, King Graham leaves Castle Daventry for a leisurely walk into
the beautiful woods surrounding the kingdom. Soon after he sets off on his walk,
the evil wizard Mordack (brother of Manannan...uh-oh!) appears from a cloud of
darkness outside the castle. Mordack casts a horrible spell, and the castle
containing everyone (except Graham) is swallowed by a huge whirlwind, and
carried back to Mordack's fortress. Graham hurries home after feeling the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15019

horrible winds created by Mordack, only to find that there is no home! Graham
looks in stunned disbelief at the hole in the ground where his castle once
stood!

 "What happened?" screams a furious Graham. Then, a voice from a tall Oak tree
bellows "Who-who-who, I know what happened, I saw the whole thing...."

 Your quest, Graham, is to retrieve your castle and family from Mordack, and
destroy him in the process. Why did Mordack do this to begin with? Well, it
seems that your son, Alexander, turned Mordack's brother (Manannan) into a cat
back in KING'S QUEST III. The spell that Alexander cast was irreversible, unless
the caster reversed it, which is why Mordack needed Alexander. The rest of the
family serves as hostages for Mordack to use against Alexander.

 Your only help on this quest will be from Cedric the Owl, and the kingdom's
wizard, Crispin, who is working on a method to defeat Mordack's magic. Crispin's
wand will be your only possession when you begin the game. Cedric will be your
partner in the game, and will follow you _almost_ anywhere (he's a chicken when
it comes to danger). You will notice that this game is different from all the
other games in the KING'S QUEST series due of its lack of a parser. Please read
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15021

your manual about the icons, and what each one does.

 STARTING OUT

 You will start off in front of Crispin's house. You have no need to go in
because you have already spoken to him. You will find that the TRAVEL icon makes
it easier to leave this screen. Click TRAVEL or walk one screen down. As you
enter the screen, you'll see a poisonous snake guarding the path going to the
mountains on the right. In case you missed him, Cedric will warn you of it.
You'll want to go one screen left here, so click TRAVEL on the left-most part of
the path leading left.

 When you enter the next screen, you'll see a very depressed young man sitting
on a stump. Click TALK on him to find out what's wrong. It seems that his love
has been taken away. Another thing for Graham to do; make a mental note: Find
girl. Now, go back to the right (one screen). This time on the snake screen, go
down a screen. You're now on the outskirts of the town of Serenia.

 VISITING SERENIA

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15023

 Enter the peaceful town. While you're here, there are three stores you'll want
visit: the Tailor's, the Shoe Shop, and the Toy Store. Visit the tailor's first;
it's the store just to the right of the alley. Enter the store and talk to the
clerk. Nothing of interest here, except for that nice cloak. It looks quite warm
for cooler travels. You've got nothing to buy it with, Graham, so leave the
store. Now, click LOOK and look at that shiny white pixel (it's small) just
outside the store. It's a Silver coin! Click ACTION and pick it up. Now, go over
to the barrel outside the alley and look in it. A fish? Click ACTION on it to
get it.

 Now that you've got the smelly fish, go to the Shoe Shop (the next store on the
right). Talk to the owners. It seems times are tough and they can't make enough
shoes to stay in business. Another mental note: Save Shoe Shop. Leave the shop
and go to the last shop: the Toy store. Talk to Santa, I mean, the owner.
Nothing big happening in the toy world. In fact, there's nothing here for you
except that nice sled. It looks like fun for boring winter days! Now that you
know what you want, leave the store and the town, and go up one screen, back to
the path with the snake.

 KING'S QUEST V
     Part 2

 TEMPLE

 When you're on the screen with the snake on it, go one screen left, then one
screen up. This is the entrance to the Witch's Forest. You have to go in there
to find out what happened to that young man's fiance. But don't do it now;
you're not prepared for her. Go one screen left and talk to the weeping tree.
She's playing a harp in sorrow because of the witch who took away her heart, and
she's lost her fiance as well (notice any connection)?

 Go down one screen. That gnome has a nice marionette there; I wonder if he'd
give it to you? Ah, well, guess not. But talk to the elderly gnome and he'll be
willing to trade something for it. Go one screen down again. You're now behind
the Swarthy Hog Inn, a real dump. Go one screen left. Look at that tree full of
bees! There should be a bear there bothering them; if there isn't, exit the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15027

screen and come back. Throw the fish you got from the barrel at the bear. He'll
grab it and wander off for lunch. The Bee Queen will thank you and give you a
honey comb as a reward (lucky you!). Grab the stick on the ground and go up one
screen.

 Those ants look busy! There should be a dog there trying to dig up the ant's
house; if he's not there, exit the screen and come back again. Throw the stick
at the dog and he'll run off to chase it (this dog isn't very bright; he gets
lost doing so). The Ant King will thank you and offer his future aid to assist
you on your quest. Go left one screen into the desert brushes.

 Cedric will stay because if his fear of desert bandits. Go down one screen and
left five to arrive at an Oasis. Be sure to drink from it before leaving the
screen. Go left two screens and down one. Look at that skeleton! Grab his boot
(I doubt he'll be needing it). Go left three screens to another Oasis and grab a
drink. Go up three screens, and right two. You'll arrive at the entrance to a
large temple. Drink from that little puddle in front of the rock, and hide
behind the rock until the bandits arrive. Watch the bandits stash their stuff in
the temple with that magic staff. You can try and open the door without the
staff after they leave, but it'll be useless; you'll have to find the bandits'
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15030

hideout to get that staff.

 Go left two screens from the "puddle" screen, and down three. Take a drink, go
down three screens, and left one.

 BANDITS

 You'll arrive at the bandits' hideout but they're all too drunk to notice you!
So, drink from the large container in front of the tents, then enter the small
tent on the right.

 The game may ask you for information from your manual to cast a sleep spell. If
it does, decode the symbols using your KING'S QUEST V manual. Go into the tent,
grab the staff, and get out of there! Drink from the container, go one screen
left, and three up. Have a drink, go three screens up, and two right. Have yet
another drink and go up one screen to the temple's entrance.

 Use the staff to open the door. Way to go, ace: You broke the staff! Oh, well,
enter the temple quickly, grab the brass bottle and gold coin (just to the right
of the door), and get out. If you dally, you'll spend the rest of your life in

     Part 3

 COUNTRYSIDE

 Welcome back to the countryside; it's nice to see Cedric's back with you! By
now, you should be at the gypsy's hut. Pay the man with the gold coin you just
got from the temple, and go in to see the gypsy. She'll give you information on
Mordack's motive for kidnaping your castle and your family. It seems your son
Alexander turned Mordack's brother Manannan into a cat in KING'S QUEST III, and
Mordack wants Alexander to turn him back into his normal ugly self. This is
pretty heavy stuff! The gypsy will also give you a magic amulet to protect you
from magic. Then, she'll kick you out of the hut and let you go about your
business again.

 WITCH

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15034

 Go two screens right, put on the Amulet, and get ready to enter the Witch's
Forest. Cedric will chicken out again and leave you to do the dirty work by
yourself. Enter the forest and follow the left path.

 Should the Witch show up, she'll try and turn you into a frog, but your amulet
will protect you. While she's trying to figure out what's wrong with her spell,
give her the brass bottle from the temple. Her greediness will make her open it,
and the Jinni inside will be released! After 10,000 years of being in a bottle,
he's glad to be out, and he'll stick the Witch in the bottle to take his place.
So much for the Witch! Continue on this path until you arrive at the Witch's
house. Enter the house (the game may ask you for the codes).

 What a decorator that Witch was! Open the chest and grab the spinning wheel.
Then, get the key from the incense burner hanging from the ceiling. Open the
drawer on the left, get the pouch, exit the house, and go right. Follow the path
until you arrive at an odd-looking tree. Unlock the safe in the tree with the
Witch's key and take the gold heart. This must be the weeping tree's heart!
Let's get out of here and give it to her. Leave the forest.

 Uh-oh, you seem to be lost! Don't worry, though. Go one screen left from the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15037

Witch's house. See those eyes in the background? One pair must know the way out
of here!

 Use the honeycomb and spill a puddle of honey onto the ground. Then, go into
your inventory, change the icon to the LOOK icon, and click on the pouch. There
are three emeralds in the pouch! Throw an emerald: A little dwarf will run out,
grab it, and dive back into the darkness. Throw another emerald: He'll grab it
and leave again. Now, throw the last emerald. This time when he runs out to grab
it, he'll get caught in the honey; grab him!

 Make him tell you how to get out of the forest. He'll agree, lead you out of
the forest, and give you special Dwarf shoes as a gift for the emeralds (I don't
know; I think Graham got ripped-off!).

 You'll crawl out from under a rock and be outside the forest again where you'll
find Cedric waiting for you. Go one screen left, and give the heart to the tree.
The tree will be turned back into a beautiful bride, the lucky groom will show
up, and take her off to the ceremonies. She'll leave her harp there, so take it.

 Go left one screen. The gypsy's gone, but she left a tambourine behind. Pick it
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15039

up, go one screen right, and one down. Give the spinning wheel to the elderly
Gnome and he'll give you the marionette in exchange for you returning his stolen
spinning wheel. Leave him and go down one screen.

 Search the haystack. The ants will show up and help you search it in return for
saving their house. They'll pull out a golden needle and give it to you. Walk
along the path in front of the inn in an easterly direction. When you're near
the edge of the screen, a cat should come running along chasing a rat. If he
doesn't show up, exit the screen and come back.

 You only get one shot at this: Throw the boot at the cat. If you hit him, the
cat will wander off, and the rat will offer you important future assistance in
your quest. Go one screen right, enter the bakery, and buy a pie for a silver
coin. Leave and go two screens left into town.

 BACK TO SERENIA

 First, go into the Tailor's Shop and give him his golden needle. As a reward,
he'll give you the cloak. Then, go to the Toy Shop and give the marionette to
the store owner. He'll be so in awe of its craftsmanship, he'll give you the

CompuServe TEG-15041

sled in return. Finally, go to the Shoe Shop and give the man the Dwarf shoes.
With the shoes he'll be rich and will be able to retire from the shoe business.
In his haste to enter into retirement, he and his wife will leave a hammer on
the counter. Take it, leave the store, and go back to the Inn.

 Enter the Inn and try to talk to one of the men. He'll knock you out, tie you
up, and throw you in the basement. If you saved the rat, it'll show up and gnaw
through the rope. (If you didn't, you're stuck!)

 After the rat leaves, take the rope, and use the hammer on the padlock on the
door. Open the door, grab the leg of lamb from the cupboard, and exit to the
left. You'll exit through the side door and end up beside the haystack. Go back
to the screen with the snake on it. Use the tambourine to scare off the snake.
You're now free to venture into the mountains!

 MOUNTAINS

 After getting rid of the snake, follow the path into the mountains. After a few
hours, you'll arrive near the top. Wear the cloak for warmth, and if Graham gets
hungry, nibble on the leg of lamb. Follow the path to the frozen waterfall,
throw the rope onto the ROCK ledge which is jutting out, and climb the rope to
the top.

 At the top, you'll notice several stepping stones. Save the game, and click
ACTION on the first stone; repeat these two steps until you're across. (You'll
find many stones are loose, and you'll fall, but that's what a saved game's for,
right?)

screen to the right; a wolf will grab Cedric and run off (no big loss). Use the
sled and jump the gorge (the landing will wreck the sled). Get up and follow the
path. You'll come across a hungry Eagle. Feed him the rest of the lamb. He'll
fly off full, and happy, and in your debt.

 Follow the path until the wolves capture you. They will take you to the Ice
Queen who has captured Cedric, as well. She'll pronounce your sentence, and ask
if you have any last words: Play the Harp. The Queen -- a real music lover --
will spare your life, and make a proposal to you: Clear her beautiful crystal
cave of the Yeti that has taken up lodgings in it, and she'll set both you and
Cedric free (you have to agree). One of the wolves will lead you to the Yeti's
cave. Walk up to the cave, and when the Yeti shows up, throw the pie at him!
It'll hit him square in the face, and he'll slip off the cliff. Don't leave just
yet, though. Go into the cave and use the hammer to get a large crystal from the
cave wall.

 Now, go back to the wolf, and he'll take you back to the Queen. The Queen will
let Cedric out of his cage, and both of you will be free to go. Follow the path
until you arrive at the flowing ice river. Walk to the huge cliff at the bottom
of the screen, then climb the "tunnel" that's at the lower left side of the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15046

cliff.

 If you climb the cliff and make it to the top, a roc will grab you and drop you
into the nest for her little rocs to feed on. Grab the locket in the nest and
hope they don't eat you. The eagle you fed will come streaking down from the sky
to your rescue. All the roc will get is your cloak. The eagle will bring you to
safety on a nice warm beach; Cedric will be there waiting for you.

 HERMIT

 Grab the crow bar, and go down the beach until you reach an odd house. When you
ring the bell, a deaf hermit will come out and try to talk to you, but he'll go
back inside because he can't hear anything. If only there was a way for him to
hear you....

 HARPIE ISLAND

 Welcome to the conclusion of KING'S QUEST V: Glad to see you've made it this
far! Now that you've been to the hermit and realized he's more deaf than your
Aunt Agnes, go up two or three screens from the Hermit's house, until you reach
the shipwrecked boat. Click the used beeswax on the boat to patch its little
holes, then hop in the boat and get ready for the high seas.

 You can try to sail the boat yourself in your quest "to get the old guy to
hear," or click ACTION on the boat, go three or four screens right, then one
screen down. If you mess up your navigation at all, Mr. Sea Monster will invite
you to a game of full-contact water polo.

 When you arrive at the island, get out of the boat. As soon as you get out of
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15050

the boat, the Harpies will grab you and Cedric. Cedric will disappear, but the
Harpies will take you to the summit of the island, and decide who gets your legs
and who gets your arms. Play the harp. The Harpies will be so interested in the
harp, they'll forget about you, and fly off fighting for it.

 Grab the silver fish hook on the ground, then go left one screen. Continue left
until you find Cedric on the ground. Poor Cedric: The harpies hurt him bad! Pick
him up, and continue left. At the beach, take the shiny shell on the left side
of the beach, and jump in the boat. Once you're back on the high seas, go left
until you arrive back at the Hermit's beach.

 If you land on a screen other than the one the Hermit's house is on, sail down
one or two screens because you can only take Cedric out of the boat at the
Hermit's house.

 At the Hermit's house, ring the bell. When he comes out, give him the Conch
shell. He'll use it as a hearing aid, and you can now talk to him. He'll take
you and Cedric inside his cozy hideaway, and fix a potion to bring Cedric back
to health. He'll also provide you with a guide to Mordack's castle: a mermaid!
The next thing you know, you'll be following a mermaid into the sunset in your

trusty boat.

 MORDACK'S CASTLE

 A couple of hours later, your guide will leave you on your own, but don't
worry: You'll already be on a crash course with Mordack's Island. SLAM! Your
ship will crash into the Island and become firewood; however, you've made it to
the last leg of your quest: Mordack's Castle. But can you defeat him? Think not?
Read on!

 Grab the dead fish beside the shipwreck, then go up the stairs. This is a good
point to save your game. Keep following the path until you reach two ugly
serpent statues on either side of you. For a laugh, keep walking; otherwise, use
the crystal you took from the Yeti's cave. The beams from the statues will be
reflected back into their own eyes, and destroy them!

 Keep following the path. When you get to the front door, you'll notice that
there is a rather large gap between you and the door. Don't worry, just take a
detour to the left, and follow the ledge around the castle until you reach a
vent. Use the crowbar to open and enter the vent. Cedric will stand guard, and
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15054

you'll drop into Mordack's maze.

 In this maze, you are after two things: the Exit, and a large, blue, bouncing
beast....

 Because of the multiple locations of the beast, I'm afraid I can only offer the
location of the exit of the maze. I recommend you map and explore your way
around until you find the beast; you're going to have to find your way back to
this screen on your own. When you find the beast, use the tambourine. It will
grab it, play with it, do a back-flip, and leave. Take the hairpin it leaves
behind. Now, go back to the screen with the vent above you.

 On the vent screen, make sure there are passages to the north, west, and south
(save your game here). From there, go down one screen, right three, down one,
right three, up one, and right two. You'll arrive at the locked door that leads
out of the maze. Use the hairpin and pick the lock with it. Ta-da...it's open!
Go in and get the bag of dried peas from the cupboard. Then, go up one screen.

 Look at the poor lady scrubbing and cleaning. Give the locket from the roc's
nest to her. She'll be in your debt forever; believe me, you'll need her help!

worry, you'll take him out later; let him lock you up. If he doesn't show up,
exit the screen and retry.

 ENDGAME

 When you get back onto your own feet in the cell, use the fish hook to get the
cheese from the mouse hole in the north wall (save your game). Now, wait until
that poor maiden you gave the locket to shows up and moves a stone to help you
escape from your cell. Quickly leave the cell and follow her back to the
kitchen. From the kitchen, go back to the screen where the blue beast captured
you last time.

 This time when the jail guard comes to take you away, use the dried peas. He'll
slip on them and knock himself out cold. Go one screen left and up the stairs.
At the top of the stairs, go to the left.

 If the cat (Manannan) shows up: Throw the fish at him, then use the empty pea

sack to trap him. He usually shows up in Mordack's Bedroom.

 Once you're in Mordack's bedroom, go one screen down into his lab. Read the
book on the left side of his bench. All you'll see is four odd pictures; in
reality, they're powerful counterspells that you will use to fight Mordack. Once
you've read the book, stand to the left of the doorway, and hide until Mordack
goes to sleep in his bedroom (you can see him through the doorway).

 When Mordack's asleep, go into his bedroom, grab his wand from the night table,
and go one screen left. Once you're out of his bedroom, go one more screen left.
This is Mordack's laboratory. You'll need to fix Crispin's wand quickly before
Mordack awakens.

 Go up the spiral stairs and look at the right-most machine on the top floor.
Notice the two stands? Put Crispin's and Mordack's wands on the stands, then
drop the cheese from the cell into the machine, and step back! ZAP! The machine
will drain Mordack's wand and recharge Crispin's. Uh-oh, Mordack just woke up,
and he looks plenty mad!

 Mordack will appear, use his magic to grab his wand from the machine's stand,

and cast a deadly bolt of energy in your direction. Suddenly, Cedric will come
in a window with news from Crispin and intercept the bolt of evil magic...with
his head! He'll nose-dive into the ground and leave you and Mordack to do
battle. It doesn't take Mordack long to realize his wand is busted, so he'll
have to rely on his own magic. He'll turn into a hideous flying creature.

 When he turns into the flying creature, click the wand on Graham, and turn him
into a tiger. The tiger will best Mordack's creature and take him to the lower
level of the lab. Mordack will then turn into a fire-breathing dragon. Turn
Graham into a rabbit so he can dodge the fire blasts. Now, Mordack turns into a
poisonous snake! Turn Graham into a mongoose to meet Mordack on his own ground.
Finally, Mordack will get careless and turn into a ring of fire and surround
Graham (pretty careles, huh?). Now's your chance: Turn into a rain cloud and put
an end to Mordack's picnic! The rain will quench Mordack for good and end his
tyranny.

 You've done it: You've defeated Mordack! The poor maiden from the kitchen will
enter the room to see what the noise was, and be delighted to learn you've put
out Mordack's fire! She'll also reveal that she is really Princess Cassima
(didn't see that coming, did you?) imprisoned by Mordack. But now, thanks to
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-15062

you, she's free!

 Now, how about your family? Don't worry, Crispin will show up and return your
castle to Daventry, and your family back to family size. He'll also fix up
Cedric back into tip-top shape. Cassima will join you and your family as you
cuddle up and are warped back to your castle by Crispin.

 The ending scene is beautiful, so sit back and enjoy your triumph over the best
PC game ever published!

   Once again, thank you very much for all of your help in
solving King's Quest III.  All of the above helped in one way or
another.  Not all provided valid or even intelligent thoughts to
the solution, and you know who you are!  But if it was not for
the support of the following on the Gallifrey, King's Quest III
would have taken much longer to solve.  Once again thank you and
enjoy this tutorial help guide.

Special Thanks To SPI for cracking King's Quest III.
Special Thanks to Kloey Jr. for his insight and thoughts !!!!!

        This Tutorial is dedicated to my sister, who is now mourning
the death of her pet guinea pig, Max, who left us while I solved
King's Quesy III in the wee hours of the morning.

..............Amen.

"Hot damn!  I beat your ass.........Jesus-H, it is 4:58 AM.  I
will write the tutorial tomorrow night."

   You have just witnessed the past events of December 7....1941,
a day that will live in infamy, whoops, wrong story.  You have
just witness the events of last night or this morning as the case
may be.  I have now sat down, after three hours or so, of
re-writting my maps so that people, other than ostriches, could
read my handwriting.  If you would like a formal map, please
leave e-mail for Kloey Detect on a BBS near you.

   Well, Sierra On-Line topped themselves again.  This is the
best of the King's Quest series yet, as far as the toughness
goes, but I still feel that King's Quest II was more based on fairy
tales and mythology like King's Quest.  Well a different guy
did this one.  Look for King's Quest IV between June and July!!!

OBJECT
<*><*><*>

   You have been captured by the evil homosexual wizard Manannan,
who if you can't tell by the name, probably lives in
Greenwitch Village and skips to work wearing a pink flowing
gown.  You must escape from Manannan, rescue your sister, and
take her back to Daventry in time, or the kingdom will suffer
further ruin and be destroyed, which we would not want to happen!

   Because King's Quest III is so large [actually smaller than
King's Quest II], but a bitch to map, it makes it very difficult
to explain step-by-step how to solve it, so I am going to help
you solve this adventure, but not really:  I will provide the
information necessary to do so, but for those of you who do not
want to take the cheaters way out, you will only get the hints
that you need.

Here we go...................


--------
* NOTE *
--------

        The following maps are the most "conceptual" maps that there
are:  You may be at a poin and go south, when you go north to
return to the beginning, you will not return to the point you
started at, but instead be to the left or right of the starting point.

There is a wrap-around effect in the game and it applies only to
the north/south borders.

* - Magical item which you may not possess while Manannan is
    still in the house, unless you enjoy being killed!

O - Ocean, which you can not swim across completely or defend
    yourself against sharks!

# - Non-accessible area which is between/in the cliffs, chasms,
    walls, mountains, etc.

You have exactly 30 minutes on the game clock in which to either
gather your stuff together and solve the adventure or return to
the house, stash the stuff under your bed (pay attention, clue #1)
and then wait for Manannan to blow off.

   ---Remember to ALWAYS put the wand back when you return home.
--|
|  ---Remember to ALWAYS shut the trap door & move the book back.
|
|
|----------If you do not do this then Manannan will blow you into
                 cocaine dust.

     Just as a brief note: The majority, 99%, of these maps have
been drawn as an overhead/cross-section view, but I guess by now
you have seen that!

     In the following pages you will have the numeric key to the
above maps.  To understand them you must be at least 10 years in
age and be able to read 3 syllable words.  I will list the # of
the map location followed by the description of the location, and
then all the things that should be done on the screen.  Now bear
in mind that you may have to complete certain conditions in order
to perform certain commands.

Example: 666 - Satan's Party Hole
                        [1]Sacrafice virgin
                        [2]Get pitchfork

Comprende !!??!!

                         [*][*][*][*][*][*][*]

Extra Hints:

1] To poison the porridge, place the cookie in it.

2] To get the cat fur: a)Hold cat
                       b)Get fur

3] To stay safe during the journey to Daventry while on the
   Pirate's ship, remain at the rear of the ship untill you reach
   land.  You have to figure it out from there.

4] SAVE YOUR GAME FREQUENTLY!!!!!  I used the following format
   when I saved a game:> 
    
               136/210 : Captn.Room : 1:26:23

      This is the score I have : Location : Time used

5] The eagle will drop the feather randomly, so GET IT !


Before we continue let me just say I finished King's Quest III,
but did NOT have all the points, which I don't give a crap
about.  I attribute the loss in points to the following:

Failure to complete the folowing spells:
----------------------------------------
Understanding the Language of creatures(10 pts)
Causing a deep sleep(10 pts)

Failure to gain the following objects:
--------------------------------------
Reptile skins
Acorns

I needed the above two objects to complete the above two spells,
simple, isn't it!  If you could leave e-mail to me, I would
appreciate it to soothe my desire for knowledge.

Points not listed in Map/Tutorial
---------------------------------

IMPORTANT: When Manannan first appears, he will ask you to go do
                 something, DO IT, you get now points, but then you
                 won't get turned to cocaine either!!

    It took me about 10 hours to complete the thing and to map
it all out and put the above info in a decent order.  I only got
169/210 points, and I have allready discussed why.

    I have only provided you with 80% of the solution.  What I mean
by this is that you must perform certain actions before others
can obviously take place. i.e.:You must open a brew to drink it,
unless you are a conehead, or on a more understandable basis, you
must have the key in order to open the wizard's safe.

        Well....have fun....live long.....and remember to save your
game frequently......and look for King's Quest IV !!!!

                       Search for the King Solution
                             Done by Ice Bird

Note: This soltion only gets you 460/500 points- if anyone figures out how
to get the other 40, please feel free to add it to this file.

 Ok in the beginning you start off in you office, go around behind the desk
and "Open Desk" "Take Lunch" "Take Thermos". Ok, now  go  out in  the hall, 
and "Open Thermos",  walk over to the water fountain and "Fill Thermos with 
Water",  "Close Thermos".   Now walk to the  end of the hall  and into your
Bosses' office.  

 Walk to the front of his desk,  and "Ask About Raise".  This part is kinda
tricky. You have to catch  him looking at Stella's  ass before you are able
to  get the keys (otherwise he "presses a secret button under his desk" and
the game is over).  Keep  pressing  enter until he tells Stella to bring in 
your file,  and wait  for Stella to give  him the  file and turn,  when she 
does,  his eyes will go to look  at her. Type "Get Keys" while he's staring
at her ass.  You will only get  ONE  chance at this  so make sure you do it
right the first time.

 Now you have the keys,  "Ask about Raise",  then leave. Walk down the hall
and  to  the  front of  the door by the  water fountain.  "Unlock door with 
Keys", "Open door"  and go in.  Walk straight to the toolbox (in the middle
of the floor).  "Get ID".  Turn around  and Leave "Close Door".   Now go to 
the Elevator and "Press Button",  enter the elevator,  and you'll  come out 
by the guard.  Now you'll be asked for the "number to the word above"- just
type any NUMBER.  Walk  in front of the guards desk and "Get Dream".   Then
open door, and go outside.  Go off to the left, and  continue 'till you get
to the poster of the circus. Go in between the two  boards and slip inside.

 Once inside you'll  see a  section of black with a white border around it,
and a  break  right between two  trailers (in  the lower left hand corner). 
Walk  to this section,  and you'll  be `zoomed'  in, and see the trailer in 
front of you.  Walk to the front  of  the trailer and "Knock Door", as soon
as the colonel comes to the door "Ask for Job", and give him time to finish
telling  you about  your job,  and  shut the door before leaving, or you'll 
have to do it all again.

 Walk over to the elephants  and  "Get Shovel",  then  after  about  1 or 2 
shovels full of elephant dip, type "Drop Shovel".  Walk back to the trailer
and "Knock Door" again, "Take Ticket". Walk back between the breaks  in the
border,  and you'll be returned to the overhead view.   Walk to  the  gypsy 
wagon (this is right beside  the clown  juggling the balls).  Walk  to  the 
front and type "Look"  this will zoom you in,  and then you can walk up the 
steps using the PgUp (9) and the right arrow, and eventually an Up arrow to 
get you in.  Once inside  "Touch Woman",  she'll  disappear,  "Pet Lizard",
"Get Card", "Get Wax", and "Leave".

 Now that  you  have  that stuff,  walk  over to  the Strong  man, and type 
"Look", you'll get a close up, and  see Luigi sitting bent over.  Walk over
in front of him and "Give Wax".  When he  ets the weights up, "Take Rosin".
Now walk off the screen, and you'll get the overhead view again.  Walk over
to the 'Test-O-Strength'  machine (Right in front of the Big Top), and type
look,  you'll  see a Popcorn  Machine,  walk  to  the  front  and type "Get 
Popcorn",  then walk into the Big Top at the top left corner of the screen.

You'll be confronted by a Lion licking his lips and thinking that you are a
steak. "Get Jar from Bag" "Open Jar","Drop Jar", and he'll  lick the peanut
butter.  Now walk  to the right  and you'll see  Frederick Von Leepov (leap
off).  Walk to the front of Fred and "Give Rosin". He'll take it, climb the
ladder,  and miss terribly.  "Take Cape",  and walk to the left and off the 
screen,  and in front of the Lion.  "Drop Popcorn", "Get Jar", walk off the 
screen to the left. Sometimes it doesn't like you going to the left, so you
have to walk forward (towards the screen) to make him get out.

 Now that we have all of  that stuff,  walk over behind Luigi (Strong Man),
and right  beside  the Fat Lady,  and type  look.  You will see Helmut Bean 
`The World's  Smallest  Man'.   Walk to  the front  of his booth, and "Give 
Dream to Helmut", "Take Helmut". At his point, we you are all done with the
Circus, so leave out the front gate by the ticket booths.

 Keep walking to the right (from the Circus) 'till you come out in front of
a house, go up the steps, and  "Knock Door",  wait for her to say something
then "Show ID",  and she'll let you in.  Go the the sofa and "Sit on Sofa",
"Ask for Soda", "Show Scarf", "Spill Soda on Scarf". She's gonna get PISSED

come back to the  fence and "Climb Fence".   Go back  to the left 'till you 
get  to  the  Bus  Depot  again.  Walk to the `mailing'  position and "Open

Casion Hotel.  Walk up the Steps, and use the same `wiggle'  technique that 
you used to get into the gypsy wagon.  

 This will put you in the lobby,  walk to the front counter,  and "Page Mr.
Fabulous", the guy will do it,  and you need to go up to the next room, and
then left to the Pool.  Continue  left 'till  you  see a woman sitting in a 
Chair, and an empty chair to her left. Walk to the  front of the chair, and
"Sit in Chair".  You  will get to see her.   She'll get you gassed up,  and 
then get up,  and  jump in the pool.  When  this happens, "Get Glasses". Go

break between buildings on the right side of the street.  walk through, and

both a phone  and restrooms,  and is towards  the top.  There  is  a  small 
building  beside  it on the bottom.  You  want to  walk between  them,  and 
you'll get a close up of Red's Bar.  Walk to the front, and go in the Phone
booth, and  "Wear Suit".  When  you  come out,  walk to the front door, and 
"Open Door", and go in.  Once  on stage "Sing".  You'll do a nice rendition
of `The Pee Wee Herman', and win a free pass to 'The Kingdom'.  Leave here,
and go back to  the  kingdom  gates which are on the left of the road. Once
inside go to  the front of  the big house  with the  attraction  symbol out 
front.  Walk up the front steps and you are inside.

ropes so that you can get to the stuff. "Get Microphone", "Get Guitar", and
walk back to the left,  and go into the kitchen.  (Top Left Room).  Walk to
the back side of the Table,  and "Get Banana".  Walk  back  into the Living 
room, and go up the steps.  At the top of the steps, go left, and it'll put

back of it and  "Slide down Kingpole".  Once at  the  bottom  type "Release 
Kingpole".  Walk to the back right side  of the bar and "Open  Counter", go
through and "Close Counter",  walk to where  you are beching the clear spot 
on the counter (No Bottles or Napkins), and "Get Bread".  Once you have the
bread, go to the spot in the counter where  you can in and "Make Sandwich".
This will make  you  fat and look like Elvis..er..The King. "Open Counter",
and come out,  and go to  the door  on the  Right  of the  screen and "Open 
Door",  and go through the door.  From here you are  through in  the House.

 Leave the house  (which  usually  means that you have to walk  towards the 
screen and you'll get the overhead view of  you again).   Got  out onto the 
street,  and  go  back  to  Red's.  "Open Door",  and go in.  Hang  on  one 
command left!! "Sing".  You'll get trampled by  adoring fans,  but you have 
the resurrection  card that you got from the Gypsy, so you are okay. You'll
be brought back to life, and see the ending.

                  KING'S QUEST III HINT


To play King's Quest III effectively you have to have and 
know how to use every magic spells.  The only place you 
can make these magic spells is in the Wiward's laboratory.

To get to the Wizard's lab, go to his room and move a book 
on the shelf and then pull the lever behind the book.  
There will be a stair leading down to the lab, becareful!

You can not successfully compose the magic spells with the 
Wizard around the house.  Wait until he takes a nap or 
goes on a trip.  He is usually gone approximately twenty 
five minutes (on the IBM-PC clock speed).  This allow you  
just enough time to get the mirror, the rose essence, the 
tin cup in the house; go down to the country side to get 
the required ingredients; and come back to the Wizard's 
lab to make these seven spells.  Once finished making the 
spells, hide it under the bed; otherwise the Wizard will 
kill you when he finds you carrying these forbidden 
(starred) stuffs.

You can get rid of the Wizard forever by turning him into 
a black cat (a different one).  Break the "Cat Cookie" 
into little pieces and hide it in the porridge bowl.  
Given the Wizard the poisoned porridge when he asks for 
some thing to eat.  

To get the cat fur, kick the cat, take it in your hand and 
pluck its fur (you might have to try this several times to 
succeed).  To get the dog hair, pet the dog.  To get the 
chicken feather, cacth the chicken then pluck the feather. 

To get the eagle feather watch for the flying eagle across 
your screen while in the country side, the eagle sometimes 
will drops its tail feather once.

To kill the spider, transform into an eagle and watch what 
happen.  To kill Medusa the hag, use the mirror while 
hiding behind the big rock in the desert - show mirror to 
Medusa (You might have to try this several time).  The 
cactus is right beside the big rock.  To get mud, use the 
spoon you got from the kitchen.

If you get robbed by the bandits, don't worry because you 
can get it back.  Go to the large oak tree on the edge of 
the desert.  Reach inside the hole at the base of the tree 
for a lader.  Climb up to the bandits' shack and get the 
gold coins and your stuff back, but becareful!  Use these 
gold coins to buy the ingredients from the store and buy 
the ship passage from the captain in the tavern.  Don't 
forget to kiss the barmaid, she is a knock-out.

Once on the ship, go to the other room to find a small box 
(listen to what the mouse on the ship said).  Put the 
small box on top of the large crate and jump to lader.  
Before that, wait until you hear the sailors shout "Land 
ho..." then cast the sleeping spell on the other room 
floor.  Climb the ladder and go to the captain bin to get 
your possession back.  Jump off the ship to get ashore, 
watch for sharks!  To get pass the snow man use one of 
your magic tricks.  To kill the dragon, use your magic.

There are seven magic spells which you can cast on 
somebody else or use it on yourself.  Whichever spell you 
use, make sure you follow exactly the given directions; 
even a wrong step or a misspell immediately means death.  
So, pay close attention to these spells.

          King's Quest IV Perils of Rosella
          ---------------------------------


               Written by  Lord Zombie

The First thing you should do is read through the entire document
and look what you need help with... If you just got King's Quest
IV and the hint file then read this and do it in order.

     
You start out standing by the seashore.  From here walk into the
forest and find the dwarf's house, it is built under a tree.
Walk into the dwarf's house and type 'CLEAN HOUSE'. After
cleaning the house the dwarfs will pile in and eat dinner, after
you are seated in the chair eating with the dwarfs, type 'TALK TO
DWARF'. Keep doing to this until they don't talk back. After they
leave walk to the pouch and pick it up, walk south from the house
and into the mine, walk to the dwarf with the lamp and type 'GIVE
POUCH TO DWARF'. Now leave the mine and go to the fisherman. Wait
till he gets up and goes in to his house. Enter the house and
give the diamonds to the man.  Leave hear and go to the house,
the old mansion, walk in there, go west to the living room and
type 'GET BOOK'. Now type 'LOOK AT PICTURE' then 'LOOK AT WALL'
then 'PULL LATCH'. Walk through the secret door you opened and
get the shovel, don't worry about the stairs yet. Now go where
the bridge is, the one with the odd looking tree next to it.  Go
to the left side and type 'LOOK UNDER BRIDGE'.  You should pick
up a gold ball.  Now off to the swamp with the frog in it. Stand
behind the shrubs to the north of the swamp and type 'GIVE BALL
TO FROG'.  Walk over to the point where the frog is, then get the
frog and kiss it.  Now you have to find the worm, it is located
west of Lolotte's Castle. There should be a bird pecking at the
ground, just walk near it and it will fly away, then get the
worm, now would be a good time to talk to Lolotte.  To talk to
her just go all the way to the east side of the game, one screen
below the waterfall.  Just walk up the path. Now we are gonna go
north from where the goons dropped you off, you should be at the
waterfall. Just 'WEAR CROWN' near the waterfall and you will
appear behind it. Now walk up to the board and get it. Now be
REAL careful and walk into the cave. Don't take a step after you
are in just type 'GET BONE' then leave, to leave just swim out. 
Now go to the pool, the one with the pillars, and just keep
leaving and coming back until the cupid shows up, now all you
have to do is walk into the pool and the cupid will fly away,
then walk to the side of the pool and get his bow.  Now you are
off to find the unicorn, when you find him stop immediately and
'SHOOT UNICORN', this will make him like you.  Now we find the
minstrel, not Pan, the minstrel, he sits on a rock or stump, when
you do find him give him the book, he will give you his lute. 
Now find Pan, the dancing guy that plays the flute, when you find
him play the lute then give it to him, this will give you the
flute. Ok, now we go fishing, walk out to the pier and 'BAIT
POLE', now 'FISH' until you catch a fish. After you have caught
the fish then jump off the pier and swim westward until you hit
Genesta's Island. Walk around the island until you find a
peacock's feather. After you find this feather then walk back to
where you got on the island then go off the screen to the right,
from here go directly south, now east back to the pier, if you
don't get caught by the whale then go back west. You will get
caught by the whale soon enough. After being caught walk to the
left side of the tongue and walk up the tongue diagnolly, this is
very hard to do, so I suggest you save the game every half inch
or so. After you reach the top then walk up to the uvula, the big
bag like thing and 'TICKLE UVULA'. That should put you right out
near the island, swim north. After reaching the sand stop and
'THROW FISH TO PELICAN', then walk over and get the whistle. Now
walk into the bow of the ship on the right and 'LOOK ON GROUND'.
This will get you the bridle.  Blow the whistle and mount the
dolphin.  After you have reached the mainland find the unicorn
walk up to him and 'BRIDLE UNICORN'. Now mount the unicorn. You
should have talked to Lolotte again, and told to bring her the
magic hen. Walk to the ogre's house, the one with the thatched
roof. When you get there the ogre's wife will be there, just run
away and go back. Walk to the door and open it then 'GIVE BONE TO
DOG'.  Now we go up the stairs and get the axe. Ignore the door
in the bedroom. Go back downstairs and open the door there, you
should be in the closet. Wait for it to say that the ogre is
home, when it says this type 'LOOK THROUGH KEYHOLE. Ok, now out
the door and get the hen, this should not be a problem. Now out
the door and off the screen. From here go to the man eating
forest and 'USE AXE ON TREE', now you are free to roam around
through the trees.  Go bring the good old hen to Lolotte. Now we
set off for the fruit and Pandora's Box. Go behind the man eating
forest to the skull house, enter, and let the witch chase you
around until you are far away from her. The proceed right in
between the two stationary witches and 'GET EYE', now leave, go
back and 'THROW EYE TO WITCH', now get the scarab. Ok, go to the
cave behind the waterfall and enter the cave. Turn on your lamp,
then go south, if you are not eaten by the troll then  save, east
again, save, you should be at a point where there is a little
light in the corner. When you get here walk about two inches and
'PUT BOARD OVER CHASM', if it says you are not close enough then
take a step then try again until you are across. From here go
north then out the hole.  Walk to the nearest lilypad and 'JUMP'.
Keep jumping until you arrive on the last pad before the island.
'PLAY FLUTE' and 'PUT BOARD OVER SWAMP'. Now cross the board and
wait until the cobra wakes up then play the flute again, you are
now free to get the magic fruit, now return but don't forget the
board!! To leave the cave do the same thing with the chasm and
the troll.  It will be night when you return. Now you go to the
mansion and you will find a baby crying, actually you will here a
baby crying.  Go out into the graveyard and find the gravestone
with the description of the baby on it and dig, if you don't find
something like a rattle, restore becasue you can only dig five
times until the shovel breaks, and there is five different
ghosts.  Ok, this is a big pain now, you have to find the certain
object for the certain ghost, just read the gravestones and find
the descriptiom that best fits the ghost you are looking for.  I
can not help you on the whereabouts of the gravestones.  After
you have done this, you will have access to the trapdoor in the
bedroom ceiling.  After you give the toy to the little boy, open
the chest and get the sheet music.  Walk up the stairs in the
secret passage to the organ room and 'PLAY SHEET MUSIC'. This
will open up a drawer in the organ that contains the key to the
crypt.  Walk down to the crypt and unlock it. Enter and 'GET
ROPE'. Then 'CLIMB', don't worry about the mummy, he will run
away, just get the box and go to Lolotte.  Lolotte tells you that
you are to marry Edgar tomorrow. You are sent up to Edgars room
to sleep for the night.  Edgar will give you a rose and look at
the rose. Alas! it has a key, get the key and unlock your door. 
Proceed down the stairs carefully. There is no trick to avoiding
the guards, you just walk around them real carefully. After
reaching the bottom of the steps you walk right and hit the
dining room.  There are two exits here, take the one in the back
near the guard, be careful walking past the guard.  After you are
in the kitchen open the left cabinet and 'GET ALL'.  Ok, walk
out, and again be careful, then take the other right exit, walk
through to the right, then ALL THE WAY UP THE STAIRS. Do not stop
off at the side yet.  When you reach the top unlock the door with
the gold key and enter walk over and 'SHOOT LOLOTTE' and after
the big talk 'GET TALISMAN'. Now downstairs and off to the side
where you will find all the guards gathered. From there walk to
the north into the storage room and get the hen and Pandora's
box. Proceed to the entrance, the throne room.  After leaving the
castle enter the stable and walk in between the two stalls and
'OPEN STALL GATE'.  Now you are off to Genesta's Island. After
you are in her bedroom 'GIVE TALISMAN TO GENESTA'........

Hints and Solve for Kings Quest V

Now where is the game?! - Freedom Fighter

Problem:
What do I do in the streets of Serenia?

Hint:
After you visit one of the shops in the town of Serenia, you can
find  a silver  coin in  the  street.  It will  be located  just
outside the tailor's door at the  entrance to an alley. There is
also  a barrel  in the  alley entrance.  Be sure  to look in the
barrel and tAke the fish.

Problem:
What do I do at the Tailor's Shop?

Hint:
You can  get a blue  cloak from the  tailor. But first  you will
need  to get  the golden   needle from  the haystack  beside the
Swarthy Hog's Inn. Give the tailor the golden needle and he will
give you the cloak.

Problem:
What do I do at the Shoe Shop?

Hint:
The shoe maker is very poor and would like to retire. If only he
had  enough money.  Perhaps if  he had  a rare  pair of shoes to
sell. You can  get him such a pair  of shoes from an elf  in the
witch's forest.

Problem:
What do I do at the Toy Shop?

Hint:
The  toy maker  will gladly  accept the  marionette you got from
grandpa gnome and his grandson.  He will exchange the marionette
for a sled.

Problem:
How do I avoid dying of thirst?

Hint:
Drink from a desert oasis. There are many of them to drink from.
In fact,  in the extreme desert  heat, an oasis provides  a good
place to save your game.

Problem:
What should I do with the skeleton I found?

Hint:
You will notice a shoe near the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the skeleton?

Hint:
The skeleton is in the desert. Start  at the Bee tree, go west 4
screens. The next screen west is an oasis, enter this screen and
drink. Go west  2 more screens, then south  1 screen. You should
now see the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the Temple?

Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is an  oasis. Enter this  screen and drink.  Go north 2  screens
from  the oasis,  until you  are next  to the  cliff. Go  west 3
screens along the cliff, you should  see an opening in the cliff
and a  small pool of  water near the  rocks. Make sure  to drink
from the pool.  Go north 1 screen at the  opening. You should be
at the temple.

Problem:
How can I find the Bandit's camp?

Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is  an  oasis.  Enter  this  screen  and  drink.  Go west 2 more
screens,  then south  3 screens.  You should  now be  at another
oasis. Drink.  Go south 1  more screen, then  go west until  you
reach the tents (4 screens). You are now at the camp. Be sure to
drink from the large jug in the middle of the camp.

Problem:
How  do I  avoid being  killed  by  the bandits  in front  of the
temple?

Hint:
Hide from them behind the rocks on the east side of the entrance
to the temple.  Spy on the bandits and  pay special attention to
the staff that one of them is carrying.

Problem:
I'm at  the bandits' hideout  and there are  many drunken bandits
around. What should I do?

Hint:
At the  bandits' hideout, enter  the first tent.  The bandit has
fallen asleep at his post! Be  careful not to wake him. Sneak to
the back of the tent and  get the staff leaning against the back
of the tent. Then leave the tent quietly. You can use this staff
to get into the temple.

Problem:
I'm at the  bandits' hideout and the place looks abandoned.  What
should I do?

Hint:
If there is no one at  the bandits' hideout, you'll need to come
back later.  Go to the  entrance of the  desert temple and  hide
behind some rocks on the east side at the base of the cliff. Spy
on the bandits  and pay special attention to  the staff that one
of them is carrying.

Problem:
What do I do with the staff?

Hint:
Do you recall seeing the bandits open the desert temple with the
staff? Now it's  your turn. Go to the desert  temple and use the
staff to open the temple. When  you get inside, quickly take the
gold coin  and brass bottle  from the floor  and get out  of the
temple.

Problem:
How do I avoid being sealed up in the desert temple?

Hint:
Save your game  just before entering the temple.  When you enter
the temple to get the brass bottle and gold coin, do it quickly.
There is just  enough time to get these two  items only and then
head out of  the opening. Don't spend any extra  time in here or
you'll be sealed up forever!

Problem:
How do I get rid of the witch?

Hint:
Remember  the brass  bottle you  got out  of the  desert temple?
Well, it's time  to use it. Give the brass  bottle to the witch.
She's so  greedy that she'll snatch  up the bottle and  open it.
Stand back and watch her own greed be her demise.

Problem:
What should I get from the witch's house?

Hint:
You'll need  to take the  pouch from her  chest of drawers,  the
spinning wheel from her trunk, and a key from her lantern.

Problem:
That witch keeps turning me into a frog.  How do I protect myself
from her evil magic powers?

Hint:
You'll need  to see the  gypsy, Madam Mushka.  Give Madam Mushka
the gold coin you got from  the desert temple. She will give you
a  magic amulet  that will   protect you  from the  witch's evil
spells.

Problem:
I've seen a tree with a locked door on it near the witch's house.
How do I open it?

Hint:
Use the key that you got  from the witch's lantern to unlock the
door of the tree.

Problem:
What should I find inside the tree?

Hint:
You  should find  a golden  heart. Take  it and  give it  to the
talking willow tree you saw outside the witch's forest.

Problem:
I've gotten rid of the witch, but now I seem to be trapped in the
witch's forest. How do I get out of here?

Hint:
To get  out of the witch's  forest, go one screen  west from her
house. Select the honeycomb from your inventory, and squeeze the
honey out of  it onto the trail. Then  throw three emeralds onto
the trail.  An elf will appear  and lead you out  of the witch's
forest.

Problem:
What  do I  do with  the spinning  wheel I  got from  the witch's
house?

Hint:
Remember the grandpa  gnome you saw in the  main forest? You now
have  something  that  will  interest  him.  This  is  a special
spinning wheel, which he'll gladly  trade you for his grandson's
marionette.

Problem:
Every time I  go into the Swarthy Hog's  Inn, a hardened criminal
knocks me unconscious, throws me  into the basement, and the game
ends. What am I supposed to do here?

Hint:
Unfortunately, you  will have to  be knocked unconscious  by the
disreputable thug  and thrown in  the basement. However,  if you
made friends with the rat  outside the Baker Brothers' Bake Shop
(by throwing  an old shoe at  the mangy cat chasing  him), he'll
free you by gnawing the rope that they've tied you up with. Once
free, take the  rope and use the hammer the  shoe maker gave you
to break the  lock on the door. Go into  the kitchen and get the
leg of  lamb, then exit the  Swarthy Hog's Inn through  the back
door of the kitchen.

Problem:
Where do I get a gold coin to give to the gypsy, Madam Mushka?

Hint:
You can get  a gold coin from the temple  in the desert. It will
be on the floor beside a brass bottle.

Problem:
Cedric warns  me to stay away  from some bees in  the hollow of a
tree. Should I stay away from those bees?

Hint:
Heed Cedric's advice. After all, you don't want a swarm of angry
bees after  you! However, if  you see a  bear attacking the  bee
tree, offer  your assistance. Remember  the fish you  got out of
the barrel in town? Throw the  fish to the bear. He'll leave the
bees alone and the queen bee will reward you for your kindness.

Problem:
How do I get the dog to stop digging up the ant castle?

Hint:
Be sure to pick up the stick  at the base of the bee tree. Throw
the stick at the dog and  he'll forget all about the ant castle.
And for your kindness, the king of the ants will vow to help you
with your journey later.

Problem:
How can  I get the marionette  from the little gnome  boy and his
grandfather?

Hint:
Do you remember the spinning wheel you got from the witch? Well,
that was  no ordinary spinning wheel!  Offer this spinning wheel
to grandpa gnome and he'll trade you the marionette for it.

Problem:
How can I help both Prince Herbert and the talking tree?

Hint:
You  will find  out that   the talking  tree is  actually Prince
Herbert's  fiance. You  can help  her by  returning her heart to
her. You'll find her heart locked  inside a tree just one screen
east of the witch's house. Once you have the heart, return it to
the  talking  tree.  She'll  turn  into  the  beautiful princess
Alicia. Since  she'll no longer  have a use  for the harp  she's
been playing, she'll  toss it to the ground. Be  sure to pick up
the harp.

Problem:
Where  do  I  get  the  silver  coin  to  buy  a pie at the Baker
Brothers' Bake Shop?

Hint:
You can  find a silver coin  in the streets of  the city. You'll
find it at an alley entrance near the tailor's shop.

Problem:
I've seen a large rat being chased by a mangy cat in front of the
Baker Brothers' Bake Shop. Should I try to help the rat?

Hint:
Yes, throw  the old shoe (you  found beside the skeleton  in the
desert) at the cat. The rat will be so grateful, that he'll help
you later in your journey.

Problem:
How  do  I  get  the  poisonous  snake  away  from the path it is
guarding?

Hint:
When Madam  Mushka's gypsy caravan  pulled away, they  dropped a
tambourine at  their old campsite.  Shake the tambourine  at the
snake and you'll scare him away.

Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part  of the path I'm traveling on.  How do I get off
this ledge without dying?

Hint:
Use the  rope you kept (from  the basement of the  Swarthy Hog's
Inn) and  throw it over the  rock on the edge  of the cliff. You
can then climb up the cliff.

Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part of the path I'm traveling on. I've tried tying a
rope on the branch above me, but when I climb the rope the branch
breaks. How can I climb the rope without breaking the branch?

Hint:
Don't throw the rope around  the branch. Instead, throw the rope
around the  rock that's sticking  out of the  edge of the  cliff
just above.

Problem:
I'm on the upper trail of  the mountain now and the waterfall has
washed away parts of this trail as  well. How do I join Cedric on
the other side?

Hint:
Carefully walk to the edge of  the cliff and jump onto the small
boulders of  ice protruding from  the frozen waterfall.  You can
hop on  these boulders to  get to the  other side. Once  you get
over there, walk on the log. You've now joined Cedric.

Problem:
Help! Cedric's  been captured by a  wolf! Every time I  run after
him, I slip and fall off the mountain. How can I rescue him?

Hint:
Did you  get the sled  from the  toy  maker in town?  You had to
trade him grandpa gnome's marionette for the sled. Use that sled
here to get down the mountain slope.

Problem:
I've seen  a poor, hungry eagle  outside Queen Icebella's Palace.
What could I give him?

Hint:
Yes. Feed  him the leg  of lamb (that  you got from  the kitchen
cupboard of the Swarthy Hog's Inn). However, be sure Graham eats
some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Graham is becoming hungry. What can I feed him?

Hint:
Feed Graham some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Queen Icebella keeps commanding her wolves to kill me.  How can I
avoid this?

Hint:
Remember  the harp  Princess Alicia  dropped?  Well, play it for
Queen Icebella and she'll call off her wolves.

Problem:
How do you kill a Yeti anyway?

Hint:
You  can kill  the Yeti  by throwing  the pie  (you got from the
Baker Brothers'  Bake Shop) into  the Yeti's face.  After you've
killed the Yeti, go into Crystal Cave and get a glowing Crystal.

Problem:
I'm  on a  very confusing  and  windy  path above  a swift  river
coursing its way through a ravine. How do I get out of here?

Hint:
You  will notice  a pool  high up  on the  cliff where Cedric is
sitting. Move  to the opening in  the center of the  cliff below
and Graham will climb the mountain to join Cedric. As soon as he
gets up there,  he'll be captured by Roc and  taken away to this
two-headed bird's nest.

Problem:
I've seen a rusty crowbar on the beach. Should I take it?

Hint:
Yes. You never know when a rusty crowbar will come in handy.

Problem:
I'm at a hermit's house on the  beach. I'm trying to talk to him,
but he's hard of hearing. How can I get him to hear me?

Hint:
To get  the old hermit to  hear what you have  to say, travel to
island of  Harpies and be sure  to pick up a  conch shell on the
beach. You can give the conch shell to him, which he'll use as a
hearing aid.

Problem:
There's a hole in the boat on the beach. How can I repair it?

Hint:
Use the beeswax to repair the hole in the boat. Your boat is now
ready for travel.

Problem:
The  boat,  Cedric,  and  I  keep  getting  eaten  by a giant sea
creature. How can we avoid being eaten?

Hint:
When  you're  traveling  in  the  ocean,  it's  best to map your
journey to the island Harpies. The best way to avoid being eaten
by the sea creature is to travel  a direct route to and from the
island of Harpies. When traveling from the beach where you found
the boat, go  west, west, west, then south.  When returning from
the island of Harpies to the hermit, go west, then south, south,
and south.

Problem:
How do I keep the Harpies from eating me?

Hint:
You can easily  distract the Harpies from killing  you by giving
them an  object you have. Remember  the harp you picked  up from
Princess Alicia?  Well, give it  to one of  the Harpies. They'll
fight over it and that'll give you a chance to escape.

Problem:
Cedric's been hurt on the island of Harpies. Where can I take him
to be healed?

Hint:
You'll want  to take Cedric  back to the  Hermit who is  hard of
hearing.  Also, be  sure to  pick up  the conch  shell from  the
beach. You can give the shell to the Hermit, so he can hear you.
He'll heal Cedric by using special poultice herbs.

Problem:
I've seen  a shell on  the beach at  the island of  Harpies. Do I
need it?

Hint:
Yes. You can give the shell to  the Hermit, which he'll use as a
hearing aid. He has many things  to tell you and will assist you
in your journey.

Problem:
I've landed on Mordack's Island. When  I walk up the path leading
to his  castle, two cobra dragon statues kill me.  How  can I get
past them without being fried?

Hint:
Do you remember killing the Yeti for Queen Icebella? Well, after
you killed him, did you get a glowing crystal from Crystal Cave?
Use  the crystal  now to  protect yourself  from these  dragons'
deadly breath!

Problem:
How do I get into Mordack's Castle?

Hint:
Don't go into the castle through the main door. Instead, walk up
the path  on the east  side of the  castle. You will  come to an
opening in the ground covered by a grate. Use the crowbar to pry
open the  grate. You do have  a crowbar, don't you?  If not, you
can find the crowbar one screen west of the hermit's house.

Problem:
I'm lost in a maze inside Mordack's Castle. What am I supposed to
do in here and how do I get out?

Hint:
You will find  two things in Mordack's maze; a  Dink and a door.
When you find the Dink, give him the tambourine you got from the
gypsy  campsite and  he will   dance a  crazy dance.  While he's
dancing, one of Dink's hairpins will fall to the ground. Use the
Dink's hairpin to open the locked door.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's supply room. What am I supposed to get here?

Hint:
Get the bag of peas out of the cupboard on the east wall.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's kitchen and  there's a woman cleaning the floor.
What does she want?

Hint:
Yes. Approach Cassima and give her  the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. In return for your kindness, she will help you later
on.

Problem:
Every  time  I  enter  the  hallway  beside  the  kitchen, one of
Mordack's henchmen captures  me and throws me into  a prison cell
in the basement. How do I get past this henchman?

Hint:
When you see  the henchman coming at you, throw  the bag of peas
at him. He  will slip on the peas  and fall unconscious. Quickly
walk past him into the dining hall.

Problem:
I've been thrown into a prison cell in Mordack's basement. How do
I escape?

Hint:
Do you remember seeing the  woman, Cassima, cleaning the kitchen
floor? Well, you needed to give her the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. Had  you given her the locket,  she'd have freed you
from the prison cell. Also, be sure to look in the rat's hole in
the  prison cell  and get  the moldy  cheese with  the fish hook
(that  you found  on the  island of  Harpies). That moldy cheese
will come in very handy.

Problem:
I'm  trying to  go up  the stairway  beside the  dining room, but
another one of  Mordack's henchmen captures me and  returns me to
the prison cell in the basement. How do I get past this one?

Hint:
This henchman  is a little easier  to get around than  the first
one. Go into the dining room and walk to the northeast corner of
the dining table.  The henchman will try to  block your way. But
he's big and moves very slowly. Quickly walk around to the other
side of the table and walk right past him!

Problem:
I'm sneaking around  Mordack's bedroom and a very  mean cat keeps
alerting Mordack that I'm there. How do I keep this cat quiet?

Hint:
Remember  when you  landed on  Mordack's island  and wrecked the
boat? Well, right  on the beach was a dead  catfish. Did you get
the fish? If  so, throw it at the cat  and while he's eating the
fish carefully  approach him and  trap him in  the empty bag  of
peas. But do be careful, for he's a vicious cat!

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's study. What's worth reading?

Hint:
Go over to  his desk and take a  look at the old tome.  When you
thumb  through the  pages you'll  acquire the  tiger spell,  the
mongoose spell, the rabbit spell, and the rain cloud spell. Wait
in the study until you see  Mordack return to his bedroom and go
to sleep. Next,  go into his bedroom and take  the wand from his
nightstand.

Problem:
Every time I go into Mordack's laboratory,  he  sees me and kills
me. How do I avoid him killing me?

Hint:
Don't go in the laboratory  when Mordack is there. First, you'll
want to go to Mordack's bedroom  and then to his study. Read the
old tome in his study and wait there. After awhile, Mordack will
return to his bedroom and go  to sleep. Go back into his bedroom
and get the wand from his nightstand. Now you can safely go into
his laboratory.

Problem:
I've got Mordack's wand. Now what?

Hint:
Go up the spiral staircase  and put both Crispin's and Mordack's
wands into  the machine upstairs.  Next, put the  piece of moldy
cheese  (you got  from the  rat's  hole  in the  prison cell  of
Mordack's basement) into the machine.  This will drain the power
from  Mordack's wand  and at  the same  time charge up Crispin's
wand. Finally, remove Crispin's wand from the machine.

Problem:
I've gone up a spiral  staircase in Mordack's laboratory and have
found a machine. How do I use it?

Hint:
Put both  Crispin's and Mordack's  wand into the  machine. Next,
put the  piece of moldy cheese  (you got from the  rat's hole in
the prison  cell of Mordack's  basement) into the  machine. This
will drain  the power from Mordack's  wand and at the  same time
charge up  Crispin's wand. Finally,  remove Crispin's wand  from
the machine.

Problem:
I've successfully  drained Mordack's magical  wand, but now  he's
turned into a giant dragonfly. How do I defeat him?

Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's  study.  Then  when  Mordack  comes  after  you  as  a
dragonfly, select Crispin's wand  from your inventory. Point the
wand at Mordack  and you'll be able to  select from four spells.
To defeat the dragonfly, select the tiger spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a dragon. How do I defeat him?

Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack  comes after you as a dragon,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll  be able to select from  four spells. To foil
Mordack's  plans to  destroy you  this time,  select the  rabbit
spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a cobra. How do I defeat him?

Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then  when Mordack comes after you  as a cobra,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To defeat
the cobra, select the mongoose spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned  himself into a ring of fire.  How do I defeat
him?

Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes  after you as a ring of
fire, select Crispin's wand from  your inventory. Point the wand
at Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. Select
the  rain cloud  spell and  you'll rid  your kingdom of Mordack.
Congratulations! You've won King's Quest V.

Problem:
What do I do in the streets of Serenia?
Hint:
After you visit one of the shops in the town of Serenia, you can
find  a silver  coin in  the  street.  It will  be located  just
outside the tailor's door at the  entrance to an alley. There is
also  a barrel  in the  alley entrance.  Be sure  to look in the
barrel and take the fish.
 
Problem:
What do I do at the Tailor's Shop?
Hint:
You can  get a blue  cloak from the  tailor. But first  you will
need  to get  the golden   needle from  the haystack  beside the
Swarthy Hog's Inn. Give the tailor the golden needle and he will
give you the cloak.

Problem:
What do I do at the Shoe Shop?
Hint:
The shoe maker is very poor and would like to retire. If only he
had  enough money.  Perhaps if  he had  a rare  pair of shoes to
sell. You can  get him such a pair  of shoes from an elf  in the
witch's forest.

Problem:
What do I do at the Toy Shop?
Hint:
The  toy maker  will gladly  accept the  marionette you got from
grandpa gnome and his grandson.  He will exchange the marionette
for a sled.

Problem:
How do I avoid dying of thirst?
Hint:
Drink from a desert oasis. There are many of them to drink from.
In fact,  in the extreme desert  heat, an oasis provides  a good
place to save your game.

Problem:
What should I do with the skeleton I found?
Hint:
You will notice a shoe near the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the skeleton?
Hint:
The skeleton is in the desert. Start  at the Bee tree, go west 4
screens. The next screen west is an oasis, enter this screen and
drink. Go west  2 more screens, then south  1 screen. You should
now see the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the Temple?
Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is an  oasis. Enter this  screen and drink.  Go north 2  screens
from  the oasis,  until you  are next  to the  cliff. Go  west 3
screens along the cliff, you should  see an opening in the cliff
and a  small pool of  water near the  rocks. Make sure  to drink
from the pool.  Go north 1 screen at the  opening. You should be
at the temple.

Problem:
How can I find the Bandit's camp?
Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is  an  oasis.  Enter  this  screen  and  drink.  Go west 2 more
screens,  then south  3 screens.  You should  now be  at another
oasis. Drink.  Go south 1  more screen, then  go west until  you
reach the tents (4 screens). You are now at the camp. Be sure to
drink from the large jug in the middle of the camp.

Problem:
How  do I  avoid being  killed  by  the bandits  in front  of the
temple?
Hint:
Hide from them behind the rocks on the east side of the entrance
to the temple.  Spy on the bandits and  pay special attention to
the staff that one of them is carrying.

Problem:
I'm at  the bandits' hideout  and there are  many drunken bandits
around. What should I do?
Hint:
At the  bandits' hideout, enter  the first tent.  The bandit has
fallen asleep at his post! Be  careful not to wake him. Sneak to
the back of the tent and  get the staff leaning against the back
of the tent. Then leave the tent quietly. You can use this staff
to get into the temple.

Problem:
I'm at the  bandits' hideout and the place looks abandoned.  What
should I do?
Hint:
If there is no one at  the bandits' hideout, you'll need to come
back later.  Go to the  entrance of the  desert temple and  hide
behind some rocks on the east side at the base of the cliff. Spy
on the bandits  and pay special attention to  the staff that one
of them is carrying.

Problem:
What do I do with the staff?
Hint:
Do you recall seeing the bandits open the desert temple with the
staff? Now it's  your turn. Go to the desert  temple and use the
staff to open the temple. When  you get inside, quickly take the
gold coin  and brass bottle  from the floor  and get out  of the
temple.

Problem:
How do I avoid being sealed up in the desert temple?
Hint:
Save your game  just before entering the temple.  When you enter
the temple to get the brass bottle and gold coin, do it quickly.
There is just  enough time to get these two  items only and then
head out of  the opening. Don't spend any extra  time in here or
you'll be sealed up forever!

Problem:
How do I get rid of the witch?
Hint:
Remember  the brass  bottle you  got out  of the  desert temple?
Well, it's time  to use it. Give the brass  bottle to the witch.
She's so  greedy that she'll snatch  up the bottle and  open it.
Stand back and watch her own greed be her demise.

Problem:
What should I get from the witch's house?
Hint:
You'll need  to take the  pouch from her  chest of drawers,  the
spinning wheel from her trunk, and a key from her lantern.

Problem:
That witch keeps turning me into a frog.  How do I protect myself
from her evil magic powers?
Hint:
You'll need  to see the  Gypsy, Madam Mushka.  Give Madam Mushka
the gold coin you got from  the desert temple. She will give you
a  magic amulet  that will   protect you  from the  witch's evil
spells.

Problem:
I've seen a tree with a locked door on it near the witch's house.
How do I open it?
Hint:
Use the key that you got  from the witch's lantern to unlock the
door of the tree.

Problem:
What should I find inside the tree?
Hint:
You  should find  a golden  heart. Take  it and  give it  to the
talking willow tree you saw outside the witch's forest.

Problem:
I've gotten rid of the witch, but now I seem to be trapped in the
witch's forest. How do I get out of here?
Hint:
To get  out of the witch's  forest, go one screen  west from her
house. Select the honeycomb from your inventory, and squeeze the
honey out of  it onto the trail. Then  throw three emeralds onto
the trail.  An elf will appear  and lead you out  of the witch's
forest.

Problem:
What  do I  do with  the spinning  wheel I  got from  the witch's
house?
Hint:
Remember the grandpa  gnome you saw in the  main forest? You now
have  something  that  will  interest  him.  This  is  a special
spinning wheel, which he'll gladly  trade you for his grandson's
marionette.
           
                        The Main Forest
Problem:
Every time I  go into the Swarthy Hog's  Inn, a hardened criminal
knocks me unconscious, throws me  into the basement, and the game
ends. What am I supposed to do here?
Hint:
Unfortunately, you  will have to  be knocked unconscious  by the
disreputable thug  and thrown in  the basement. However,  if you
made friends with the rat  outside the Baker Brothers' Bake Shop
(by throwing  an old shoe at  the mangy cat chasing  him), he'll
free you by gnawing the rope that they've tied you up with. Once
free, take the  rope and use the hammer the  shoe maker gave you
to break the  lock on the door. Go into  the kitchen and get the
leg of  lamb, then exit the  Swarthy Hog's Inn through  the back
door of the kitchen.

Problem:
Where do I get a gold coin to give to the Gypsy, Madam Mushka?
Hint:
You can get  a gold coin from the temple  in the desert. It will
be on the floor beside a brass bottle.

Problem:
Cedric warns  me to stay away  from some bees in  the hollow of a
tree. Should I stay away from those bees?
Hint:
Heed Cedric's advice. After all, you don't want a swarm of angry
bees after  you! However, if  you see a  bear attacking the  bee
tree, offer  your assistance. Remember  the fish you  got out of
the barrel in town? Throw the  fish to the bear. He'll leave the
bees alone and the queen bee will reward you for your kindness.

Problem:
How do I get the dog to stop digging up the ant castle?
Hint:
Be sure to pick up the stick  at the base of the bee tree. Throw
the stick at the dog and  he'll forget all about the ant castle.
And for your kindness, the king of the ants will vow to help you
with your journey later.

Problem:
How can  I get the marionette  from the little gnome  boy and his
grandfather?
Hint:
Do you remember the spinning wheel you got from the witch? Well,
that was  no ordinary spinning wheel!  Offer this spinning wheel
to grandpa gnome and he'll trade you the marionette for it.

Problem:
How can I help both Prince Herbert and the talking tree?
Hint:
You  will find  out that   the talking  tree is  actually Prince
Herbert's  fiance. You  can help  her by  returning her heart to
her. You'll find her heart locked  inside a tree just one screen
east of the witch's house. Once you have the heart, return it to
the  talking  tree.  She'll  turn  into  the  beautiful princess
Alicia. Since  she'll no longer  have a use  for the harp  she's
been playing, she'll  toss it to the ground. Be  sure to pick up
the harp.

Problem:
Where  do  I  get  the  silver  coin  to  buy  a pie at the Baker
Brothers' Bake Shop?
Hint:
You can  find a silver coin  in the streets of  the city. You'll
find it at an alley entrance near the tailor's shop.

Problem:
I've seen a large rat being chased by a mangy cat in front of the
Baker Brothers' Bake Shop. Should I try to help the rat?
Hint:
Yes, throw  the old shoe (you  found beside the skeleton  in the
desert) at the cat. The rat will be so grateful, that he'll help
you later in your journey.

Problem:
How  do  I  get  the  poisonous  snake  away  from the path it is
guarding?
Hint:
When Madam  Mushka's Gypsy caravan  pulled away, they  dropped a
tambourine at  their old campsite.  Shake the tambourine  at the
snake and you'll scare him away.

                          Snowy Mountain
Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part  of the path I'm traveling on.  How do I get off
this ledge without dying?
Hint:
Use the  rope you kept (from  the basement of the  Swarthy Hog's
Inn) and  throw it over the  rock on the edge  of the cliff. You
can then climb up the cliff.

Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part of the path I'm traveling on. I've tried tying a
rope on the branch above me, but when I climb the rope the branch
breaks. How can I climb the rope without breaking the branch?
Hint:
Don't throw the rope around  the branch. Instead, throw the rope
around the  rock that's sticking  out of the  edge of the  cliff
just above.

Problem:
I'm on the upper trail of  the mountain now and the waterfall has
washed away parts of this trail as  well. How do I join Cedric on
the other side?
Hint:
Carefully walk to the edge of  the cliff and jump onto the small
boulders of  ice protruding from  the frozen waterfall.  You can
hop on  these boulders to  get to the  other side. Once  you get
over there, walk on the log. You've now joined Cedric.

Problem:
Help! Cedric's  been captured by a  wolf! Every time I  run after
him, I slip and fall off the mountain. How can I rescue him?
Hint:
Did you  get the sled  from the  toy  maker in town?  You had to
trade him grandpa gnome's marionette for the sled. Use that sled
here to get down the mountain slope.

Problem:
I've seen  a poor, hungry eagle  outside Queen Icebella's Palace.
What could I give him?
Hint:
Yes. Feed  him the leg  of lamb (that  you got from  the kitchen
cupboard of the Swarthy Hog's Inn). However, be sure Graham eats
some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Graham is becoming hungry. What can I feed him?
Hint:
Feed Graham some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Queen Icebella keeps commanding her wolves to kill me.  How can I
avoid this?
Hint:
Remember  the harp  Princess Alicia  dropped?  Well, play it for
Queen Icebella and she'll call off her wolves.

Problem:
How do you kill a Yeti anyway?
Hint:
You  can kill  the Yeti  by throwing  the pie  (you got from the
Baker Brothers'  Bake Shop) into  the Yeti's face.  After you've
killed the Yeti, go into Crystal Cave and get a glowing Crystal.

Problem:
I'm  on a  very confusing  and  windy  path above  a swift  river
coursing its way through a ravine. How do I get out of here?
Hint:
You  will notice  a pool  high up  on the  cliff where Cedric is
sitting. Move  to the opening in  the center of the  cliff below
and Graham will climb the mountain to join Cedric. As soon as he
gets up there,  he'll be captured by Roc and  taken away to this
two-headed bird's nest.

          The Hermit, Ocean Voyage, Island of Harpies
Problem:
I've seen a rusty crowbar on the beach. Should I take it?
Hint:
Yes. You never know when a rusty crowbar will come in handy.

Problem:
I'm at a hermit's house on the  beach. I'm trying to talk to him,
but he's hard of hearing. How can I get him to hear me?
Hint:
To get  the old hermit to  hear what you have  to say, travel to
island of  Harpies and be sure  to pick up a  conch shell on the
beach. You can give the conch shell to him, which he'll use as a
hearing aid.

Problem:
There's a hole in the boat on the beach. How can I repair it?
Hint:
Use the beeswax to repair the hole in the boat. Your boat is now
ready for travel.

Problem:
The  boat,  Cedric,  and  I  keep  getting  eaten  by a giant sea
creature. How can we avoid being eaten?
Hint:
When  you're  traveling  in  the  ocean,  it's  best to map your
journey to the island Harpies. The best way to avoid being eaten
by the sea creature is to travel  a direct route to and from the
island of Harpies. When traveling from the beach where you found
the boat, go  west, west, west, then south.  When returning from
the island of Harpies to the hermit, go west, then south, south,
and south.

Problem:
How do I keep the Harpies from eating me?
Hint:
You can easily  distract the Harpies from killing  you by giving
them an  object you have. Remember  the harp you picked  up from
Princess Alicia?  Well, give it  to one of  the Harpies. They'll
fight over it and that will give you a chance to escape.

Problem:
Cedric's been hurt on the island of Harpies. Where can I take him
to be healed?
Hint:
You'll want  to take Cedric  back to the  Hermit who is  hard of
hearing.  Also, be  sure to  pick up  the conch  shell from  the
beach. You can give the shell to the Hermit, so he can hear you.
He'll heal Cedric by using special poultice herbs.

Problem:
I've seen  a shell on  the beach at  the island of  Harpies. Do I
need it?
Hint:
Yes. You can give the shell to  the Hermit, which he'll use as a
hearing aid. He has many things  to tell you and will assist you
in your journey.
 
                       Mordack's Island
Problem:
I've landed on Mordack's Island. When  I walk up the path leading
to his  castle, two cobra dragon statues kill me.  How  can I get
past them without being fried?
Hint:
Do you remember killing the Yeti for Queen Icebella? Well, after
you killed him, did you get a glowing crystal from Crystal Cave?
Use  the crystal  now to  protect yourself  from these  dragons'
deadly breath!

Problem:
How do I get into Mordack's Castle?
Hint:
Don't go into the castle through the main door. Instead, walk up
the path  on the east  side of the  castle. You will  come to an
opening in the ground covered by a grate. Use the crowbar to pry
open the  grate. You do have  a crowbar, don't you?  If not, you
can find the crowbar one screen west of the hermit's house.

Problem:
I'm lost in a maze inside Mordack's Castle. What am I supposed to
do in here and how do I get out?
Hint:
You will find  two things in Mordack's maze; a  Dink and a door.
When you find the Dink, give him the tambourine you got from the
Gypsy  campsite and  he will   dance a  crazy dance.  While he's
dancing, one of Dink's hairpins will fall to the ground. Use the
Dink's hairpin to open the locked door.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's supply room. What am I supposed to get here?
Hint:
Get the bag of peas out of the cupboard on the east wall.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's kitchen and  there's a woman cleaning the floor.
What does she want?
Hint:
Yes. Approach Cassima and give her  the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. In return for your kindness, she will help you later
on.

Problem:
Every  time  I  enter  the  hallway  beside  the  kitchen, one of
Mordack's henchmen captures  me and throws me into  a prison cell
in the basement. How do I get past this henchman?
Hint:
When you see  the henchman coming at you, throw  the bag of peas
at him. He  will slip on the peas  and fall unconscious. Quickly
walk past him into the dining hall.

Problem:
I've been thrown into a prison cell in Mordack's basement. How do
I escape?
Hint:
Do you remember seeing the  woman, Cassima, cleaning the kitchen
floor? Well, you needed to give her the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. Had  you given her the locket,  she'd have freed you
from the prison cell. Also, be sure to look in the rat's hole in
the  prison cell  and get  the moldy  cheese with  the fish hook
(that  you found  on the  island of  Harpies). That moldy cheese
will come in very handy.

Problem:
I'm  trying to  go up  the stairway  beside the  dining room, but
another one of  Mordack's henchmen captures me and  returns me to
the prison cell in the basement. How do I get past this one?
Hint:
This henchman  is a little easier  to get around than  the first
one. Go into the dining room and walk to the northeast corner of
the dining table.  The henchman will try to  block your way. But
he's big and moves very slowly. Quickly walk around to the other
side of the table and walk right past him!

Problem:
I'm sneaking around  Mordack's bedroom and a very  mean cat keeps
alerting Mordack that I'm there. How do I keep this cat quiet?
Hint:
Remember  when you  landed on  Mordack's island  and wrecked the
boat? Well, right  on the beach was a dead  catfish. Did you get
the fish? If  so, throw it at the cat  and while he's eating the
fish carefully  approach him and  trap him in  the empty bag  of
peas. But do be careful, for he's a vicious cat!
 
                  Defeating Mordack

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's study. What's worth reading?
Hint:
Go over to  his desk and take a  look at the old tome.  When you
thumb  through the  pages you'll  acquire the  tiger spell,  the
mongoose spell, the rabbit spell, and the rain cloud spell. Wait
in the study until you see  Mordack return to his bedroom and go
to sleep. Next,  go into his bedroom and take  the wand from his
nightstand.

Problem:
Every time I go into Mordack's laboratory,  he  sees me and kills
me. How do I avoid him killing me?
Hint:
Don't go in the laboratory  when Mordack is there. First, you'll
want to go to Mordack's bedroom  and then to his study. Read the
old tome in his study and wait there. After awhile, Mordack will
return to his bedroom and go  to sleep. Go back into his bedroom
and get the wand from his nightstand. Now you can safely go into
his laboratory.

Problem:
I've got Mordack's wand. Now what?
Hint:
Go up the spiral staircase  and put both Crispin's and Mordack's
wands into  the machine upstairs.  Next, put the  piece of moldy
cheese  (you got  from the  rat's  hole  in the  prison cell  of
Mordack's basement) into the machine.  This will drain the power
from  Mordack's wand  and at  the same  time charge up Crispin's
wand. Finally, remove Crispin's wand from the machine.

Problem:
I've gone up a spiral  staircase in Mordack's laboratory and have
found a machine. How do I use it?
Hint:
Put both  Crispin's and Mordack's  wand into the  machine. Next,
put the  piece of moldy cheese  (you got from the  rat's hole in
the prison  cell of Mordack's  basement) into the  machine. This
will drain  the power from Mordack's  wand and at the  same time
charge up  Crispin's wand. Finally,  remove Crispin's wand  from
the machine.

Problem:
I've successfully  drained Mordack's magical  wand, but now  he's
turned into a giant dragonfly. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's  study.  Then  when  Mordack  comes  after  you  as  a
dragonfly, select Crispin's wand  from your inventory. Point the
wand at Mordack  and you'll be able to  select from four spells.
To defeat the dragonfly, select the tiger spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a dragon. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack  comes after you as a dragon,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll  be able to select from  four spells. To foil
Mordack's  plans to  destroy you  this time,  select the  rabbit
spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a cobra. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then  when Mordack comes after you  as a cobra,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To defeat
the cobra, select the mongoose spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned  himself into a ring of fire.  How do I defeat
him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes  after you as a ring of
fire, select Crispin's wand from  your inventory. Point the wand
at Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. Select
the  rain cloud  spell and  you'll rid  your kingdom of Mordack.
Congratulations! You've won King's Quest V.

                           Dr. Strange

     First we would just like to say that this was one of the
easiest Sierra game we have ever played. Second, we would also
like to say that this is also one of the best Sierra games we
have played.. (Wonder why..-=]) At any rate.. On with the Solve!

1. MAP 
------
You'll need a Map of the Land around you so you can figure out
what area I'm talking about.. Look for the ANSi Map..

2. What to do first..
---------------------
Get to know the commands and what they do.. you'll need to know a
lot of things later when it is more dependant on the movements..

3. What to do from the start..
------------------------------

1. Get the stick laying in front of the dead tree with the BEES
swarming around it..

2. Go to the ANT hill.. There should be a dog there.. throw the
stick at the dog..

3. Go to the INN and put the hand on the hay stack outside.

4. Goto the TOWN and look in the barrel near the broken wagon.
Get the Fish inside the barrel.

5. Talk to the man working on the wagon.

7. Go into the Tailor store.. (First store that you can go to)
and give the man inside the golden needle. (You'll get the coat)

8. Now when you're outside pick up the silver coin that is laying
near the wagon.

9. Go to the BAKERY and get the pie. (Don't Eat it Yet!)

10. Go to the screen with the GYPSIES. and start heading out into
the dessert.. (*NOTE* you have to start at the gypsies or you
could die).

11. Directions for the first Oasis from the Gypsies..
LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-LEFT (Drink the Water!!)

12. Hide behind the Big rock on the left of the Oasis and wait
for the horsemen to come and go.. Watch them closely..

13. Now to get the boot..
DOWN-DOWN-RIGHT-DOWN Pick it up!
Now to the Oasis go..
DOWN-DOWN

14. Drink the Water at the Oasis!

15. Then to get to the CARAVAN go..
LEFT-DOWN-LEFT-LEFT-LEFT

16. At the CARAVAN go into the Empty tent on the right...  when
you enter the tent grab (with the hand) the Rod in the back..
Then walk to the right side of the tent THEN out.. if you walk
straight out you'll hit the sleeping man's feet and he'll kill
you..

17. Once outside the Tent goto the Vase right near the fire and
drink the water!

18. Then head back to the Second Oasis. Reverse.. For those of
you who are dumb enough not to know how.. it's RIGHT-UP-RIGHT-
RIGHT-RIGHT..

19. Then Drink the Water there and Go back up to the first Oasis.
UP-UP-LEFT-UP-UP-UP

20. Then drink some water and goto the Temple and use the Rod you
got from the Caravan on the big door.. (You have to go extremely
fast.. so save your game here!)

21. Once inside. Make great haste in grabbing the lamp and the
golden coin on the inside right near the door.. The Door WILL
close on you so work fast and don't get trapped forever! (DO NOT
RUB THE LAMP!!!!)

22. After you get outside the Temple go to the First Oasis and
drink the water.. then go right until you reach the GYPSIES.

23. Then give the man outside the Gypsies the golden coin you got
from the temple.  You will be given an amulet from the Gypsy that
will protect you from the magic of the Witch..

24. Then Go into the Witch's Forest and when you first encounter
her. Talk with her and then give her the Lamp..  She will vanish
and then you can go to the WITCH'S HOUSE.  Inside open the little
incense burner and grab the key.  Then open the trunk and get the
Yarn spinner.. Then open the small drawer and get the bag of
emeralds.  Look closely for these things.. They are hard to find
with VGA screens.

25. Once out of the Witch's House go Right and open the hole in
the Tree and retrieve the golden heart.

26.  Then go LEFT twice from the tree with the hole.  Here you
will find your way out here.  First go as far left as possible
and get as close to the middle of the left-hand side as you can..
Then use the honey comb you got from the BEES and you should have
squeezed it so there is a pile of Honey on the ground. Then (If
you haven't already done so) Open the pouch and find the emeralds
inside.  Then toss the emeralds down at the honey. A little man
will come out and gab the emeralds.. after the third time of this
you should throw it into the honey and the little man should get
stuck in it.  You should grab him (If the computer doesn't) and
he'll show you the way out.. follow him! He'll give you a pair of
shoes.

27.  Now go left to the Weeping Willow tree and give her the
Golden heart. She will drop her harp. Pick it up! Now go down and
give the old gnome the yarn spinning machine. Get the Marionette!

28. Go to Town and enter the Toy store and give the Man the
marionette! He should give you the sled.

29. Go to the Shoe shop and give them the shoes. They should give
you their hammer.

30. Then go to the outside of the Bakery and when the cat comes
chasing the mouse throw the old shoe you picked up in the desert
at the cat.  You'll be big buddies with the Mouse.

31. Now you should go into the INN.. you'll be knocked out but
don't worry.  The mouse will untie you.. Get the Rope, Use the
Hammer on the door, Open the Door, Go out of the Cellar and
you'll be in the kitchen.  Open the Cupboard get the lamb-leg,
and go out the door on the left!

32. Go back to where the GYPSIES were and pick up the Tambourine. 
Go to the screen with the snake and rattle the tambourine at it.

33. At the Icy Mountains, Put on the coat and go to the next
screen.

34. At the next screen eat part of the lamb leg and use the rope
and throw it up to lasso on the rock. (NOT THE TREE!).

35. Once you're up there put the hand on the first stepping stone
to the left top of the group.  Then jump to the next TOP stepping
stone.  Do the Same with the last one until there is only one to
jump to. Then walk close to the right side of the old log and
just use the travel command. (Just walk across)

36.  On the next screen a wolf will grab the Owl you've been
traveling with. Use the sled on the ground and take off after
them!

37.  On the outside of the Cave there will be an Eagle. Give the
eagle your Lamb leg. He will save you later.  Then walk toward
the cave.

38. When inside the cave. At the First chance, Play the harp and
she will let you go kill the Yeti. 

39. When you are at the Yeti's cave and he is rushing at you,

and in the center of the room will be a crystal. Use the hammer
on the crystal. Get the crystal (if it doesn't get it for you)
and head back to the wolf.

40. Once the Wolf lets you go after you've been back to the cave
go down and you'll be a the cliff.

41. at the cliff follow the path around to the top of the screen
and then once you are at the right side, move over.  Then when
you are at middle of the path try to climb the cliff by walking
near the side of the cliff you can see.

42.  You'll be captured and taken to the nest of the big hungry
bird.  Grab the shiny thing next to you fast and wait for the
eagle you helped out to come.

43. After you're dropped off by the eagle pick up the pipe kind
of thing at the bottom of the screen and go to the screen above
it.  

44.  Put the bee's wax in the boat. You'll seal the patch in it.
Then push on the boat and here's the directions to the Harpies
Island. RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN

45. Here you will be captured and they will eat you unless you
play the harp.  Once you do that they will go fight over it and
you should grab the hook on the ground and go left.  Pick up your
friend the owl and go left again. Now before you get into your
boat and head off get the shell on the beach THEN head off.

46. Once in the Ocean head left until you hit the land.  Then
ring the bell of the Hermit's house and give him the shell.  He
will fix up your friend the owl and show you on your way to the
Castle of the Evil wizard.

47. Here get the fish and start heading up to the top of the
stairs.  Here after you get to the screen with the two dragon
heads on both sides of the path, use the crystal that you got
from the Yeti cave and use it on yourself you can pass through
the two dragon heads without any trouble.

48. Once up to the main gate of the castle go to the left side of
the castle.  Once there on the side, pry the grading open and go
down into the maze.  Once in the maze hunt around for a grey guy
who looks like a rock.  Once you find him give him the tambourine
and he will jump up and down and drop a hair pin.  Grab that and
find the door in the maze and use the hair pin on it.

-NOTE- FROM HERE ON IN IS LUCK.. YOU JUST HAVE TO WORK AT IT A
BIT TO GET BY.. TOOK ME AGES.

49. Once inside the actual castle open the cabinet on the left
and grab the bag of peas.  You will need it when you see The evil
magician's henchmen.  When you do see them (at about any time)
throw the peas at them.  But if you get captured don't worry the
lady will rescue you.. now on to the screen with her.

50. After getting the peas go up and give the lady washing the
floors the locket.  She will help you get out of the dungeon.

51. YOU MUST GET CAUGHT BY THE HENCHMAN ONCE AND USE THE FISH
HOOK ON THE MOUSE HOLE IN THE DUNGEON TO GET THE MOLDY CHEESE!!!
but first.... Don't forget to do # 50!!!

52.  Now from the Kitchen where the lady is go right twice and
then down. Wait for the henchman on the far right side of the
screen.  If you haven't used the peas yet BUT have been captured,
wait for the henchman to come and throw the peas at him. (You'll
need the bag that the peas were in later). When you see the black
cat on any screen throw the fish at him then use the empty pea
bag to capture him.  Now go left and up the stairs.  Then go to
the left and then down till you are in the library and put the
hand on the TOME on the table and you will learn spells to defeat
the evil wizard.  Wait until the Wizard goes to sleep in the
study.  You will see him appear and then fall asleep.  Go up into
his bedroom and grab his wand.  Then go to the right twice and up
the spiral staircase.

53.  Go to the far right side after climbing the stairs.  After
the screen appears.  Put The evil wizard's wand down on the
machine.  Then put Crispin's Wand on the other side.  Then put
the moldy cheese inside the machine and let it switch the power
from the Evil Wizard's Wand into Crispin's.  Then the Evil wizard
will come into the room and you have to use Crispin's wand to
cast Tiger spell when he becomes the dragon fly.  Then cast
Rabbit when he becomes the dragon.  Then cast Mongoose when he
becomes the snake. Then Cast Storm when he is the ring of fire
around you..

54. Sit back and watch the ending.. Enjoy!

                    King's Quest III Hints
                         John Geiser



     So your stuck huh?  Well I tell you there were times
when I was going to throw the game, no, the whole computer
out my window because the game was driving me nuts and I
thought it was impossible to solve!
     But that just makes you feel better when you finally
finish the game.  So please DON'T go through this and read
everything.  Read only when you are REALLY stuck.  If you use
your brain you can get almost all of the puzzles.

IN THE HOUSE:  In here the first thing you should do is do
what the wizard tells you (ie. Sweep the kitchen, feed the
chickens).  Then get everything you can in the house.  But
DON'T get anything from the basement.  In the wizards bedroom
you will find lot's of helpful things.  One word of caution:
the wizard will leave on a trip and he always returns around
30 minutes of playing time, so don't have anything magical in
possession because the wizard will kill you.  The next thing
to do is leave the house and be careful going down the path.

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE:  Once down the path be careful of the two
muggers (if you get mugged it's okay, I'll tell you about
that later).  Next you should get everything you can.
(Another hint: On the disk is a file called OBJECTS, TYPE
this file to see all the Items you need to get in the game.)
If you get mugged you can get everything back in a tree by
the desert.  You must pull a rope beneath the tree in a hole
and a ladder will come down you then climb it and there is a
tree fort on the tree.  You must get the porridge from the
three bears cottage, but DON"T eat it, you will need it
later.  You must also get a thimble from the house and fill
it up with dew drops from the flowers.  To get the snake skin
you must first kill Medusa.  You can do this by going in a
desert screen and have your man facing the right side of the
screen, then when Medusa appears enter "use mirror" (which
you got in the house) and she will fry! (turn into stone)
then walk along the desert, ONLY up or down but never to the
left because this leads nowhere and is useless.  If you
haven't already been in the fort in the tree you will need to
go there to get some coins.  Go to the store and buy one of
everything.  Keep an eye on your time because when the time
gets around 30 minutes the wizard comes back from his trip
and if your out of the house he will kill you.  Get
everything you need (Mistletoe, some mud from ocean, a cup of
ocean water etc) then head back home.

BACK IN THE HOUSE: Okay now you back home with all of that
magic stuff so what do you do?  Go upstairs and put all under
bed.  Then wait for wizard to come back.  When he does he
will want to eat so feed him some food, BESIDES the porridge,
because you will need this later.  The wizard will then go to
sleep.  At this time you will need all the stuff from outside
the house and the wizards wand to make the spells.  Having
trouble finding the wand?  Well all I will tell you is that
the key to the wand is in the wizards bedroom, but DON'T take
it when the wizard is sleeping, he will zap you.  Having
problems finding the fly wings?  They are in the telescope
room.  Go in the basement (to do this move books in wizards
den and then pull lever).  Go downstairs to basement and
watch out for the cat!  If he is by the stairs leading to the
basement you will trip over him and die.  By the way did you
get the cat hair from the cat and the dog hair from the dog
in the store outside the house?  If not you will need it.
     Next make the spells by typing the steps from the
instruction booklet.  Be careful you MUST type the spells
exactly as the book shows them or you will die a horrible
(and very funny) death!  When you are done with the spells.
Put everything under your bed except the porridge and the
cookie that changes people into a cat.  Put the cookie in the
porridge and when the wizard wakes up feed the poison
porridge to the wizard and then....

THE STUPID WIZARD IS DEAD!!!!!! (Well actually just a cat!)

     Have you been wondering how to get in the cave with the
spider?  Now that you have the spell to fly like an eagle, go
to that screen and use it.  You will pick up the spider and
drop it in the ocean.  To get a boat to travel across the sea
go to the bar and give coin to captain. He will let you on
the ship!

NOTES:  This is only part of the adventure if you need more
help on the above hints drop me (that's John Geiser) a note
and I will get back to you!.  I also have solved Space Quest
, King's Quest, King's Quest II and The Black Caldron if you
need any help just ask!

P.S.  The most important thing when playing this adventure is
to save the game frequently!!  This helps dramatically!!!!!
You MUST do this to win (unless you're real good).

                       THE LEGEND OF KYRANDIA SOLVE
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           by  Vision Assembler

                               08 / 09 / 92

      Well, here's another solve by the man himself.  Thanks go to
Neural Plexus for his little help.  Anyway, this game was excellent
and was well worth the time.  The graphics are truly amazing and
the sound track was pretty pleasant also.  What really amazed me
about the game was the intro when they did the focusing from hand to
head and then to the window.  That was pretty cool.  Overall, smooth
animation even on a 286 (very enjoyable).

Now, let's get started:

TREEHOUSE:
~~~~~~~~~~
We start off as Brandon the grandson of... your grandfather.
Pick up the garnet (red jewel) on the table.
Pick up the note from the table.
Pick up the saw from under the table.
Click on the big pot (you get an apple).
Leave this place.


OUTSIDE: (FOREST 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two screens to the right you will find a pond of (salty) water.
Click on the pond and get a teardrop.
Proceed to the right.
A leaf should fall and will turn into a (green) peridot.
Pick up the peridot.
 (On your way around this place, you will find an Amethyst. If you do
  find it, pick it up also.  It's a purple jewel.)
After you pick up the peridot, go up and then left.
Here is the Forest Altar.  Pick up a lavender rose here.
Go to the right.  (The Amethyst usually appears here.)
Let's proceed back.  Go left, left, down, left, left, left, left.
Here lies a half-dead willow tree.  Use the teardrop on the willow.
Merith comes a long at this moment and asks you if you want to play.
Merith has the marble so follow him to the right.
Follow Merith until he has disappeared.
Go to the south.  Go south again and then to the left.
There's Herman.  He tends this bridge, which is now broken.
Talk to Herman.
Give your saw to Herman.
Leave the cave to the right and go north and north again.
Go all the way to the left until you can no longer proceed that way.
Now go up and enter the church building.
Brynn enters the room.  Talk to Brynn.
Give Brynn the note.  She will decipher it for you.
Give Brynn the lavender rose.  You now have a silver rose.
Leave this place and go south.
Go all the way to the right and then up.
Merith should be here.  Just watch.
Pick up the marble when Merith is gone.
Go to your right.
Here is the forest altar.
Use the marble on the altar.
Use the silver rose on the altar.  You now have the amulet.
Now go left and all the way south and then left again.
You're back in the cave, and by this time, Herman should have fixed up the
 bridge.
Now you can cross the bridge safely.


AREA 2:  (FOREST 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once across the bridge, proceed to your left.
Enter the hut.
Talk to Darm the wizard.  He will tell you to find a quill for him.
Leave the hut and go south.
This is a small forest and is a near quadilateral shape so it is not
 hard to find your way around.  During your exploration, you will find
 certain gems and jewels.  It would be convenient to put these in front
 of the golden plate altar once your inventory is full.
Look for three items.  An acorn (on a tree), a walnut and a pinecone.
 Once you have found these items, go to the screen (at the bottom of the
 area) where there is a hole in the ground.
Drop these three nuts into the hole.
 A Pseudobushiahugiflora will appear and will give you the first stone
 to your amulet.  It allows you to have the power of healing.
Now go north a few screens until you see a bird nest with a bird on it.
Click on the yellow stone on your amulet.
Pick up the quill.
Go back to the hut and give the quill to Darm.  In return, he will give
 you a magical scroll.  You can try this scroll out if you wish.
Once you have the scroll, Darm will tell you about the birthstones.  The
 first birthstone you seek is at the fountain in the river.
Go to the river and click at the bottom of it.  Voila, a SUNSTONE.
During your exploration around this forest, you should have found
 quite a few gems and jewels.  (i.e. Onyx, Topaz, Opal)
Anyhow, the other three birthstones you need are in order:
        (SUNSTONE) GARNET, TOPAZ, and RUBY.
To get rubies, grab a few from the ruby tree.  Use the yellow stone on
 your amulet after you've gotten your rubies.
Once you have all the right stones and have placed them in order, you
 will get a flute.
Now go to the bottom right screen of the forest.
Here is the entrance to the fiery dragon cave.
Let's go in.
Well, here's ol' Malcolm trying to stop you.
Once he throws one of his knives at you, throw it back at him.
Malcolm will chicken out but he shields the cave now.
Here's your chance to use your flute.

NOTE:  Before you enter the cave, make sure you have some empty slots in
       your pockets.  You will no longer need the flute nor the note.
       Nor do you need any gems.   Drop the apple outside of the cave.
       So you should only have a scroll when you enter the cave.

Enter the cave.


IN THE LABYRINTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Labyrinth is pretty deep and dark.
 If you wish to explore this labyrinth on your own, you can draw a grid
 map for yourself.  It'd make it a lot easier.

Here I will just direct you through the labyrinth from the cave entrance
where there is a pond of water:

 Go right.
 Go right.  (Gate will close behind you)
 Go right.  Pick up three fireberries here from the bush.
 Go up.  Drop a fireberry here.

 Go right.  Drop a fireberry here.
 Go up.  Pick up the rock.  Drop a fireberry here.

You should now have five rocks, two emeralds, a gold coin and a scroll.
Now return to the gate.

To make your life easier, go:
down, left, left, down, down, left, up, left, down, left, down, right,
down, left, left, left, up, up, up, right, up, up, left, left, left,
down, left, down, down, down, left, up, up, left, down, left.

Okay.  Put all the rocks on the counterweight thingio.  The gate opens.
Let's get out of here.
Go to the (wishing) well.
Drop in the golden coin.  Et voila, you have a moonstone.
Let's go back into the cave, and into the Pantheon of Moonlight.

To make your life easier again, start at the gate and go:
right, up, right, down, down, right, up, up, right, up, right, right.

Here we are at the Pantheon of Moonlight again.
Use the moonstone in the altar.  It should fit nicely.
Now the two purple wisps will combine into one and combine with you.
You now have a purple stone in your amulet.
 Eager to find out what the purple stone does?  Save it and see.
Click on the purple stone.  Your are now a ball of (purple) moonlight.

Travel:
right, right, right, right, down, down, left, down, left, down, right,
right, right, right, down, right.

Here we are.  You're at a river of fire.  You should shift back to your
 normal self now.
Use your magical scroll.
Go north.
Get the key.
Go south.
Click on the purple stone.

Travel:
left, up, left, left, left, left, up, up, up, up, left, left, left,
left, left, down, left, up, (cross chasm), up, and right.

We are finally out of this darn cave.


AREA 3:  (FOREST 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now I'm going to let your worry about your inventory.  When you run out
of room, drop an item somewhere, but make sure you can find it at your
convenience.

Go to your right two screens.  You will be clobbered by a tree.

You will wake up in Zanthia's home.
After a brief conversation, she will tell you to fetch magic water.
Pick up the empty bottle.
Go left three screens.
Here you meet Malcolm.
Malcolm has taken a magic lamp (or whatever) from the fountain.  You
 have to get it back.
I think you go all the way down, one screen to the left, and a few
 screens up.  You should find a place on fire.  If you are not in the
 right place, find it yourself.
Once you find this place, use your magical scroll once more.  This will
 be the last time you use this scroll so you can throw it away if you
 like.
Get the lamp and find your way back.
Use the lamp on the magical fountain and get some water.
Drink it.  You now have a blue stone in your amulet.
Get some more magic water.
Go three screens to your right to Zanthia.
Give Zanthia the magic water.
Another brief conversation with Zanthia and she'll tell you to gather
 some blueberries.
Go two screens to the left.  Here would be a great place to drop items
 which you might need later.  Such as the emeralds, gems, jewels.
Blueberries are:  extreme South, extreme Right, Up, right, up.
 Somewhere there.  It shouldn't be too hard to find.
Get one blueberry, it's all you need.
Go back to Zanthia and she'll probably tell you to get some fresh
 blueberries.
Go get another blueberry.  Come back to Zanthia and she should be gone.
Put the blueberry in the pot.  The liquid should turn bluish.

|| (YELLOW) TOPAZ + (YELLOW) TULIP = YELLOW POTION              (1)    ||
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go get your sapphire, rubies, tulip, topaz, apple and rose back in
forest 2.  You need the apple & rose for later on in the game.
Even though you've used the jewelry, they should reappear.

Make sure to click on the purple stone before you re-enter the cave.
Once in the cave.  Go all the way down and all the way to the left.
Get the items

To get the EXOTIC FLOWER go back to Zanthia's place and click on the
carpet.  You've discovered a secret doorway.  Go in.

AREA 4:  FOREST (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, the exotic flower, should be to the NORTH EAST.  (UP AND RIGHT).
The exotic flowers are on a beach where there are two golden unicorns at
the side of a chopper landing place.  Pick one up.

Go and mix your potions now.
Once you have a blue potion, a yellow potion, and 2 red potions.  Go
through the secret doorway again.

From here, go:
 2 screens down
 1 screen left
 2 screens down
 1 screen right
 1 screen up

You should now be at a place where there are two big green crystal
towers.

MIX BLUE POTION WITH RED POTION.
Result = magical purple potion.

MIX RED POTION WITH YELLOW POTION.
Result = magical orange potion.

These are all the potions you need throughout the rest of the game.  If
you want to play around with the other potions such as the magical
yellow, blue, and red potions then go ahead.  They're nothing special,
nothing to see.  Yellow tastes like furniture polish.  Blue gives you
hiccups.  And red tastes warm and good (chili?).

Well, since you have mixed these potions, let's go get the Royal
Chalice.  You may have seen this in forest 2.

Go back to Zanthia's place.  From there, go to the fountain.  Go down
and to the left.  The grail should be floating in the air here.
Click on the blue stone.

Hmmm... you didn't quite get the grail did you?  Let's go 1 screen to
the right.  Click on the door.

Drink the purple potion.  You're inside.
The pipsqueak wants something good.  So why not a rotten apple?
Give the pipsqueak the apple.
Go outside and get the royal chalice.
Once you have the royal chalice, let's go to the chopper landing site.
 (You know, the one with the two gold unicorn statues)

Once you are there, drink the orange potion.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Make sure you have the following before you drink the
                 orange potion:

                 the key
                 one lavender rose
                 the royal chalice


CASTLE LAND:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you reach the island, go to the right.
Put the rose on the grave.
Your mother will appear (as a ghost).  She will speak to you.

After a brief conversation with your mother, you will receive the last
stone of your amulet.  The red one.

Congratulations, you have followed my instructions accurately and have
finished the game!  Thanks to me.  Hmmm... I spent approximately 3 hours
writing this solution (entirely from memory) and come to think of it,
there is no reward.  What a waste of time.  I think this will be my last
solution.  Well, if you can do me a favour, call Syncronicity.  If you
have or had any problems with this solution, contact me at Syncronicity.
TTYL all.

                       By Charazz, Mad Hacker, & Obsidian

Ok...well, we'll start out in Joe's Bar. This is where you decide whether you 
want to be a boy or a girl. If you want to be a boy, go NW; if you wanna be a 
girl, go NE. The next thing to do is to GET STOOL. Then PISS. Then go back the
way you came, either SE or SW. Now for the fun part...type LEWD, then 19(for 
your age). Now WAIT until you're in the cell. GET ALL, OPEN DOOR, S(outh),

SUIT, OPEN HATCH, N.  Now you are matched up against an assassin with bad 
breath. So, you gotta kill him before he kills you. HIT THORBAST WITH SWORD, 
then press G until it says that his sword is coming toward you. This may take 
a long time, but it will work. If you wish, you may want to alternate between 
commands like swing sword, hit sword, kill assassin, etc. Anyway, once you
see that happen, GET HIS SWORD and then OFFER HIS SWORD TO THORBAST. Now with
Thorbast out of the way, HIT MONSTER WITH SWORD and UNSTRAP YOUNG WOMAN. Now
FOLLOW YOUNG WOMAN and you'll get the photo of Jean Harlow. Now OPEN DOOR and 
go E(ast). You have a fun time with Elysia and then go S(outh). Go S, MOUNT,

            The Legend of Robin Hood: Conquests of the Longbow

Druid Hand Code

(see Longbow1.IFF)

INTRODUCTION

   Welcome to CONQUESTS OF THE LONGBOW, my second game for Sierra On-Line
and my first using the new icon system.  By icon, we simply mean a 
visual symbol that stands for either an object to be used or an action
to be taken.

   Using the standard Sierra On-Line game icons is explained in the
separate game booklet, but I recommend you also read my sections here
on my two specially customized icons for this game: the BOW and the MAP.

   For less experienced players, you may wish to read the CLICK-THROUGH
to help you get started and to give you a few tips on getting into this
kind of an adventure game.

   Other sections in this book contain information and artwork that is
vital to solving certain puzzles and riddles in the game, so you'll want
to keep this book handy for reference.

   There's an explanation of how to play Nine Men's Morris, an ancient
board game which occurs in CONQUESTS OF THE LONGBOW, but for your
pleasure and for extra practice, you'll find a printed version of a 
Morris board included in this game package.

   When you've finished the game, I'd be delighted to receive your letters
of comment.  Detailed feedback from players on my first game was 
enormously valuable to me and helped me to improve this game. 

   Please, DON'T write to me for hints.  I answer every letter I receive,
but it may take me weeks or even months (depending on my work load) to
do so.  Sierra On-Line has lots of customer support for answering
hints.  I want to hear what you did or didn't like about any aspect of
this game.

   I'd like to thank everyone who wrote to me on the subject of piracy
to express your support and agreement that piracy is wrong, that it's a
thoughtless crime that ignores the fact that creative people work for 
long periods of time to put these games together and every time one
person copies a game and hands it out, or worse, sells it, that is money
taken directly away from me.  When I spend over a year of concentrated
work, I don't appreciate losing a penny of what I deserve by piracy.
It's not much different than someone stealing my purse.

   There were also long and lively letters examining the whole issue
of software piracy and copying.  I won't get into a long debate.  No,
perhaps it isn't a simple black and white issue, but one thing is
clear: piracy is theft and piracy is wrong.

   Some writers overseas told me of THOUSANDS of copies of my game being
pirated and sold.  It's infuriating to think that all my hard work is
being stolen out from under me in this way.

   One writer pointed out that it's something a company has to take into
account, the way a store takes into account a certain amount of
shoplifting.

   I don't see anyone condoning shoplifting on that basis.  So let's say
a company adds to the price of the product to cover the losses caused
by thousands and thousands of copies being pirated.  That means that
you, who PAY for this game, are PAYING for those pirates.  Hardly
fair, is it?

   The first step is awareness and enlightenment.  Refuse to allow or
participate in piracy.  It may be hard to say "no" to a friend who
innocently asks for a copy.  Instead, invite him or her over to play
it with you and explain why it's wrong to make copies.

   It's not just a matter of being illegal, it's a matter of ethics.
And it's also a matter or respect for me, my artists, my programmers,
my composer, and everyone else whose creative labors made the game 
possible in the first place.  Thank you for your continued support.

A HOOD!  A HOOD!
A HOOD!  A HOOD!
ROBIN HOOD!

   Was there really a Robin Hood?  As far as the best research can tell,
the answer is nay.  At least, no under that name.

   Pretty much everything I'll tell you here came from two excellent 
reference books: Robin Hood by J.C. Holt and The Outlaws of Medieval
Legend by Maurice Keen, both of which are listed in the bibliography.
I highly recommend them to any Robin Hood buff.

   There have been medieval bandits whose lives and "adventures" had
remarkable parallels to the ballads that sprang up about the mythical
Robin Hood.  I see Robin as a distillation of history and wish fulfillment
and just the plain human desire for a good rousing story with a likable
hero.

   The first known written reference to Robin Hood occurred around 1377 in
a piece of writing known as Piers Plowman  in which is mentioned "...I 
know rhymes of Robin Hood..."  This shows that by this time the ballads
and poems were well-enough known to rate a mention with the understanding
that those reading it would be familiar with it too.

   The earliest written material comes from five fragments of ballads
and poems and most of these dating to the 15th century, though it's
clear they were well known in the oral tradition for about 200 years
before that.

   From those early ballads, Robin emerged as a clever trickster, capable
of pulling off daring deceits in disguises.  His right-hand man, Little
John, often performed feats of disguise and daring of no less worth
than Robin's.  Sometimes it was Robin who rescued John and sometimes
the other way around.

   The earliest stories deal with Robin: helping the impoverished Knight
and robbing the Callarer of St. Mary's Abbey, whose money he then gives
to the Knight who has returned to pay his debt; disguising himself as a
Potter and tricking the Sheriff of Nottingham to entering the forest
with him; meeting up with Guy of Gisborne, with whom he has a shooting
match, but then must fight and kill with the sword, and using Guy's
disguise, he is able to rescue Little John from the Sheriff; being 
rescued by Little John and Much after he was captured going to church
in Nottingham; and his death where he is fatally bled by Prioress of
Kirklees (but Robin does NOT fire his final arrow to mark his resting
place in these verses).

   Many other stories, now well known, followed, but these are the seeds
from which they grew.  How many other tales have been lost because they
were never written down or the written form didn't survive is impossible
to guess.

   The only other outlaws besides Little John and Much the Miller's
son to appear in the earliest versions is Will Scarlet (also named
as Scarlock and Scathelocke).

   Of other famous figures that came to be attached to Robin Hood, Friar
Tuck didn't come along until 1417 when perhaps not so coincidentally a
certain real-life bandit by the name of Robert Stafford continued 
his outlaw ways under the title "Frere Tuk".

   Maid Marian, who seems so much a part of Robin Hood, entered the
myth from a curious direction for she was a figure in the May games.
She was derived from a French play that had nothing to do with Robin
Hood and was paired with the English Robin for the spring celebrations
sometime between 1450 and 1500.  The story of Marian entering the woods
disguised as a page and fighting with Robin wasn't written until around
the 18th century.

   The earliest King with whom Robin was associated wasn't Richard the
Lionheart, but an unspecified King Edward, probably Edward II.  The
firm attachment of Richard came later, was used by Sir Walter Scott
in Ivanhoe, and has been the one that stuck.

   The notion of Robin as a noble defender of the poor, of robbing from
the rich to give to the poor, also came along as a later addition.
These are social ideas that were entirely foreign to those who first
composed the ballads.

   Throughout the ages, Robin Hood as folk hero, as noble outlaw, as
skilled archer and clever trickster, has been shaped to fit each age
that loved him.  We continue to do so in our books, TV and movie versions.
And that's the way it should be.

   Robin isn't eternal because of which disguise he adopts or how he
happens to meet up with Marian or whether he wears green tights or
studded leather or any of the new embellishments we add to his tales.

   He lives on because he captures our hearts with his unchanging
essence - he fights the good fight, laughs boldly in the face of
danger, defies corrupt authority, and outwits his enemies to escape
and fight again.  Every age of humankind has a need for that kind
of hero.

THE DRUID TREES

In addition, here are other names which may be of interest:

   These illustrations show the trees, along with their English and
Druid names, which are used in Conquest of the Longbow.

   Around 52 B.C., Julius Caesar wrote of the Druids "They also hold
long discussions about the heavenly bodies and their movements, the size
of the universe and of the earth, the physical constitution of the world,
and the power and the properties of the gods..."   

   Little is known about the long-lost Druids.  There are bits and pieces
found in the writings of Caesar and other Roman historians and some
surviving oral tradition.  Unfortunately, the Druid's religion was against
putting their knowledge into written form.  What is also seldom mentioned
is how powerful and important the Druidesses were within their structure.
It was Velleda, Druid High-Priestess of Germany and Gaul who led a major
rebellion against the Romans in 70 B.C. (and, tragically, lost and was
executed in Rome).

   We know the Druids believed in reincarnation and that their strongest
beliefs centered around the Oak and Mistletoe.  Sacred groves were vital
to them and were centers of worship.

   Amongst the ancient works that have survived is the Cad Goddeu, Welsh
for "The Battle of the Trees", a long poem in which secret names were
encoded within verses about sacred trees.  Certain letters of the 
alphabet were associated with certain trees.  Trees were also associated
with specific months and lunar cycles.

NINE MEN'S MORRIS GAME

   Morris could easily be one of the oldest, still-played board games in 
the world.  It's been found scratched into the roof of a 1400 B.C. Egyptian
temple, in the ruins of Troy, in a Bronze Age tomb in Ireland, and in the
burial ship of a Viking king.  "Morris" seems to have come from the French
name for the game, "merelles".

   This is a two person game.  Each player has 9 pieces.  Anything will do:
9 dimes and 9 pennies, 9 poker chips of 2 colors, etc.  

   There are 24 "points" on the board where a piece may be placed.  These
are the corners of the squares and the places where the connecting lines
intersect.

   The object of the game is to create "mills" and remove your opponent's 
pieces from the board until he only has 2 pieces left or is unable to make 
any moves.

   A "mill" is 3 of the same player's pieces laid in a row with no vacant 
points between them.

   Each time a player moves one of her pieces so that she creates a new 
mill, she can remove one of her opponent's pieces.

Here are some examples of valid mills.

(see Longbow1.IFF)

Pieces that line up diagonally or without being connected by a line do not
count.

This is not a valid mill:

(see Longbow1.IFF)

   How to begin: determine, however you like, which player gets the first 
move.  That player may place 1 of his pieces on any vacant point (remember, 
there are 24 points).  Then the other player places 1 piece.  They take 
turns placing pieces until all 9 pieces have been placed on the board.

   While the players put down the 9 pieces, each one should be trying to do 
2 things: create a mill; or prevent the other player from creating a mill.

   Once all remaining pieces (not counting any lost because the opponent 
created a mill) have been placed on the board, the second part of the game 
is for the players to continue taking turns moving 1 of their pieces to an 
adjacent vacant point on the board.  A player may not jump over her own or 
another player's piece and moves must be made along the lines only.  A 
piece cannot jump across spaces.

   A player who has made a mill may not take a piece from one of his 
opponent's mills unless there are no other pieces to take.

   A new mill may be formed by a player moving one of her pieces from an 
existing mill (so it's no longer a mill) in one turn and moving it back 
into the same place to recreate the mill on her next turn (provided the 
other player doesn't block the space in the meantime).

And that's it.  Have fun!

CUSTOMIZED ICONS

   Please see the other game manual for explanations of how the standard
icons work.  For Conquests of the Longbow, I have two customized icons
as explained below.

BOW: The BOW ICON works in a similar fashion to the other icons.  You may
cycle through the CURSORS until you reach the BOW CURSOR or go up to the
Menu Bar, click on the BOW ICON and you will have the BOW CURSOR.

Now you may click the BOW CURSOR onto the object or person you wish to 
shoot with the bow.  Stop and think before you shoot your bow.  Just 
because you're Robin Hood doesn't mean you should shoot everything in 
sight.  There could be serious consequences in threatening the wrong person 
with the bow.

   For POINT OF VIEW ARCHERY (where you're sighting down your nocked arrow 
ready to fire), the BOW CURSOR is moved up, down, left and right until your 
arrow head is positioned where you want it, then clicking will fire the 
arrow.

   Click on your bow hand to load another arrow, if you wish to fire again.

MAP: The MAP ICON does not appear as a cursor.  To use the MAP, go to the 
Menu Bar and click on the MAP ICON there.  It will instantly take you to 
the appropriate map so you may travel to the next location you want.

   Directions within Sherwood Forest are north (top of screen), west (left 
side of screen), south (bottom of screen) and east (right side of screen).  
One exception to this is the Watling Street Overlook.  To orient yourself, 
remember that Watling Street runs roughly north-south (as you can see from 
the Shire Map).

   You may walk through the forest at great length, but if you're in a 
hurry, simply click on the MAP ICON in the Menu Bar.  The main map of 
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE (the Shire Map) will appear.  Click the WALK CURSOR on a 
travel point of this Shire map to travel there.  This includes Watling 
Street, certain places in the Forest, the town of Nottingham and the 
Monastery in the Fens.

   The MAP is provided as a shortcut method that you should find very 
useful throughout the game.  Not only will it take you quickly to special 
parts of the forest, it allows you to jump to many points north and south 
along Watling Street itself.  The MAP ICON will not work when inside a 
building and in other special locations and situations.

   Clicking on the town of Nottingham from the Shire map will bring you to 
a map view of the town.  Clicking WALK on any of the available locations of 
the town will take you to that specific location.

   Selecting MAP while on the streets of Nottingham will bring you back to 
the Nottingham map, and selecting MAP again will bring you back to the main 
Shire map.

USING MONEY

   Anytime you're carrying money, it will be represented inside Inventory 
by a single silver penny.  If you have no money left at all, no coin will 
appear in Inventory.

   In England at that time, this was the one English coin and it was cut in 
half to make a ha'penny, or cut into four pieces to make farthings.  A 
penny in 1193 was made of pure silver and was worth a great deal more than 
we think of a penny being worth today, so don't confuse the word "penny" 
with being an insignificant amount of money.

   To give specific amounts of money, click on INVENTORY, then click the
INVENTORY SELECTOR onto the penny.  The penny becomes the selected 
Inventory Item and appears as the selected item in the Menu Bar.

   Now you can click through the cursors or select the penny from the Menu 
Bar to be the active cursor and click the Money Cursor onto a person or 
thing.  A special MONEY WINDOW will open up and show you how many pennies, 
ha'pennies or farthings you have left to give.

   The amount you have appears in the column on the left.  To the right of 
this is a column of PURSE ICONS.  Click on the Purse Icons to put points 
back into your purse after you've chosen to take them out.

   In the center column you will see a penny, ha'penny and farthing to 
identify which coin you're selecting.

   In the next column to the right is a row of HAND ICONS.  Click as many 
times as you want on the Hand icons to choose the exact amount of money you 
want to give.  For example, if you want to give someone a penny and 2 
farthings, click one time on the Hand Icon to the right of the penny and 2 
times on the Hand Icon to the right of the farthing.

   The amount of coins you've chosen to remove from your purse will appear 
in the column to the right of the Hand Icon.

   You still have the choice to GIVE the money or KEEP the money.  Click on 
one of these two boxes at the bottom to make your final choice.  This will
close the Money Window and give the money to the person or thing, if you
chose to do so.  If you clicked on KEEP, or if you clicked on GIVE but 
didn't have any coins selected next to the Hand Icons, it will be the same 
as not giving any money at all.

Also, to simply find out how much money you have without having to call up 
the Money Window, open the Inventory window and click the INVENTORY LOOK 
onto the coin.  A message will appear to tell you how many of each coin you 
have.

SCORING

   Across the top of the screen in what we call the Status Line, you'll see 
three items: RANSOM, OUTLAWS, SCORE.

   RANSOM will show you the total amount of ransom you've managed to raise 
toward saving King Richard as the game progresses.  Your actions and how 
you use your wits has a large effect on the amount you can raise.

OUTLAWS shows how many of your men survive throughout the game.  Your 
skill, cunning and choice of strategies will make a big difference in how 
many outlaws live or die, which reflects upon your ability as a leader.

SCORE is your continuing gain or loss of points as you play through the 
game as compared to the total number of points that can be earned.

ARCADE SETTINGS

   By ARCADE, I refer to places in the game where a situation is solved by 
use of reflexes, timing and visual skills (such as the Point of View 
archery).  There are very few places in CONQUESTS OF THE LONGBOW where this 
happens, but it is possible for those people who don't like Arcade 
sequences to bypass them.

   To do this, click on the COMPUTER ICON in the Menu Bar (second from the
right).  A window will open up showing a number of game selection buttons
and some slider bars.  The slider bar on the far right is for your ARCADE
setting.  Use your cursor to slide to any setting between MOST DIFFICULT 
("+") and EASIEST ("-").

   If you slide the bar ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM of the scale (the "-"
direction), you will automatically WIN and bypass the Arcades altogether.  
You should be able to change this setting at any time during the game.

   NOTE #1: Using the WIN selection will reduce the total score you can 
earn.

   NOTE #2: The game of Nine Men's Morris involves strategy and cleverness,
so the WIN position will not allow you to automatically win this game.  
However, your setting of Easy to Difficult will determine your opponent's 
skill level.

QUARTERSTAFF

   You have 4 offensive moves (strikes) and 4 defensive moves (parries, 
ducking and jumping).

OFFENSIVE MOVES

OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW: This move brings your staff down from a high overhead.
This is your most powerful blow, but it also leaves your guard wide open 
for a counterattack.

   HEAD STRIKE: Strikes at your foe's head.
   BODY STRIKE: Strikes at your foe's mid-torso.
   LEG STRIKE: Strikes at your foe's lower legs.

DEFENSIVE MOVES

OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW PARRY: Parries with staff above the head to stop your
foe's most powerful overhead attack.

   DUCKING HEAD: Causes you to duck underneath your foe's strike at your 
                 head.
   BODY PARRY: Parries with staff an attack at your mid-torso.

   JUMPING UP TO AVOID LEG STRIKE: Causes you to jump up and avoid your 
                                   foe's attempt to strike your legs.

USING A MOUSE

If you have a mouse, you need to click on or near a certain area of Robin's 
body or your foe's body in order to attack or defend.  Here is how it 
works:

OFFENSIVE MOVES:

OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW: Click above your foe's head.
HEAD STRIKE: Click on your foe's head.
BODY STRIKE: Click on your foe's body.
LEG STRIKE: Click below your foe's knees.

DEFENSIVE MOVES:

OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW PARRY: Click above Robin's head.
DUCKING HEAD: Click on Robin's head.
BODY PARRY: Click on Robin's body.
JUMPING UP TO AVOID LEG STRIKE: Click below Robin's knees.

USING A KEYBOARD

If you have only a keyboard, use your numerical keys as follows:

7 DUCKING HEAD      8 OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW    9 HEAD STRIKE
4 BODY PARRY        5                        6 BODY STRIKE
1 JUMPING UP TO     2 OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW    3 LEG STRIKE
  AVOID LEG STRIKE    PARRY                   

USING A JOYSTICK

If you have a joystick, move to one of the 8 positions and click


                        OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW
                                 |
                  DUCKING HEAD \ | / HEAD STRIKE
                                \|/
                    BODY PARRY --o-- BODY STRIKE    
                                /|\
JUMPING UP TO AVOID LEG STRIKE / | \ LEG STRIKE  
                                 |               
                     OVERHEAD GREAT BLOW PARRY

WARNING

On the following pages you'll find a "Click-Through" which gives tips
and instructions for starting the game.

If you're new to this sort of game, you may wish to read the Click-
Through to help you get a feel for how to play.

If you're an experienced game player, you may wish to skip reading 
this so that no puzzles or discoveries are given away ahead of time.

CLICK-THROUGH

   When the game begins, you'll find yourself standing in your cave which 
lies inside the Outlaw Camp.

   Click the EYE CURSOR onto various objects in the cave to gather 
information about what is there that you might want.

   Click the HAND CURSOR onto the horn.  The horn in now in your Inventory.  
To check this, go to the menu bar and click on Inventory.  A window will 
open up to show you that you're carrying the horn.  Click the INVENTORY 
SELECTOR to make the horn your Inventory Item.  Click on "OK" to close the 
Inventory window.

   Click the HORN CURSOR on yourself to blow the horn.

   Click HAND on the small chest to take money.  If you like, you may open 
your Inventory again to see the silver penny which shows that you have 
money.

   Walk outside to your Outlaw Camp.

   Once you've spoken with the men who greet you outside, observe the 
direction in which Little John went to reach the Overlook, and the 
direction Will Scarlet took to the glade.

   Leave the camp by going northeast, the direction Will took.

   Continue to travel north through two forest scenes and you'll come to 
the Shooting Glade.

   Click TALK on Will.  You may also TALK to the other outlaw.
 
   Click HAND on the garland hanging on the tree.

   Click BOW on the tree or garland.

   You'll now be sighting down your own arrow, nocked on your longbow, 
ready to fire.  Move the BOW CURSOR until you've positioned the arrowhead 
where you want it to be released.  Click the BOW CURSOR to fire the arrow.  
Click on your bow hand to nock another arrow.

   When you've had enough practicing, click the WALK CURSOR anywhere to 
leave this scene.

   Walk south to the Outlaw Camp.  Then walk due west through 3 forest 
scenes until you come to the Watling Street Overlook.  From this ridge, you 
will be able to see the street down below without being seen.  Pay 
attention to what Little John tells you.

   Remain where you are after Little John has greeted you and left.  Soon, 
you'll see a Sheriff's Man dragging a peasant woman down the street.  Click 
EYE on them to get more information.

To intercept them, walk down the ridge or to the left of the screen, or 
click WALK on the road, or click HAND on the man or woman.

You will come onto Watling Street and confront the Sheriff's Man.  This 
would be a good place to Save your Game.  Think carefully, for what you may 
do, say, or offer, will determine this woman's fate.

ADDITIONAL TIPS

Sometimes you need to talk to a person more than once to learn all he or 
she has to say.  You might click TALK on the same character a number of 
times before the character begins to repeat himself.

Stop and save games often, especially when you think you're coming up on a 
dangerous situation.

her, shoot the sheriff's officer with your bow and arrow.


Problem:
What should I do at the shooting glade?

Hint:
Be sure to  talk to Will and young Simon. If you like, you  can also show them
your excellent marksmanship by shooting the targets on  the trees. However, if
you'd  like to  skip your marksmanship practice,  set the  Arcade level to the
easiest setting.

	Days 5 and 6, Fens Monk
 
Problem:
No one is on Watling Street. How do I proceed?

Hint:
Before you go to Watling Street, you need to visit the widow's cottage to find
out the news about her sons. Then go to the Watling  Street Overlook and watch
for a Fens Monk to come down the street. He'll be wearing black.Click the hand
cursor on him to encounter him on Watling Street.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Fens Monk?

Hint:
Click the hand  cursor on him. To get  the Fens Monk's robe, click the bow and
arrow cursor  on him, accept his  challenge, and defeat him with Little John's
staff. Use this Monk's robe as a disguise for the day's events.


Problem:
How do I cross the Fens?

Hint:
When you defeated  the Fens  Monk on  Watling Street  and took  his robe for a
disguise,you'll notice he was carrying a reed instrument. Blow this whistle at
the edge of the Fens and another Fens Monk will pick you  up in a boat to take
you to the Monastery.


Problem:
How do I get past the guard of the Fens Monk Monastery?

Hint:
You need to give the guard two items. First, give him  the whistle made from a
marsh  reed. Then  give  him  the  bag  of  gemstones.  You'll  need your game
documentation to correctly identify the gemstones.


Problem:
What do I do inside the Fens Monk Monastery?

Hint:
You need  to do three things. First,  visit  the Prior in  the Refectory. Then
visit Fulk and release him from the Torture Room. Find the  Prior again in the
Scroll Room, spill wine on him and take Fulk's scroll. Also while you're still
in the Scroll Room, find and take Marian's scroll.


Problem:
How can I obtain Marian's scroll?

Hint:
When you enter the Scroll Room, click the eye cursor on  the scroll rack. This
will bring up a close-up view of the scroll rack. Now click the hand cursor on
each of the scrolls until you find Marian's. You might also  wish to read each
of these scrolls carefully. One of them contains a clue for another part of
the game.


Problem:
I'm having trouble getting Fulk's scroll!

Hint:
After you've released Fulk from the chains in the  torture room, return to the
Scroll Room. Here  you'll see  the Prior  reading Fulk's  scroll at  his desk.
You'll notice the Prior's goblet of wine on the desk. Walk  up behind his wine
goblet and click the hand cursor on it. Of course, wine will spill everywhere.
When the Prior leaves the room in disgust, take the scroll from the desk.


Problem:
How do I get past the iron grate?

Hint:
Did you  examine the other  scrolls in the  scroll room? One  scroll "seems to
speak  of  the  history  of this  very  fortress"  and  gives a hint about the
gargoyles surrounding the iron grate. First, you need to click the hand cursor
on "the Gargoyle  with the thoughtful face," then on "the Gargoyle with a lean
and hungry look," then finally on "the foolish looking Gargoyle." Now the iron
grate will open up and you and Fulk can escape.


	Days 5 and 6, Abbey Monk
 
Problem:
No one is on Watling Street. How do I proceed?

Hint:
Before you go to Watling Street, you need to visit the widow's cottage to find
out the news about her sons. Then go to the Watling  Street Overlook and watch
for an Abbey Monk to come  down Watling Street. He'll  be wearing brown. Click
the hand cursor on him to encounter him on Watling Street.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Abbey Monk?

Hint:
Use this Monk's  robe as a disguise for the day's events. Just click  the hand
cursor on him. He'll be so afraid of you that he'll  give up his clothes. Also
be sure to visit the widow today.


Problem:
What should I do in the Abbey?

Hint:
You need to do four things. First, go to the laundry room and get three robes.
Second, explore the hedge maze behind the Abbey and  note the quickest path to
the secret door. Next,meet the Abbot in the refectory and take his ale cask to
the pub for a refill.Get the Abbot drunk and then take the puzzle box from his
bedroom. You will have to wait for a safer place to open the puzzle box.


Problem:
What must I do at the pub?

Hint:
There are  two things to  do in the pub today. First,  refill the Abbot's  ale
cask.  To  do  this,  you  need  to get  the  empty  ale cask from the Abbot's
refectory. Go back to the Abbey and return with the empty cask. Give the empty
cask to the Innkeeper,and he'll be much more cooperative. Be sure to play Nine
Men's Morris and win the amethyst.


Problem:
I keep getting thrown out of the Abbey, or end up drunk!

Hint:
Accept the Abbot's challenge and drink with him. But first,you need to win the
amethyst by  playing Nine Men's  Morris in the pub. You can  slip the amethyst
into your mug after the first glass of ale has been poured.


Problem:
The Abbot's room is locked! How can I enter?

Hint:
Get the Abbot drunk! This means you'll need to go to  the Refectory and accept
his challenge to drink. He will instruct one  of the other monks to  leave his
door unlocked. If you use the amethyst wisely,you'll drink him under the table
and be able to walk right into his room yourself.


Problem:
Ok.. the Abbot is drunk, what do I do next?

Hint:
Search the Abbot and lift his purse.Grab the empty ale cask from the table. Go
search the Abbot's room for the puzzle box he was playing with earlier. You'll
find it under the third pillow on his bed.


Problem:
How do I open the puzzle box?

Hint:
You might wait until another day to open this puzzle. You won't be needing the
contents until  Day Ten. The  key to opening  it is in  reading Fulk's scroll.
Looking at the scroll,write down the first letter of each name of a Druid tree
listed there.These first letters will give you the Latin word you need to open
the puzzle box. Select the puzzle box from inventory  with the hand cursor and
punch in these letters.


Problem:
How do I help the widow's boys escape?

Hint:
Go to the pub and pay the Abbot's bill of twelve pennies.Give the pub keep the
empty ale cask.  Exit the pub through the secret cave in the back  by clicking
the hand  cursor on the  iron door to  the back room  of the pub,  then on the
spigot  of the  second cask  in the back room.  Find the  secret door into the
guard's room and click the eye cursor on the hole in the door. Eventually, the
guards will  slip out of the room to get some  money for ale. Enter  the room,
place four pennies on the table and exit back into the tunnel. When the guards
leave, enter  the room and  click the hand cursor on the  trapdoor. Select the
robes from  inventory and click them on the opening of  the trapdoor. When the
four of you are back in the tunnel,exit through the pub. When Robin is stopped
and asked to bless the kneeling, drunken Sheriff, click the talk cursor on the
Sheriff.

Problem:
What should I do when I encounter Marian?

Hint:
You need  to give her  the hand scroll you got from  the Fens Monk  Monastery.
Also, give her the heart-shaped half emerald.


Problem:
How do I summon the Green Man?

Hint:
Remember the golden net the widow gave you?  If she hasn't given it  to you by
Day Seven, go visit her. You can use  this net to capture a  Pixie, one of the
wood sprites. The Pixie will introduce you to the Green Man. Talk to the Green
Man and he'll challenge you with three riddles.


Problem:
What should I do with the Golden Net?

Hint:
You can  use this net to capture a Pixie, one  of the wood sprites.  The Pixie
will introduce you to the Green Man.


Problem:
Enough already! What are the answers to the Green Man's riddles?

Hint:
Refer to  your game documentation to learn the  letters in the  hand code. The
answer to the riddle that begins "I am the heart.." is wood. The answer to the
riddle that  begins "High born, my touch.." is snow. The  answer to the riddle
that begins  "I am the  outstretched fingers.." is feather. The answer  to the
riddle that begins "Golden treasure I  contain.." is beehive.The answer to the
riddle that begins "My first master has  four legs.." is fur.The answer to the
riddle that begins "Metal or bone I may be.."is comb. The answer to the riddle
that begins "Not  born but from a mother's body  drawn.." is cheese.The answer
to the  riddle that begins  "I am two-faced  but bear only  one.."is coin. The
answer to the riddle that begins "I am a window.." is eye.


Problem:
What should I do on Day Eight?

Hint:
There  are three  things you  need to   do on  Day Eight. First go  to Watling
Overlook and observe the Yeoman on Watling street. Confront the Yeoman and pay
him for his  clothes. Second, attend the fair and give the hand scroll  to the
scholar  who shows  you the  correct coat of arms.  Finally, enter the archery
tournament and win the golden arrow.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Yeoman on Watling Street?

Hint:
Offer him some money. He'll give you his clothes for a disguise.


Problem:
What should I do at the Fair?

Hint:
You need to do two things at the fair. First,locate a scholar who can show you
the  correct  coat-of-arms  you're  asking  to see.  You  can  find a complete
selection of coats-of-arms in your game documentation. When  the scholar shows
you the  correct coat-of-arms, give him the hand  scroll from Marian.  Second,
enter the archery tournament and win the golden arrow.



	Days 9, 10, and 11

Problem:
What must I do on Day Nine?

Hint:
You must do three things.You must escape the sheriff's men when they sweep the
forest.  You must  encounter the jeweler on  Watling Street. Finally, disguise
yourself as  either Puck, using his Yeoman's clothes, or as  the Jeweler, then
visit the Sheriff of Nottingham.


Problem:
How can I evade the sheriff's men?

Hint:
When the sheriff's men are chasing you, run to the ancient Oak. You'll need to
call upon the  Green Man's protection. To gain the Green Man's protection, you
must  have  answered   his  three  riddles  on  Day  Eight.  Using  your  game
documentation find the  Druid name for the oak. Click the hand cursor on Robin
and enter this Druid name using the hand code.Robin will transform into a tree
and the sheriff's men will walk right by him.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the jeweler?

Hint:
There  are three  possible ways  to complete this encounter.  You can  let the
jeweler go on his way, in which case you'll use your Yeomans disguise to visit
the  Sheriff. You  could give  the jeweler the heart-shaped  half emerald, and
he'll  gladly trade  you his  clothes. If you give  him the  emerald, you  can
complete the  game, but Marian  will die on another day. A  third option is to
simply click  the hand cursor  on him twice. This is the  best option to take,
because  you'll get  his clothes  for  a disguise and  he'll still  be happily
rewarded.


Problem:
How can I get in to see the Sheriff?

Hint:
If you fail  to get the Jeweler's disguise, put on the Yeoman disguise.  Go to
Nottingham Castle  and bribe the guard--a penny will  do. Keep talking  to the
Sheriff and you'll convince him to come with you,or make a wager by giving him
three pennies. This will end Day Nine.


Problem:
What should I do on Day Ten?

Hint:
You need to rescue Marian, and either heal her in the  Willow Grove or let her
die.


Problem:
How do I rescue Marian?

Hint:
While in your camp, blow your horn to assemble the men.  When you're given the
choice, follow John's subterfuge plan. Go to the Pub and talk to the Innkeeper
several times.He'll let you use the back way into the Abbey Monk Monastery. At
the Monastery, travel through the hedge  maze to find the  witch's court. When
you get to the entrance  of the Witch's  Court, select the  ring that commands
fire from inventory and click  it on Robin.  Now click the  hand cursor on the
door.


Problem:
I keep getting burned up trying to rescue Marian!

Hint:
Put on the ring that commands fire from your inventory before rescuing Marian.
You found this ring by  opening the puzzle  box from the  Abbot's room in  the
Abbey Monk Monastery.


Problem:
I've rescued Marian, but now she's dying!

Hint:
Select the half emerald from inventory and click it on Marian  to heal her. If
you don't have the half emerald, she will die. However, you can still complete
the game without her.


Problem:
How do I ambush the treasure train?

Hint:
Blow your  horn to call your men together. Choose Tuck's  plan. Ambush with an
element of surprise. It will work splendidly!



	Days 12 and 13

Problem:
What should I do on Day Twelve?

Hint:
You need to avoid the sheriff's men in the forest and  then encounter a knight
on Watling Street.


Problem:
How do I avoid the sheriff's men in the forest?

Hint:
The same way you avoided them the first time they swept the forest!


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter a knight on Watling Street?

Hint:
This is a false knight! Talk to him and then try to give him the password from
Marian using the hand code. When you do this a second time, Robin will realize
he's a false knight. Immediately select your bow and  arrow from inventory and
shoot him. When he is on the ground, search him. Now you'll have evidence that
he was plotting against the King. Blow your horn to call Little John.


Problem:
What should I do on Day Thirteen?

Hint:
Day Thirteen is the final day of the game. If Marian  has died, you'll need to
visit her spirit in the Willow Grove. If you know the password, you can rescue
the Queen's Knight from the Fens Monk Monastery, then stand trial to determine
your fate.

 
Problem:
How do I cross the Fens Marsh?

Hint:
Select  the ring  that commands water from  inventory and  wear it. You'll see
Will-O'-the-Wisps floating over the Fens Marsh.Click the talk cursor on one of
the Wisps.  They'll let you  cross if  you've visited or healed  Marian in the
willow grove and received a password.


Problem:
I can't locate Marian's spirit in the Willow Grove!

Hint:
If Marian has died you need to use the hand code to call up her spirit. You'll
need your game documentation for this  one. Look up the  Druid name for Willow
and enter it using the  hand code. You'll  receive a password  to give to  the
knight.


Problem:
How do I enter the Fens Monastery?

Hint:
You'll need your game documentation for  this one. Look up  the Druid name for
ivy and enter it using the hand code. The ivy on the  wall will grow and grow.
You'll be able to climb the wall using the ivy.


Problem:
The Queen's Knight won't go with me!

Hint:
Remember the password Marian gave  you in the  Willow Grove? Well,  enter this
password using the  hand code. The knight will go with you. After crossing the
Fens, and  the knight is safe, you'll stand  trial and your  fate as an outlaw
will be determined.Congratulations! You've completed Conquests of the Longbow!

THE LORD OF THE RINGS - SOLUTION - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PART 1 (played as Frodo)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Open the drawer, chest, cupboard and door, take one of the canvas backpacks
and put into it the matchbox, bottle and food. Go east, then south to the
main highway, the west until you reach the turn-off for the town hall. Go
north and then east to meet the Mayor. Now go west, south, west and west to
enter the Mathom House (if the guard refuses you entrance, just WEAR RING
and go west). In here take the book and the candle. Then go west until you
are back at the highway outside your cottage, then go east, north-east,
north-east, south-east, south and east (through the yellow door) to find
Merry. EAT MEAL until it's finished and go west and north. If there are no
riders about go east and then south-east into the forest with the trees that
move. If the riders are present then go north, south, east and south-east
into the forest (moves east and west are fatal when the riders are about, 
but others are usually safe until they've gone).
 In the forest you need to remember two locations, the wide glade and the
grassy glade. To pass from the wide to the grassy you need to go east,
so just type WAIT and then EAST until the trees let you pass. In the grassy
glade it's the same, except that you want to go south-east to find the 
hilltop. At the hilltop go south to the riverbank then north-east to the
willow. At this point your companions should fall asleep, so go north-east
to Tom Bombadil and SAY TO TOM "HELP". Now return to the willow and WAIT.
As soon as they are free go north-east to Tom's and EAT MEAL until it's
finished. Thank Tom then go east until you meet the Barrow Wight. Now tell
your companions to take a sword each, then WEAR RING and go east. 
At the gate, TAKE OFF RING and KNOCK. When asked, SAY TO GATEKEEPER "FRODO"
and then SAY TO SAM "GO SOUTH-WEST AND OPEN RED DOOR". Once sam has gone
go south-west and then south into the store. Here take all the food supplies
and then SAY TO SAM "GO NORTH AND KILL A BLACK RIDER". Do the same with
Pippin, and when Sam returns tell him to do it again. WAIT until they both
return and then go north and west and SAY TO STRANGER "HELLO". Now WAIT for
Strider to leave, then FOLLOW STRIDER and continue to do so until you find 
the flat stone. READ STONE and WAIT, then Strider will go off again so
FOLLOW STRIDER once more until you reach the Fortress Of Fornost. Here WAIT
until the Starling talks to Strider and then FOLLOW STRIDER back to the gate.
Now WAIT twice and them go east, WAIT twice more and go east again. Around 
this point the Black Riders should enter, so go north and then east to the
bare hilltop and WAIT five times. Now go south and FOLLOW STRIDER.
At the bridge Strider will stop, so SAY TO STRIDER "GO EAST" (you will have
to do this at least twice). When he agrees to follow you, go east until
you can go no further and Part One is complete.

NOTE REGARDING BLACK RIDERS:
 This solution depends on timing to avoid the Black Riders, but the 'correct'
way to pass time is to use the pale green jewels. The following routine
should enable you to learn the words needed to release their powers:
 Go to the lake, then w, w, s, sw, s, e, ne, sw, w, s, to locate the Monk
who will tell you what to do next. Then go n, w, n, w, s to locate the
Green Knight. Attack and defeat him and make sure you take the Broken
Medallion that he leaves behind. Then back to Monk, then, n, e, se, to
locate the Red Lady, kill her and take her medallion. Return to monk and
you should be allowed to pass through the stone door to the south of him,
where you will find yet another door. Knock and wait until Radagast answers 
and he should give you the scroll with the magic words on. Now whenever you
encounter the Black Riders, make sure that Frodo, Pippin and Sam are
carrying one jewel each and type in magic words to get rid of Riders.
Give any spare jewels to Merry to carry.

GENERAL TIPS
1)Keep up your strength by eating at regular intervals.
2)If the riders enter the same location as yourself, go any direction bar
  east and west.
3)Elfstones can be found in the willow (Pippin will be carrying them when
  he is rescued), at the top of a tree that can be climbed by Hobbits
  and in a plant pot (TAKE THE PLANT and EXAMINE POT).
4)If you ever visit farmer Maggott's farm, just WAIT three times when dogs
  arrive and all will be well.
5)If you must go via the tunnel, then light the candle before you enter it
  (OPEN MATCHBOX, LIGHT MATCH, LIGHT CANDLE WITH MATCH).
6)If you want to use the ferry than take it in turns to wind the handle.
7)If you really want to live like a Hobbit, then you need to get the pouch
  and a pipe. Now OPEN POUCH, FILL PIPE and LIGHT MATCH (as before).
  Then LIGHT PIPE WITH MATCH and enjoy a good smoke of the pipeweed.

PART 2
~~~~~~
 Go north-east and north and you should encounter a small brown pony, then 
go south-west to meet Glorfindel. Talk to him and he will tell you that he
has been sent to guide you. Go south and then east, then RIDE STALLION and
SAY TO STALLION "GO EAST" as soon as you see the Black Riders approaching.
Continue east until you have crossed the ford, then GET OFF STALLION and
WAIT until your companions appear. Go east to Elrond's courtyard, then 
north and east until you meet Bilbo. EAT MEAL until it's finished, then
FOLLOW BILBO to his bedroom. WAIT for him to speak, then SAY TO BILBO "NO"
and repeat until he gives you the sword. Then WAIT and he will also give 
you the Mithril Shirt. WEAR SHIRT then go west, east, south, west to meet
the council of Elrond. When the meeting is over and you are assembled
outside, WAIT and the pony will be laden with supplies. Proceed south, 
south, south-west, south-east and then WAIT again. Go south-east and WAIT.
 Go south-west and WAIT yet again. Now take Strider's advice and EAT. Then go
south-east and at this point distribute the bundles of cakes amongst the
company (e.g. SAY TO BOROMIR "TAKE CAKES"). Go east until you encounter
the outline of a door upon the rock, EXAMINE DOOR and then SAY TO DOOR 
"FRIEND". At this point you will be grabbed by the tentacle (ouch!), so
ATTACK TENTACLES and when they release you, go east.
 In the mines, go u, e, e, e, d, d, w, w, w, d, and you should be in a
corridor (but see note 2). PUSH HORSE and the slab will open, so now go east,
e, e, u, and east and you should be in a room with a book and a stone block
in it, along with a pile of armour. READ BOOK and EXAMINE BLOCK in order to
hear a noise in the corridor. WAIT and when they enter, ATTACK ORCS. Now go
east and WAIT. When Gandalf talks to you, go east and LIGHT CANDLE WITH
MATCH. Go down, d, s, d, south until you enter the square room. If all the
party are not with you, you can backtrack at this point to round them up.
When all are present, s, d, and then proceed east until you get to the
bridge. WAIT on the bridge and Gandalf will tell you to flee, so go east
until you emerge into Dimrill Dale then WAIT and FOLLOW GIMLI. Now head
south-east until you arrive on the eastern bank of the Nimrodel. When the
elf enters, WAIT, then proceed east to the river. Here the best policy is to
SAY TO ELF "HELP" and then SAY TO GIMLI "GO NORTH-WEST". When he has gone,
you must go north-east over the rope and then WAIT. Now go west and WAIT
again. When the doors have opened, head east to the tree and then go up,
then SAY TO GALADRIEL "HELP". When she has replied, climb down and go west
to the bridge but do not cross it. Now go south until you reach the banks of
the Anduin river and your quest is complete.

NOTE:
1)There are many other incidents and happenings along the way, this is just
  one solution, but it is impossible in a game with so many variables to
  include a comprehensive guide to everything. If you have managed to get 
  through the game once, however, you should then be able to go back and
  explore the complexity of it some more.
2)If the route given above when entering the mines doesn't work, try instead
  going up, e, e, e, d, d, w, d, s, d.
3)If Gimli insists on killing the Tactiturn Elf then you can either send him
  away or else try to take his axe from him.
4)The above solution relies on timing to avoid the black riders, as follows:
  After the Starling has talked to Strider, return to the gate of Bree and
  WAIT twice, then go east and and WAIT twice more. Now go e, n, e, e, and
  WAIT five times before heading south then east over the bridge. In case of
  problems, just try varying the number of times you WAIT in each place until
  you find the correct sequence to enable you to pass over the bridge in 
  safety.

   Well, welcome to the game cheat for Leisure Suit Larry 3, typed up quite
faithfully by The Timelord and Low Rider... As you may know, we are the main
support boards for a new organization, GPA. I would like to take the time to
thank WCA for copying our release of Leisure Suit Larry 3, it is soo nice to
log onto a BBS and find LSL3S1.ZIP, then unzip it and see things like:
WCAPLUG.ANS, and INTRO.WCA, umm, yeah guys, real original. Well I am sure you
all will probably want to edit this doc file to change it to the WCA Game 
Solve for Leisure Suit Larry 3, well just to set the record straight...

   Leisure Suit Larry 3 came out in the stores Friday Nov. 3rd, 1989. We had 
it on our boards not 30 minutes after it came out. We also had it sent to 
approximately 20 boards during the weekend. Since there are only 3 of us, and 
at this time none of us have USR HST's, well it kinda takes awhile to send 2.4 
megs to EACH AND EVERY BBS... Now, FiRM supposidly has a crack on this, I 
havent seen it, YET, but knowing FiRM's rep, I am sure that they didnt steal 
our files. However, this game solve can be used with the FiRM release...

    Also to set the record straight on some other Sierra stuff, Codename 
ICEMAN is not out yet, and it will not be out until December, we got this 
straight from Sierra itself, so for those people who are saying "I saw it, 
honest dude!"... Well, prove that it exists..

    I would also like to take this time and say thank you to Nightmare for 
showing us what a complete idiot you are. Of course we are a NEW GROUP, and 
are not that established, but we are here to stay, and with time, hopefully, 
we will be as big (or close to it) as some of these other organizations...
Its just right now we dont have the members for this. If you have to be such 
an immature idiot as to not give a starting group a chance, you should be 
shot.

    As far as GPA goes, we are VERY VERY SMALL, but always looking for 
members. If you wish to be a member of GPA, contact either myself (timelord), 
or Low Rider at one of the two GPA boards:

The Tardis GPA Hq [9O4]376-1117          BadLands [9O4]336-6608

And even if you dont want to be a member of GPA, you should call our boards 
anyways, since we have alot to offer...

Now, on to the history of Larry 3...

The Larry series, as most of you probably know, is unlike most games. It's 
more of a "Pornographic Sex Adventure" where you are the bumbling Larry 
Laffer, on his never ending quest for pussy. This one is quite unique however 
since you are TWO characters, Larry, and Passionate Patti (Larry's beloved?)..
About halfway through the game you will switch into Patti.... I wont go into 
that now.. There is one part to note, there will be a set of commands called 
"LEI COMMANDS", they are shortened and are the following set of instructions:
Go to cave by Chip-n-Dales
Enter cave
Save game
go to edge of cliff
get flowers
make lei
exit cave
go back to whatever you were doing before..Since we had to finish this game 
with these commands like 5 times due to flowers wilting, well...

Also, you can beat the 4000 point score, we finished it with 4337 today 
(Tuesday, Nov. 7th). Well, now I am going to let someone take over here to get 
started on the typing here...

Hint:
Click the Eye icon on the coffee pot just outside the door, then

Problem:
What do I do in the video tape room?

Hint:
Get three videotapes lying on the  table just to the left of the

the Hand icon on the drawer in the top-left corner. Make sure to
degauss the tapes.

used in your camera. To do this, click each tape, one at a time,
by using  the degausser on the  table along the top  wall in the
video tape room.

Problem:
How do I charge my video camera?

Hint:

beside the coffee  maker in the lobby. Plug  the battery charger
in by clicking  on any available outlet. Select  the camera from
inventory  and click  it on  the battery  charger. Click the Eye
icon  on the  camera to  verify the  camera is  charged to  one-

camera  to  unplug  it  and  retrieve  both  the  camera and the
charger.

Problem:

What do I do in the file room?

Hint:
You'll find resumes  of the finalists in the  first file cabinet

which is sitting  in the imprinter on the  table by clicking the
Hand icon on it.

Problem:
How do I know when I am ready to leave PornProdCorp?

Hint:
If  you have  a camera  from the  meeting room,  three degaussed
video tapes, a battery charger,  three resumes, and the Aerodork
Gold Card, you  are ready to go. A limo  will be waiting for you
outside. Just click the Hand icon on the limo's door to open it.

through an animated sequence.

Problem:
Can I do anything in the limo?

only when you leave the Hard Disk Cafe in New York.

Problem:
I'm in a new city. How do I tell the driver where to go?

take you to the address on the item if the item matches the city
you're currently in.

Problem:
My  limo just  arrived at   the curb  outside the  airport, where
should I go?

Hint:
You can go two places; inside  the airport, and to the Automatic
Ticket Machine (ATM) to the left of the airport door.

Problem:
How do I operate the Automatic Ticket Machine (ATM)?

Hint:
Click the  Hand icon on the  ATM to get a  close-up view. Select
the AeroDork Gold  Card from your inventory and  click it on the
slot  to  the  left  of  the  ATM  screen. When the destinations
appear, click  the Hand icon on  whichever destination you want.
You may travel  to any city in any order  you wish. Punch in the
proper code  from the AeroDork  Travel Folder that  came in your
game box. When the Boarding Pass emerges, click the Hand icon on
it to  take it, then on  the AeroDork Gold Card  to take it from
the slot.

Problem:
I can't find a gate or a plane!

Hint:
Select your  AeroDork Gold Card  from inventory and  click it on
the camera right outside the VIP lounge door.

Problem:
How do I board the plane?

Hint:
Just make sure  you have your boarding pass and  that you are in
the VIP lounge.  You get the boarding pass  from the ATM machine
outside the airport. Once you're in  the VIP lounge and the "now
boarding" sign flashes, select your boarding pass from inventory
and click it on the slot to the right of the door.

Problem:
What can I do on board the plane?

Hint:
Take the magazine from the seat pocket in front of you. Read it.

Problem:
My plane has just landed at a new airport, what do I do?

Hint:
You need to leave the airport by limo. Click the Eye icon on the
large  display ads  at the  top of  the airport terminal screens
until you find the limo company's  number. You will need to call
them.

Problem:
I can't find a working phone!

Hint:
Each airport (except the very first  one) will have at least one
working phone. Try them all until you find one that works.

Problem:
I've completed all three interviews where do I go now?

Hint:
It's time to go back to  PornProdCorp. When you're done with New
York, Atlantic City, and Miami, go back to the airport and get a
ticket to Los Angeles.

Problem:
Help! My plane is going to crash! What can I do to help?

Hint:
When the  stewardess calls for  volunteers, you'll automatically
be led to  the cockpit. Start clicking the  Hand icon on various
dials and controls. Sooner or later, you'll find one that may do
some good.

Problem:
What do I do in the airport?

Hint:
You need to do two things;  make sure your camera is charged up,
and call the limo company. First use the Eye icon on your camera
to make sure it's charged up. If the camera's batteries are low,
you can  charge them up  here. Select your  battery charger from
inventory then  click it on the  outlet on the far  west wall of
the terminal. Next, select your  camera from inventory and click
it on the plugged-in battery charger.  Click the Eye icon on the
camera to  verify the camera  is charged to  one-hundred-percent
power. Find  the number for the  limo company and use  a working
phone on the east side of the terminal.

Problem:
Where can I find change for the phone?

Hint:
You can  get change for the  phone by clicking the  Hand icon on
the Jerry's Kids' Collection  Canister underneath the VIP lounge
verification camera.

Problem:
How can I tell the limo driver where to take me?  What do I do in
the limo?

Hint:
Select the napkin  from your inventory and click  it on the limo
driver.  You can  find the  napkin by  clicking the  Eye icon on
Michelle's resume.  When you get  the day trotter  date book, be
sure  to  open  it  by  clicking  the  Hand  icon  on it in your
inventory.

Problem:
I made it to the Hard Disk Cafe, but can't get past the Matre D'!

Hint:
Continue to talk  to the Maitre D' by clicking  the Talk icon on
him.  Eventually  he'll  give  in  and  punch  you  up  your own
membership tape.

Problem:
How  can I  follow Michelle  into the  exclusive Herman Hollerith
room?

Hint:
Remember the brochure you read on the airplane? You need to find
the  music box  in the  lobby. Select  your membership tape from
inventory and click it on the music box. Now when you click your
membership tape  on the computer  you'll be able  to go anywhere
you want.

Problem:
Michelle is sitting just a few feet away from me, what do I do?

Hint:
Click the  Talk icon on Michelle  a few times. When  she invites

Problem:
What's the basic idea behind this game? How do I play?

Hint:
Help all  the babes in the  game. Find a babe.  Talk to her. Find  out what she
needs,  get it  for her,  and get   ready for  some gratitude.  Not! Don't  get
frustrated. Helping  one babe may allow  you to eventually find  the right babe
for you.

Problem:
How do I get started?

Hint:
If you're in the  front lobby at the beginning of the  game, try talking to the
front desk clerk  to get your room key.  Go up the stairs to  your room, unlock
your door and go  inside. Look at the table. Try calling  all the phone numbers
on the cards on the table. Go to  the bathroom. Use the sink. Look at the brown
water. Call maintenance to send a plumber up to fix it.

Problem:
How do I use the elevator or the ice machine next to my room?

Hint:
Some things are  not useful at the beginning  of the game such as  the elevator
and  ice machine.  We're going  to try  hard to  make you  forget about certain
things that you see early on, so keep  your eyes peeled and remember to look at
things later that you couldn't use at the start!

Problem:                            
What does Gammie want?

Hint:
Gammie wants to use the Cellulite Machine. You'll have to fix it.

Problem:
How do I repair the Cellulite machine's piston?

Hint:
Go to the dining  room. Walk into the kitchen. Put your  hand in the garbage to
find a can of  lard. Take the lard and use it to  lubricate the large piston on
the left.

Problem:
How do I repair the Cellulite machine's ripped vacuum hose?

Hint:
Go to the Mud  Bath and walk one screen to the right  to reach the Weight Room.
There is a wide rubber belt on  the BunShaker machine. If the BunShaker machine
is  being used,  talk to  the  body-builder,  Thunderbird. Leave  the room  and
return. The BunShaker should be vacant and  you can take the belt. Use the belt
on the hole in the vacuum hose of the Cellulite Machine.

Problem:
How do I clean the Cellulite machine's filter?

Hint:
Use a  wrench on the  filter tank bolt.  Open the filter  lid. Take the clogged
filter and use it  on the sink in the Kitchen to clean  it. Put the filter back
in the filter tank. Close the lid and tighten the bolt with the wrench.

Problem:
Where can I find a wrench?

Hint:
You can get a wrench from the plumber. Go to your bathroom and run the water in
the sink.  If you see brown  water, call maintenance at  extension 76 to report
your plumbing  problems. If the  water is clear,  stuff a roll  of toilet paper
down the  toilet. You can  get some toilet  paper from the  front of the maid's
cart  that appears  every now  and  then  outside your  room. When  the plumber
arrives, click the pick-up icon next to  the plumber to get the wrench. Use the
pick-up icon, not the hand icon. Take his file too, you might need it.

Problem:
I think the machine works, but I can't seem to tell Gammie.  Why?

Hint:
Give the machine a  test run. Turn it on. Wait for  the message that everything
is okay. Once you see the message, shut the machine down and go talk to Gammie.

Problem:
Where can I get an orange?

Hint:
Go to the Dining Room. Click your hand on the salad bar to find an orange. Take
the orange.

Problem:
I need something to cool Gammie's forehead. What can I do?

Hint:
Get a washcloth  from the front of the  maid's cart that appears every  now and
then outside  your room. Click  the washcloth on  the pool. Go  to the Kitchen.
Open the refrigerator door. Put the wet cloth inside and close the fridge door.
Leave the Kitchen. Return to the Kitchen and open the fridge. Use the take icon
to pick up the cool cloth.

Problem:
Where can I get some mineral water?

Hint:
If Gammie asks for some mineral water, go to the hallway door east of the Blues
Bar to find a room service tray. Take the mineral water off the tray.

Problem:
After I helped Gammie, she took off!  Why did I go through all this?

Hint:
Gammie left  behind a lot  of excess cellulite.  This can be  useful. Go to the
beach and click your hand on the sand  to find a whale oil lamp. Click the lamp
on the  drainage faucet in  the center  of  the Cellulite Drainage  room. Get a
match in the Blues Bar and click your zipper on it to light it. Light the lamp,

Health Spa. Rose is in the High  Colonic Treatment room through the door on the

can take are in  your room. If you don't have your room  key, talk to the front
desk girl to get  it. Get the flowers from the vase in  your room and give them
to Rose. She'll give you an orchid for all your troubles.

on the curtain to  walk on stage. Walk south of the  stage between the curtains
to find the dress. Take the dress and give it to Shablee.

Problem:
Shablee says she'll meet me later on the beach, but later never happens!

Hint:
You need to get a condom. Get your room key from the girl at the front desk and
go upstairs to  your room. Look at the  cards on the table. Call  the Turn Down
service at 75 to order a surprise.  Leave your room and go downstairs. When you
return to your  room, a condom will be  left on your bed. Take  the condom, and
you'll meet Shablee on the beach.

Problem:
I've met Shablee on the beach. What do I do now?

Hint:
Put your hand on  her and talk to her several times.  When the moment is right,
click the  condom on her.  When you've returned  to your room,  go back to  the
beach and get the champagne.

stops  outside the  employee's campground.  Give the  match to  Art so he'll go
smoke a cigar. After  Art leaves, click your hand on the  tram to open the rear
hood. Use  the wrench on  the tram motor  to disconnect some  cables. After you
close the  hood, Art returns  and will open  the hood. Talk  to Art to  get his
flashlight. Before  Art asks you to  return his flashlight, click  your hand on
the flashlight to remove the batteries.

Problem:
Where can I get a wrench?

Hint:
You can get a wrench from the plumber. Go to your bathroom and run the water in
the sink.  If you see brown  water, call maintenance at  extension 76 to report
your plumbing  problems. If the  water is clear,  stuff a roll  of toilet paper
down the  toilet. You can  get some toilet  paper from the  front of the maid's
cart  that appears  every now  and  then  outside your  room. When  the plumber
arrives, click the pick-up icon next to  the plumber to get the wrench. Use the
pick-up icon, not the hand icon. Take his file too, you might need it.

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 1

 Okay, you guys, like, it's time to rescue Dave's adorable cheerleader
girlfriend, Sandy, from the clutches of Dr. Fred! Sandy has been kidnapped by
Dr. Fred for her brain -- not her beauty! Dave needs an adventure party of two,
each with their own weaknesses and strengths. For this outing, we'll use Razor
and Bernard; however, the walkthru will cover solutions involving other
characters. Now, get going to MANIAC MANSION, you tuna heads!

 Dave leads the way. Move him west until he comes to the front door of the
mansion. Lousy architecture, isn't it? Tasteless, but sinister. He goes up the
front steps, where he can PICK UP MAT, then PICK UP KEY. Now switch to Razor and
Bernard and let them join Dave. Have Dave UNLOCK FRONT DOOR WITH KEY, GIVE KEY
TO RAZOR, and enter the Mansion. Take Bernard and Dave into the foyer. Note that
each room has about three views or angles; you may have to scroll in order to
see everything. You initiate scrolling by clicking the cursor on the bottom
corners of the screen.

 Hm, the door to the right of the center stairs has no knob! Dave has seen a lot
of "B" movies, so he goes to the gargoyle on the right and tries to PUSH
GARGOYLE. Creak! The door opens! Golly, gee, this ain't your average split
level. Switch to Bernard, and dare him to go first. Bernard bravely inches
through the door into the darkness beyond. Gee whillikers, this is the first of
many dark rooms. A light can be found in all but one. In order to turn it on,
click WHAT IS then move the cursor around the screen. Once you find the light,
enter the keyboard command TURN ON and press <Return>. The light goes on, and
Bernard finds himself in a basement with a furnace and nuclear reactor --
standard equipment for maniacs. He walks west to the fuse box, skirting the
puddle of radioactive slime (it's a red herring, anyway), in order to PICK UP
SMALL, SILVER KEY. Note the door to his left because it leads to a very
important region. Go back to Dave, who says, "That's nice, Bernard, I think I'll
go join Razor outside." Switch to Dave in order to get him outside the front
door.

 NOTE: You have to move the characters out of the halls at certain points
because Dr. Fred's toothsome wife, Nurse Edna, and their repulsive son, Weird
Ed, have a habit of roaming around in real time. Anyone they find, they throw in
the dungeon. Should this happen to one of your characters, two ways out are
available, one of which will be revealed shortly.

 Well, switch back to Bernard, who is on his own now, so OPEN DOOR to the east
and WALK TO DOOR to a living room with a large, crystal chandelier. OPEN OLD
FASHIONED RADIO, as Bernard is really into stuff like that. PICK UP RADIO TUBE;
spare parts might come in handy. OPEN CABINET DOOR and note the cassette player.
If you examine the chandelier carefully, you'll see a white key on the right
side. None of the characters will climb the couch; you'll have to get it down
some other way. Patience! Bernard continues east through the double doors, then
lights the Library. The circular staircase is interesting but a red herring, as
is Chuck the Plant. The phone is broken, and perhaps Bernard will find tools
later. He notices a loose panel just above the phone and can OPEN LOOSE PANEL
then PICK UP a blank CASSETTE TAPE. He returns to the foyer.

 Now is a good time to save your game. Depending on your timing, Edna might be
found snacking in the kitchen. If so, she'll throw Bernard in the dungeon.
Should that happen, he can get out by using the key from the chandelier;
however, he hasn't got it yet. The other solution requires that two characters
work together, so someone else will have to get caught at the first opportunity.
Under the left barred window in the dungeon is a loose brick. If one character
PUSHes LOOSE BRICK, the other can escape out the door to the east. It's not so
terrible getting caught, because you get some important information: 1) The
dungeon door is the same one by the fuse box, and 2) the outer door to the
"Sekrit" lab, where Sandy is being held, is in the dungeon, even though it's
heavily padlocked and secured with an electronic keypad. Do not leave anyone in
the dungeon with key objects. (I once left Dave there for the entire game, only
to let the others out. So much for his heroism!)

 Bernard opens the door next to the grandfather clock. He finds himself in a
modernized kitchen. PICK UP flashlight from the counter. What's that on the
wall? Ick! Dull knives and a chainsaw. The knives are stuck to the wall with a
suspicious, gummy substance. The chainsaw has no fuel -- at least not in this
game -- so forget it. Continue to walk Bernard east and hope that Edna is not
grazing. She's not there? Good! He can OPEN REFRIGERATOR and PICK UP CAN OF
PEPSI. There's a lot of other dubious stuff in here, which Bernard leaves
strictly alone. Moving east again, he enters yet another room and not a moment
too soon as, about now, Ed will come down to pick up the cheese for his hamster.
If Bernard is in the kitchen, it's the slammer again for him. Ed has no humor
about cheese.

 The banquet hall looks fit for Banquo's ghost, so he walks east again. Bernard
enters the pantry in order to PICK UP BOTTLE OF DEVELOPER. Oops, what a klutz!
The bottle topples, smashes on the floor, and the developer seeps through a
grate. Hm, wonder where it went? Oh, well, Bernard can PICK UP FRUIT DRINKS and
GLASS JAR. Then, he should UNLOCK DOOR WITH SILVER KEY and go out to the pool.
It, at least, looks well-maintained, though the water has a strange glow. USE
GLASS JAR WITH SWIMMING POOL. Never know when Bernard might need some water. A
nice radio floats in the pool, but he doesn't like the water -- none of the
characters do, including the surfer dude. Time for Bernard to OPEN GATE and go
east to the garage. The doors are firmly shut and very heavy. Wow, what a wimp!
He can't even budge them!

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 2

 Fingering the little knobs Bernard laughingly calls his biceps, Bernard returns
to the foyer and heads up the center stairs. His footsteps sound unnaturally
loud, but no one stops him. At the head of the stairs is a door, which, in the
IBM version, is a steel security door with keypad. In other versions, where the
diskettes themselves are copy protected, he can go straight through. In any
case, he shouldn't go through now as he has stuff to do. Walk him west into the
artist's studio in order to PICK UP BOWL OF WAX FRUIT, PAINTBRUSH, and PAINT
REMOVER. Then, he goes east to the music room. That's a nice TV and even nicer
cassette recorder! The Victrola looks old, but serviceable.

 Now, he may return to the hallway and go through the center door either by
walking straight through or by using the sheet in the docs to USE KEYPAD. The
coded numbers can be located in those columns of the red and gray sheet. Once
through the door, Bernard finds himself in a blue hallway surrounded by tasteful
art. He opens the first door to the east, and turns on the light: It's a medical
examining room. Feeling nervous, Bernard OPENs DESK, and PICKs UP MANUSCRIPT,
which is the memoir of a meteor, ill-written though and not his sort of thing at
all. If Jill picks it up, she must deal with its ungrammatical structure; it is
her puzzle and vital to winning the game. Exactly how she deals with it will be
revealed later. For now, Bernard exits this room and enters the next door to the
east, where he finds a great game room with standalone video games. Too bad
there isn't any power, and, anyway, he has no change in his pocket. He spent all
his money on more memory for his computer last week. Sighing over what might
have been, he exits and goes up the stairs to the east.

 On the next floor, he walks west, and a Green Tentacle hops toward him. Bernard
screams hysterically and runs away! You see, Bernard has one little weakness:
He's terrified of giant, hopping tentacles. Fortunately, it doesn't come up very
often. So temporarily retire Bernard, preferably inside another room and switch
to Razor, who should stop off in the music room to watch TV. Great, an ad from
Three Guys Who Publish Anything. Maybe they'd accept a demo if she had one! If
she feels the urge, she can also play the baby grand. Razor is interchangeable
with Syd, who is also musically talented. Once she arrives at Bernard's
location, switch to him, and GIVE FRUIT DRINKS, WAX FRUIT, and CASSETTE TAPE TO
RAZOR.

 Razor continues up the stairs. That cute Tentacle is just hungry for its
favorite munchies. No, silly, not people, just GIVE WAX FRUIT TO TENTACLE. Then,
GIVE FRUIT DRINKS TO GREEN TENTACLE. He lets her past, where she continues up
the stairs. She passes a door that is the photo lab, only important to Michael.
What horrors await on the next floor?

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 3

 Walk softly on the third floor because the family's bedrooms are here. If Razor
enters Edna's or Ed's, you know where they'll put her! However, she can OPEN the
very first DOOR, since it's just the radio room. Hm, looks more like Bernard's
kind of place. Rock stars are always hungry, so PICK UP DIME -- it's that little
speck on the floor -- then scroll the room, and go up the ladder. Razor is blown
away by the Green Tentacle's bedroom, where he'll tell you his secret sorrow:
He, too, is an aspiring rock star who can't get his band to gel. It seems they
keep disappearing into the basement, so GT is in a major depression. Razor
admires his mondo stereo, humongous speakers, and PICKs UP RECORD. Then, scroll
the room and she can PICK UP YELLOW KEY hanging on the wall near GT's corner of
gloom. Go back through the radio room, where she learns from the wanted poster
that a murderous purple meteor is on the loose. She puts two and two together,
and they add up to radioactive slime!

 About now the doorbell will ring. If you have any characters in the halls,
better get them out because Ed will go downstairs to pick up a package. He deals
with some strange mail order houses. Switch to Dave quickly and beat Ed to it;
go west to the mailbox, and PICK UP PACKAGE. Ed comes outside but doesn't bother
Dave. This is the last time one of the family goes roving. From now on, you can
solve the game without that kind of interference.

 Dave cannot help but OPEN PACKAGE. Some stamps fall off, though the package
doesn't yield. If you're playing with Michael, you will probably need to deliver
the package to Ed. In order to do so, a character can take it to his room or
ring the doorbell. At this point in the game, undeveloped film has appeared in
the bushes to the right of the front steps. Michael can develop it into commando
plans, which Ed will use to rescue the kids from the Meteor at the end of the
game. The package has another use: Until it is delivered, Ed can be extracted
from his room by ringing the doorbell. This allows another character to get in
there and search!

 Switch back to Razor and find Bernard, then GIVE YELLOW KEY TO BERNARD. A cut
scene pours on the pressure, as you see that Dr. Fred is about to connect Sandy
to the brain sucking machine -- if the Purple Tentacle (another one!) doesn't
mess with her first. Must be her fetching little halter top. Razor goes to the
music room. Have her USE RECORD WITH VICTROLA, then TURN ON VICTROLA. Some
high-pitched tentacle cries rend the air and shatter Nurse Edna's favorite
antique vase. That gives Razor an idea: TURN OFF VICTROLA, then USE CASSETTE
TAPE IN CASSETTE RECORDER. TURN ON RECORDER, then TURN ON VICTROLA. Now, she
should turn everything off and PICK UP CASSETTE TAPE.

 Razor must go downstairs to the living room and USE CASSETTE TAPE IN CASSETTE
PLAYER. When she TURNs ON CASSETTE PLAYER, the din shatters the windows, and,
just as she hoped, the chandelier as well! Now Razor can PICK UP OLD RUSTY KEY
from the broken glass. Now she has a key to the door between the dungeon and the
basement. If anyone gets caught, just send Razor down with the key! Razor must
now TURN OFF PLAYER and PICK UP TAPE. Then walk her back to the music room, and,
this time, Razor makes a recording of her tune on the piano. She collects the
tape and goes to the Green Tentacle's bedroom. When she USEs THE CASSETTE TAPE
IN the PLAYER, GT is so impressed that he recruits her for his band. The new
possibilities snap GT out of his depression. He gives her his treasured DEMO
TAPE. Too bad she doesn't have stamps and an envelope -- she could do GT a real
favor by sending the demo to the Three Guys. She goes to the hall and thinks it
over.

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 4

 Switch to Bernard, who should go to the third floor. Then he can enter the
fourth door to the east, which has some very strange gimmicks in it. Don't miss
any of them! Bernard sees the answer to a prayer when he has the chance to USE
HUNK-O-MATIC (tm) twice!! That puny body just ripples with newfound strength.
Any of the characters can use it and perform the two tasks it makes possible.
Now scroll the room and walk Bernard through the door to the east. He finds
himself in a bathroom that shows what a lousy housekeeper Edna is: For one
thing, she left Dead Cousin Ted in the shower. Something is written behind him,
but the dummy, er, mummy won't move over. Make sure to have your character PICK
UP SPONGE to the left of the sink, especially if playing with Michael.

 Bernard goes back to the hallway and through the door at the east end of the
hall. It's a family room with portrait, typewriter, and Man-eating Plant, just
what every family has! An unsightly paint blotch is on the wall. Have Bernard
USE PAINT REMOVER WITH PAINT BLOTCH and a door appears. He OPENs it. Since it
looks dark and there's NO light, he decides to let it wait until later. Now send
Bernard outside the house (trudge, trudge, trudge), and on the way, switch to
Razor so that Bernard can get the YELLOW KEY and DIME.

 Outside Bernard should go to the left of the front steps, and OPEN BUSHES.
Inside he finds a grate, which, with his new muscles, he easily opens. He climbs
through the grate and follows the pipes to the east. Along the way, he sees the
puddle of developer. USE SPONGE WITH DEVELOPER, and, presto, he's got it! Only
Michael can use it, along with water from the pool, to develop the film in the
photo lab. If Michael then gives those to Ed, Ed will charge in to remove the
Meteor at the end of the game.

 Bernard comes to a water valve. "Hey, Dave," Bernard shouts, "I've found a way
to empty the pool. Get over there!" Guys with muscles give orders, so switch to
Dave and walk him to the pool ladder. Then, switch to Bernard and TURN ON VALVE.
Bernard now hears a terrible whooshing sound, so switch to Dave and move him
down the ladder into the empty pool. At this point, a cut scene will inform you
that Dr. Fred has been using the pool to chill out his nuclear reactor and now
fears a meltdown. He sends Purple Tentacle to check; if anyone is in the
basement, they will get thrown in the cell. Ignore this, and quickly have Dave
PICK UP RADIO and GLOWING KEY. If Dave pushes the tempting red button, he will
start a meltdown, so just move Dave back up the ladder. If he is still in the
pool when you switch to Bernard and TURN OFF VALVE, then Dave will drown. Sandy
would be most unhappy, so do all that and the water refills the pool instantly.
Bernard can now join Dave by the pool, where Dave gives him the YELLOW KEY, the
STAMPS, and the RADIO. Bernard has the know-how necessary to OPEN RADIO. Hurrah,
batteries for the flashlight. Right away, Bernard should take this opportunity
to USE BATTERIES WITH FLASHLIGHT. I'll bet Bernard can explore that dark room
now!

 Before he does, however, he walks over to the garage and easily opens the
garage door. Lo! and behold: It's Weird Ed's Edsel! What vintage wheels! What
fins! A little exploration reveals that Ed has been modifying it with a rocket
engine (left fin). Store away that little tidbit of information. The shelf on
the left contains a WATER FAUCET HANDLE which Bernard should PICK UP. The cement
slab is a red herring and useless. Now let Bernard OPEN TRUNK WITH YELLOW KEY,
and, finally, Bernard has TOOLS to PICK UP. With that in mind, he goes back to
the library to FIX PHONE WITH TOOLS. Switch to Dave and leave him in the library
contemplating calling a chat line. Now save your game again.

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 5

 The next bit of timing can be tricky, as someone needs to search Weird Ed's
bedroom (the third door to the right on the upper floor). Take Bernard right up
to the door. Now you have a choice. Assuming you have NOT delivered the package,
you can have Dave ring the doorbell while Bernard nips in the room. Or, if you
prefer, Razor (remember her?) can go in the room, and, while Ed is throwing her
in the clink, Bernard can search. In any case, before this sequence, Razor must
GIVE DIME TO BERNARD. Once in the room, he should move quickly to PICK UP
HAMSTER, and PICK UP CARD KEY that is under it. Move briskly to the piggy bank,
then OPEN PIGGY BANK. As it cracks open, Bernard realizes he's applied too much
pressure. PICK UP DIME and get him out of there fast! He should enter the weight
room again or Ed might get him! Whew, hacking was never such sweaty work!

 Save your game at this point, because Bernard is about to enter the room to the
east of the family room. Before Bernard does this, position Razor (if she's down
there) or Dave at the fuse box and OPEN FUSE BOX. Now, Bernard should TURN ON
FLASHLIGHT, and go through the hatch door in the paint blotch. As he plays the
flashlight around the room, he sees broken wires on the back wall to the left.
No wonder the arcade games won't play. Switch to the character by the fuse box
and TURN OFF CIRCUIT BREAKER. This is tricky again, because Bernard must FIX
WIRES WITH TOOLS before Dr. Fred sends the Purple Tentacle to turn on the power
again. And, of course, the character who is in the basement may wind up in the
dungeon. If you have time, TURN ON CIRCUIT BREAKER, and get Razor or whoever out
of there!

 At some point after this, Dr. Fred will play the arcade games. Note that he is
playing Meteor Mess. Maybe one of your characters would like to play, too? Too
bad no one has a quarter; the games won't accept the dimes. Switch back to
Bernard, since he's so handy, and send him into the bathroom to FIX WATER FAUCET
WITH HANDLE. Turn the shower on and off. Eek! Dead Cousin Ted moves over to
reveal the following message: "For a good time, call Edna ____." The phone
number varies according to the combination of characters. For Razor and Bernard,
it is 5235. Let's play a trick on Edna, who has appeared most unsympathetic in
several cut scenes.

 Save your game because she may get Bernard -- she's skinny but fast! Position
Bernard just outside her door (the second door to the east or right on the upper
floor). Dave must USE PHONE, and click in the number Bernard saw in the
bathroom. Get Bernard into her door right after the phone rings. Seems Edna has
a little phone habit; so as she demonstrates how to make an obscene phone call,
Bernard can PICK UP SMALL KEY from Edna's nightstand, and go up the ladder in
the eastern corner of the room. If he has time (or doesn't mind getting caught),
he can check out what's over her bed!

 Once more Bernard is in the dark, so TURN ON LIGHT to look around Edna's attic.
OPEN PAINTING and note the wall safe. Underneath is scrawled a number too tiny
to read. Have Dave call Edna again, walk Bernard to the hall, and into the radio
room for a minute. Be sure to shut Edna's door, or she may nab him.

 The coast is clear, so send Bernard back to the family room and save your game.
Have Bernard USE JAR OF WATER WITH MANEATING PLANT and watch it grow. Then he
can USE CAN OF PEPSI WITH MANEATING PLANT and watch it burp. Disgusting. (NOTE:
In some versions, it appears to grow twice. Early Apple versions contained a bug
that sometimes required reverse syntax, i.e., USE MANEATING PLANT WITH JAR OF
WATER. Your saved game will allow you to experiment.) Walk Bernard straight
toward the plant. It's satisfied, so it won't bite him and he climbs up to the
hatch above its head, and winds up in the observatory with an immense telescope.
Save your game here, too.

 Bernard is curious about the equipment, so he decides to USE DIME IN COIN SLOT,
then PUSH RIGHT BUTTON. He should repeat this with the second dime. Then he can
USE TELESCOPE and see the combination to Edna's safe, which, again is variable
according to which characters are being used. For Bernard and Razor, it is 1230.

 Save your game again, or you could be sorry! Bernard sneaks back to Edna's
door. Dave calls her on the phone, while Bernard whips up to the attic. He
should USE WALL SAFE and PICK UP SEALED ENVELOPE. Do NOT open it, because it'll
tear and cannot be repaired. Repeat the process you used before to get back to
the hall, saving your game beforehand. Bernard is doing well; so send him out to
the pool to fill up that jar again. Also, get the other two characters back to
the foyer for convenience's sake. Around this time, Dr. Fred says he is going to
shut off the power for five minutes. If you haven't repaired the arcade wires,
or you found it too troublesome, Bernard can easily make the repairs by himself
once the power is off. Wait for the rooms to go dark.

 MANIAC MANSION
     Part 6

 If you have time, move Bernard to the kitchen. OPEN MICROWAVE OVEN. USE
ENVELOPE WITH MICROWAVE OVEN. USE JAR OF WATER WITH MICROWAVE OVEN. CLOSE
MICROWAVE OVEN and TURN ON MICROWAVE OVEN. After a suitable interlude, TURN OFF
MICROWAVE OVEN. Now be patient, for if he opens it too soon, a cloud of
microwave steam will envelop him and his tombstone will be a small, tasteful one
out on the front lawn. Bernard's part is almost done, so he can GIVE CARD KEY
and SMALL KEY TO DAVE and GIVE STAMPS TO RAZOR. Then, send him up to the radio
room, where he can READ WANTED POSTER. It includes a number for the Meteor
Police (in this game, 3412). First Bernard must fix the radio, so USE RADIO TUBE
IN TUBE SOCKET. (Aren't you glad he carried it around for practically the whole
game?)

 Switch to Razor and OPEN MICROWAVE OVEN. Now she can PICK UP ENVELOPE and USE
STAMPS ON ENVELOPE. The envelope now opens without tearing and a quarter falls
out. She has other things on her mind than video games, so she can GIVE QUARTER
TO DAVE. Now, she goes up to the family room and USEs ENVELOPE WITH TYPEWRITER.
If the character has seen TV, she/he types the address of Three Guys Who Publish
Anything. Will she promote herself? She will NOT! She must be magnanimous and
USE DEMO TAPE WITH ENVELOPE, go outside to the mailbox west of the house, and
OPEN MAILBOX. Then she can USE TAPE IN MAILBOX and PULL FLAG. Now she can go
back to the front door and wait.

 It's now Dave's turn, and is he ever burning for action! Does he go get Sandy?
No way! He heads straight to the arcade room and stands in front of Meteor Mess.
USE QUARTER IN SLOT. If Dr. Fred has played, it is important to record his high
score: At long last he has the combination to the inner door of the Sekrit Lab,
which, in this game, is 5858. If Dr. Fred has not played, Dave must wait until
he sees him do so. No problem, though; he can USE SMALL KEY WITH COIN BOX and
PICK UP QUARTER. Play as many times as he wants or needs to!

 At some point, you will see the Three Guys discover the Green Tentacle's genius
and send him a recording contract. When the doorbell rings, Razor can PICK UP
CONTRACT, and either give it to Dave or deliver it herself. Whichever character
delivers it, the Green Tentacle vows to always protect that person later on.
This promise will not hold for the other characters. This contract is a major
point of variation among scenarios tied to the character combinations. Syd can
follow the same route as Razor. Jill must USE MANUSCRIPT IN TYPEWRITER. However,
this scenario has a different outcome. The contract is prepared for the Meteor.
If it is delivered to the Green Tentacle, he kills her for being on the Meteor's
side. However, the contract can be used in just a minute! So be patient, you're
almost done!

 While Razor is waiting for the postman, it is a good idea for Bernard to TURN
ON RADIO, and USE RADIO to call the Meteor Police. They declare they will arrive
in five minutes and that the inner lab door must be unlocked. It is also useful
for Razor to GIVE RUSTY KEY TO DAVE. Have Razor PUSH GARGOYLE so that Dave can
go down to the basement and UNLOCK DUNGEON DOOR WITH RUSTY KEY. Once inside the
dungeon, he can UNLOCK UPPER PADLOCK WITH GLOWING KEY, and repeat that process
with the LOWER one. If playing with Michael, the film should be developed and
delivered to Weird Ed. If you have Bernard in the party, the police -- and they
are a strange bunch -- arrive and bear off the nefarious Meteor. If you have
Michael, Ed goes and gets him. However, if you have neither character, Dave can
take care of the Meteor, provided he has the YELLOW KEY before going into the
Sekrit lab.

 So, gather your courage for the closing scenario and let one character open the
inner door with the combination Dave got from Meteor Mess. If the police have
been there, check out the dungeon floor carefully, and let Dave PICK UP BADGE.
It's a bona fide piece of ID for the Meteor Police. Now he can go through that
door and meet his fate...and the sinister Dr. Fred! First, however, he must get
past the Purple Tentacle. If Dave is the character who helped GT, then he will
appear and tell PT to bug off. If Dave has the badge, then merely GIVE it to PT
and watch him turn into a quivering mass of tentacle flesh. If you are using
Jill, she can show him the contract for the Meteor, and PT will let her through
to talk to the big guy himself.

 This taken care of, go through the door to the east, where Dave sees the
nefarious Brain Sucking Machine, complete with Sandy in chains. Dr. Fred, who is
nearby, goes berserk and starts a countdown to nuclear destruction. Ignore
Sandy, go right to the locker, OPEN it, and USE RADIATION SUIT. USE CARD KEY in
the slot of the automatic door to the east. Once in the Meteor room, Dave must
PULL SWITCH, which detaches Dr. Fred from the evil influence. He halts the
countdown, and you win the game and Sandy, provided the Meteor is gone.
Otherwise, Dr. Fred appeals to Dave for help. Stifling his revulsion, Dave must
PICK UP PURPLE METEOR and open the door to the east of the Meteor Room.

 Dave's back in the garage, where he stuffs the Meteor in the trunk of the
Edsel, and can CLOSE TRUNK, then USE YELLOW KEY IN ROCKET ENGINE. This blasts
the Meteor into outer space and, maybe, a sequel. You've saved our brain trust,
until the aliens get their hands on the phone company in ZAK MCKRACKEN AND THE
ALIEN MINDBENDERS, anyway!

NOTES
(1)  There are FIVE possible ways to complete this adventure; this solution
works  with Dave, Syd and Bernard, and should provide insights into solving
the other variations.

(2)  In  all rooms you must open the door and in many you must also turn on
the light, neither of which is pointed out in this solution.

(3)  Don't use the flashlight or the batteries will run out (though you can
find  more!). To find a light switch in the dark, select "WHAT IS" and scan
the room by moving the cursor around.

(4)  There  are  TWO  ways  to  escape the dungeon. If two kids are trapped
there,  place  one  in  front of the door and have the other push the loose
brick  just  below  the  LEFT  window to momentarily open the dungeon door.
Quickly switch to the other kid, who will have just enough time to run out.
The other way is to use the rusty key.

                               THE SOLUTION

FRONT OF THE HOUSE
All three kids should be here. Pick up the door mat and get the key. Unlock
the front door and send all three inside. Send Bernard to the Library.

LIBRARY
Open  the  loose  panel directly below Chuck the Plant and get the cassette
tape. Switch to Dave and send him to the Kitchen.

KITCHEN
Edna catches Dave, which clears this route for the others. Dave can stay in
the  Dungeon  for now and should use the trick described in Note (4) to let
the others out when caught. Switch and send Syd into the Storage Room.

STORAGE ROOM
Have  Syd pick up the fruit drink and glass jar. Switch to Bernard and send
him to the Kitchen.

KITCHEN
Get  Bernard  to get the flashlight, then open the refrigerator and get the
Pepsi  can. Switch to Syd and send him to the Kitchen to give the glass jar
to Bernard. Sent them both to the Painting Room.

PAINTING ROOM
Syd should pick up the wax fruit and Bernard should get the paint remover.

THE TENTACLE IN THE ATTIC
Send  Syd  up the next set of stairs to the Top of the Stairs, just outside
the  Darkroom,  where he meets the Green Tentacle. Give the wax fruit, then
the fruit drink to the Tentacle and he'll let you pass.

THE RADIO ROOM
Switch to Bernard and send him here to get the dime. Then go left and climb
the  ladder to the Green Tentacle. Get the record on the shelf and find the
yellow  key  behind the Tentacle and get it. Then send Bernard to the Piano
Room.

WAS IT THE PIANO ROOM OR WAS IT MEMOREX?
Put  the  cassette  tape  in  the  cassette recorder. Put the record on the
victrola.  Turn  on  the cassette recorder and the victrola. Wait until the
glass  breaks,  then  turn  them both off. Have Bernard get the tape and go
into the Sitting Room.

THE SITTING ROOM
Bernard  should  open  the cabinet and put the tape in the cassette player.
Turn on the player and the chandelier will shatter. Turn off the player and
get  the  rusty  key that fell from the chandelier. (This unlocks the right
door  in the Dungeon). Open the old radio on top of the cassette player and
get the radio tube.

WEIGHTLIFTING AND THE HIDDEN GRATE
Send  Syd,  who may be in the Dungeon by now, to the Weightlifting Room and
have him use the Hunk-O-Matic Machine. Then send him outside the front door
and to the left of the stairs. Pick up the bushes to reveal the grate. Open
the grate, enter it and walk right to the water valve.

OFF TO THE POOL
Send  Bernard  to Edna's Room and she'll put him in the Dungeon. Unlock the
door  with  the rusty key. Have him get the silver key next to the fuse box
in  the  basement, then send him to the Storage Room. Get him to unlock the
Storage  Room with the silver key and go to the pool ladder. Fill the glass
jar with water from the pool.

UNDER THE HOUSE
Switch  to  Syd  and have him turn on the water valve. This drains the pool
and exposes the nuclear reactor's cooling rods, so you have to move fast (a
good place to SAVE your game!!).

IN THE POOL
When  the  "cut  scene"  is  over,  send Bernard down the ladder to get the
glowing  key and the radio. As soon as he's safely back on the cement, have
Syd turn off the water valve to refill the pool.

THE GARAGE
Send Syd and Bernard here and have Syd open the garage door. Bernard should
use the yellow key to open the trunk, then get the tools.

THE PLANT ROOM AND THE BROKEN WIRES
Send  Bernard  here  to  use  the paint remover on paint blotch to reveal a
door.  Open  the  door  and enter the Broken Wires Room. Turn on the light,
open  the  radio,  use batteries in flashlight, turn on flashlight, walk to
wires.

THE FUSE BOX
Send  Syd  in Edna's Room and she'll put him in the Dungeon. Have Dave push
the  loose  brick  to free Syd, then position Syd in front of the fuse box.
Open fuse box and turn off the circuit breakers.

BROKEN WIRES ROOM
When the "cut scene" ends, Bernard should fix the wires with the tools. Now
switch to Syd and turn on the circuit breakers. (The video machines are now
powered on).

EDNA AND THE WALL SAFE ROOM
Send  Syd and Bernard to the hall outside Edna's Room and have Bernard open
the  door and enter. While Edna takes him to the Dungeon, send Syd into her
room and go right to the ladder. Climb the ladder to the Safe Room. Turn on
light and open painting to reveal a wall safe.

THE MAN-EATING PLANT
Have  Bernard use the rusty key so he and Dave can escape the Dungeon. Send
Bernard  to  the  Plant  Room and use jar of water on the Man-eating Plant.
Give pepsi to Man-eating Plant. Climb up the plant to the Telescope Room.

TELESCOPE ROOM
Bernard  should  use  the  dime in the slot, then press the right button to
turn the telescope to the right.

WEIRD ED'S ROOM
Send  Dave  and  Bernard  to the doorway outside Ed's Room and have Bernard
give  the  rusty key and glowing key to Dave. Dave should open the door and
enter  Ed's.  When Ed takes Dave to the Dungeon, send Bernie into Ed's Room
where  he  must  walk  to the piggy bank, open the piggy bank, take another
dime, then go to the Telescope Room.

TELESCOPE ROOM
Bernard should use the dime in the slot, press the right button to turn the
telescope  to  the right, then use the telescope to read the combination of
the wall safe.

THE SAFE ROOM AND THE SECRET LAB
Switch  to  Syd  and  open  the wall safe with the combination that you now
know! Get the envelope, open it and get the quarter. Now send Syd back down
the  ladder,  where  Edna  will  catch him and lock him in the Dungeon with
Dave.  Switch to Dave, who should walk to the outer door and unlock the top
and bottom padlocks with the glowing key. Open the outer door to the Secret
Lab. Have Dave unlock the right Dungeon door with the rusty key.

ARCADE ROOM
Send  Syd  here  and play the Meteor Mess game with the quarter. Write down
the  high score.

WEIRD ED'S ROOM & THE HAMSTER
Send  Syd  and  Bernard to the doorway outside Ed's Room. Have Syd open the
door  and  enter.  When Ed takes him to the Dungeon, send in Bernard to get
the  hamster  and  reveal the purple card key. Get this and send Bernard to
the Radio Room. (He may get locked in the Dungeon first, however).

INTO THE SECRET LAB
Switch to Dave, who is here, and have him open the inner door to the Secret
Lab with the high score from the Meteor Mess game for the combination.

CALLING THE METEOR POLICE
Switch  to Bernard in the Radio Room and have him use the radio tube in the
tube radio. Read the poster, turn on radio, use radio to call Meteor Police
with  the  number from the poster. Now send Bernard to Edna's Room so he'll
get  put in the Dungeon. Then wait for the Meteor Police to arrive and take
out the Purple Meteor.

THE ZOM-B-MATIC ROOM AND THE METEOR ROOM
Switch to Bernard in the Dungeon, who should get the badge on the floor and
go  to the Secret Lab. Give the badge to the Purple Tentacle. After it runs
away, enter the Zom-B-Matic Room. Walk right and use the purple card key in
the key slot to enter the Meteor Room. Turn off switch!!

                            BEGINNING PLAY

        To begin play from your hard disk prompt (for example, C:>),
   type CD\MARTIAN to change to the Martian Dreams
   subdirectory. (If you selected a path name other than our default
   choice, change to the subdirectory to which you installed the
   game.)
        After selecting the game subdirectory, type
   MARTIAN< ENTER> to begin.

                             THE MAIN MENU

        After loading, an introductory sequence begins.  The
   introduction runs automatically, but you can press <ENTER> to
   skip quickly from one scene to the next.  Press <ESCAPE> if you
   wish to leave this sequence entirely.  Next, the main menu
   appears, listing four options: RUN INTRODUCTION, CREATE
   CHARALCTER, CONTINUE GAME and ABOUT MARTIAN DREAMS.
        To select one of these options, use the arrow keys or
   numeric keypad to higmight the option you want and then press
   <ENTER>.
        To exit the introduction, character creation or credits,
   press <ESCAPE>.
        These sequences will run automatically, but you can move
   from one screen to the next more quickly by pressing <SPACE>.

   [Run Introduction]

        RUN INTRODUCTION tells how you arrived on Mars. Information
   in this sequence is vital to your quest.

   [Create Character]

        CREATE CHARACTER must be selected the first time you play.
   When you are asked to name your character, a flashing cursor
   appears on screen.  Type your character's name (up to 12 letters
   long) and then press <ENTER>. If you do not type a name, the game
   assumes you are using the default (Avatar).  Go on to the next
   portion of the character creation system by pressing <SPACE>.
        During character creation, you are asked a series of
   questions.  Answer A or B to each question by typing in the
   appropriate letter.  The answers you provide determine the
   attributes and gender of the character you play.  For example, to
   play a male character, tell Dr. Freud that you identify with your
   father (A); to play a female, identify with your mother (B).


   [Continue Game]

        CONTINUE GAME lets you begin playing Martian Dreams.  In
   future sessions, this selection returns you to your last saved
   game.  You can also continue a saved game directly from DOS by
   typing GAME at the \MARTIAN prompt.

   [About Martian Dreams]

        ABOUT MARTIAN DREAMS lists all of the people who worked on
   the game.


                            USING THE MOUSE


        Martian Dreams allows you to use a mouse and/or keyboard
   during play.  All movement and icon selections can be handled
   using either of these devices. (For the exact uses of each device
   during game play, refer to the appropriate section(s) below.) If
   you use a mouse, bear in mind the following general rules:
        o The left mouse button is the select or "do-it" button.
        o The right mouse button can be used to select a "shortcut"
   command, so that a command is activated. whenever the right
   button is clicked.
        o The mouse pointer changes shape depending on where it is
   on the screen.  On the Map, the pointer is a hand indicating your
   direction of travel.  In the Status Display and Command Levers
   sections of the screen, the pointer changes to a magnifying
   glass.  If you select a command that requires a location, the
   mouse remains a magnifying glass, even on the Map.  The mouse
   changes to a pocket watch in the Message Display.



                              SCREEN LAYOUT

   The game screen is divided into four regions -- the Map, the
   Status Display, the Message  Display, and the Command Levers.



                              THE MESSAGE
                                 DISPLAY

        At the lower right of the screen is the Message Display.
   All text describing things you see and hear, as well as the
   results of your actions, are shown here.
        When a message is too long to fit on the scroll, a flashing,
   downward pointing arrow appears at the bottom of the Display.  To
   View the rest of the message, press the spacebar or position the
   cursor in the Message Display and click the mouse.
        When the game is waiting for keyboard input from you (when
   you are asked a "yes" or "no" question, for example, or when you
   must press <ENTER> to continue), a tiny Mars, orbited by its two
   moons, appears at the end of the current line in the Message
   Display.  Press Y or N, or press <AUER> to continue.

                           THE STATUS DISPLAY

        In the upper right-hand corner of the screen is the Status
   Display.  This normally displays a roster of all the members of
   your party, along with each character's figure and current health
   points.  A character whose health points are printed in red is
   hurt badly; one whose health points are blue is suffering from
   oxygen deprivation; white means a character is freezing; and
   purple indicates radiation poisoning.
        If you click on a character's name, you are shown his
   portrait and statistics.  The higher a statistic is, the better.

   STR (Strength)

        Strength determines how much a character can carry and how
   effectively the character strikes with bludgeoning weapons.

   DEX (Dexteilty)

        Dexterity determines how fast the character is and how well
   the character uses non-bludgeoning weapons such as swords, guns,
   and other ranged weapons.  Faster characters get to move and/ or
   attack more often than slower ones.

   IMT (intelligence)

        For characters other than the Avatar, Intelligence
   determines the ability to anticipate the results of certain
   actions. (Don't give an area-effect weapon with a wide firing arc
   to a character with low intelligence.) Intelligence also affects
   the duration of any psychokinetic powers acquired during the
   game.

   HP (Health Points)

        Health Points indicate the character's current health.  This
   score is reduced by damage from poison and from injuries suffered
   in combat.  Unconsciousness results when a character's HP score
   reaches 0.

   HM (Health Maximum)

        Health Maximum is the maximum number of health points a
   character can have.  If your character's HP and HM scores are the
   same, the character is perfectly healthy.

   Lev (Level)
        Level is an indication of your character's overall prowess.
   Level increases as the character gains experience points (see
   below). Each time a character goes up a level, STR, DEX or INT
   increases. Maximum Health usually goes up, too.
   The character must rest in a tent (see Use, below)--and dream
   while doing so--to increase a level. (You will dream
   automatically when a character is ready to go up a level.)

   XP (Experience Points)
        Experience Points increase as the character accomplishes
   things in the game. Experience Points are earned for defeating
   hostile creatures. Points are lost when a charater is knocked
   unconscious.

                          THE INVENTORY DISPLAY

   To view a character's inventory select one of the figures to the
   left of the roster by clicking on it with your mouse or pressing
   F1-F5.

   [Keyboard]
        The use of the mouse in the Inventory Display is explained
   in detail below.
        To use the keyboard, press the <TAB> key once.  Crosshairs
   appear in the Map window on top of the active character (the
   Avatar urdess you're in solo mode with another character).  This
   selects that character.
        Press <TAB > again and the inventory of the selected
   character appears in the Status Display.  The crosshairs appear
   on the character figure above the inventory.
        Use the arrow keys or the numeric keypad to move the
   crosshairs within the Inventory Display.  When the crosshairs are
   on the item or button you want to select, press <ENTER>.
        To the crosshairs to the map window, press <TAB>.
        The < PLUS > (+) key moves to the next character's Status
   Display.
        The <MINUS > (-) key displays the previous character's
   Status Display.
        Pressing F10 returns to the party roster display.
        The <ASTERISK> (*) key toggles between a character's
   Portrait and Inventory Display in the Status Display.
        The <ESCAPE> key cancels selections and causes the
   crosshairs to disappear.

   [Readied Items]
        On the left side of the Inventory Display is a figure
   showing all equipment the selected characber has readied for
   immedlate use, either held in the hands or wom on the body. (Find
   clothes on board the space bullet as soon as possible-walking
   around Mars without any clothes is dangerous!)
        If you are holding something that requires both hands, the
   obbject will appear in one hand and an "X" will appear in the
   other-you will not be allowed to put anything in that hand.
        To ready or unready an item, click on it with the left mouse
   button.

   [Carried Items]
        On the right side of the Inventory Display are all
   non-readied items carried by the character.
        To look inside a container in your inventory, such as a bag,
   click on it.  Click on it again to return to the main Inventory
   Display.
        To ready a carried item, click on it with the left mouse
   button.



   [Encumbrance]
        Below the readied item figure and the inventory are two
   measures of encumbrance:
        o E shows the weight of items you currently have equipped
   compared to the maximum weight your character is allowed to have
   equipped.
        o I shows the total weight of your entire inventory compared
   to the maximum weight you could possibly carry.  When you view a
   container in your inventory, only the weight of the items in that
   container is shown.




   [Status Display Buttons]
        At the lower left of the Status Display are several buttons.
   As many as five buttons may be displayed at one time, depending
   upon the circumstances. (If you are viewing the last character,
   there is no Show Next Character button, just as there is no Show
   Previous Character option if you're viewing your Avatar.)
        From left to right, the functions of these buttons are:

        o Show Previous Character
        o Return to Party Display
        o Switch between Portrait and Inventory Displays
        o Show Next Character
        o Change Combat Mode (for that character)

        The functions of these buttons are self-explanatory, with
   one exception Change Combat Mode.  You must determine how each
   character in your party will respond when battle is joined.
   There are four combat modes:

        o Attack.  In this mode, a character closes with and attacks
   the nearest enemy.
        o Command.  This allows you to control that characters
   actions each turn, just as you control what your own character
   does.
        o Range.  This tells the character to stay at a safe
   distance and attack with ranged weapons.
        o Flee.  A character in flee mode avoids combat as much as
   pcssible.

        A character's current combat mode is displayed in the bottom
   right-hand corner of the Status Display.  To change modes, click
   the Change Combat Mode button to toggle through the various modes
   until the one you want is displayed.  You can change a
   character's combat mode at any time, even in the middle of a
   battle.

                                THE MAP

        The largest region, on the upper left side of the screen, is
   the Map.  This show the world through which you are moving, with
   the view centered on you (or another member of your party if you
   are in his solo mode).  Above the Map, the current position of
   the sun is shown.

   [Mouse]

        To move your characters with the mouse, position the pointer
   over the Map until it changes to a white pointing hand, point it
   in the direction you wish to move, and click the left button.
   Press and hold the left mouse button to move continuously,
   controlling your direction by steering the white hand.
        Some actions require you to select a location on the Map.
   (You may have to say where you want to drop an item, for
   example.) To select a location, click on it with the left mouse
   button.
        To pass your turn (doing nothing), position the mouse
   pointer over your character and click the left mouse button.

   [Keyboard]

        Move by pressing an arrow key, or one of the eight keys
   around the "5" on the numeric keypad.
        If asked to select where on the Map you want to perform an
   action, use these keys to move a set of crosshairs on the screen
   to the desired location and press <ENTER> to initiate the sction.
        To pass, press the spacebar.

                              THE COMMAND
                                 LEVERS

        Below the map are eight command levers.  With the mouse,
   move the pointer to the command lever you want to use and click
   the left mouse button.  The lever will flip to the 'on," or down,
   position to show that the command has been activated.  Then
   select the object or person you want to use the command on.  To
   enter a command from the keyboard, simply press the first letter
   of its name.
        For frequently used commands, such as Get, Look, Attack or
   Use, you can click the right mouse button to lock a lever in the
   on position.  Click the right button on a command and the lever
   will remain down until you click on a different command with the
   light button.  Click the right button on anv person or object (on
   the map or in your inventory) and the locked command will be
   executed on that object.  You can change the locked command at
   any time.

   Attack (A)

        Attack is used to fight monsters, animals or people, or to
   attempt to destroy objects.  After choosing the Attack command,
   choose a target on the map that is within the range of the weapon
   you have ready.
        The active character can attack at any time, but the other
   party members only assist in combat when you press B to Begin
   Combat.

   Talk (T)

        Talk lets you converse with the people you encounter in the
   game.  You can also speak with the members of your party,
   including Dr. Spector and Nellie Bly, who begin as party members,
   In fact, be sure to ask Nellie for regular updates from her
   notebook-she keeps track of your major accomplishments and goals
   during the game.
        After selecting Talk, select the character on the map you
   wish to speak with.  The speaking character's portrait appears in
   the Status Display while he or she is speaking, and the
   conversation is displayed in the map window.
        You talk by typing single words on the keyboard and pressing
   <ENTER>. Only the first four letters of a word need to be typed.
   For example, the word "dreams" can be shortenecd to DREA.
        Most people will respond to the words NAME, JOB, and BYE
   (BYE ends a conversation, but you can accomplish the same thing
   by pressing <ENTER> without typing anything.) Some people also
   respond to the word JOIN, allowing you to add members to your
   party. (You can have no more than five people in your party.)
        If you or your party members are hurt during play, return to
   the space bullet and Talk with Dr. Blood.  He will do his best to
   restore the injured character(s) to health.
        During the course of conversation, most people give you an
   idea of what they're interested in talking about when you begin
   the game, subjects they want to talk about are highlighted in
   red. This help function can be tumed off, by pressing
   <CONTROL>-H. However, with this help turned off, you'll have to
   figure out for yourself the key words in conversations. Be aware
   that even when help is on, some people also respond to
   unhighlighted subjects.

   Look (L)

        Look allows you to identify anyone or anything at the
   location you select on the map or in your inventory.  When you
   use the Look command on an object you are adocent to, you will
   also search it. This reveals the contents of packs, bags, crates
   and so forth.  It also allows you to find hidden items.

   Get (G)

        Get lets you pick up an object on the map.  If the object
   isn't too heavy to carry, and you have room for it, it will be
   put into your inventory.  Under ordinary circumstances, you must
   be standing next to an object to get it.

   Drop (D)

        Drop can be used to lighten your load by getting rid of
   items you no longer want to carry.  First, select the item in
   your inventory, then choose a spot on the map to place it.
        Select the Drop command and then the object you wish to
   drop. Select a new location for the object and press enter.
        Like the Move command, Drop sometimes prompts you to enter
   the number of items you want to move.  Enter the appropriate
   number and press <ENTER>.  You can press <ENTER> alone to move
   all of them.

   Move (M)

        Move is used to push an item or to transfer it between
   characters in the party.  Select the Move command and then the
   object you wish to move.  Select a new location for the object
   and press <ENTER>.
        Some items (such as cans of oil, bullets and torches) are
   represented by a single picture in your inventory regardless of
   how many you are carrying. (A number below the picture shows how
   many you have.) When you move these items, you are prompted to
   type the number you want to move.  Type the number and press
   <ENTER>.  You can press <ENTER > alone to move all of them.
        If you select an item on the map, you can sometimes push it
   to a position adjacent to where it began.  Living things might
   not let you move them.
        This command can be used to move things in and out of
   containers or from one character to another.  For example, if you
   wish to give something in your inventory to somebody -else,
   select Move, then the object you want to give, and then the
   character receiving it.
        Certain heavy, wheeled ob@s can be moved simply by bumping
   into them. If they become wedged into a particular location, use
   the Move command to pull the object, then back out into the open.

   Use (U)

        In Martian Dreams, most objects have some function.  Use
   lets you operate those objects. Among other things it lets you
   open and close doors, use a tent to rest, light or extinguish
   torches, and play musical instruments.
        To use an object that requires a target, select the target
   when the word "On" appears in the message window.
        For example, early in the game you must use a prybar on a
   hatch.  To do this, click on the Use lever and then on the prybar
   (which can be readied or carried).  When the "On" prompt appears
   in the message window, click on the hatch.  Do this and Nikola
   Tesla will ask you a question to determine whether you are ready
   to venture forth.  Answer his question, use the prybar again, and
   the hatch will pop right off its hinges.
        To play a musical instrument, Use it and press the numbers 0
   through 9 to sound individual notes.  Press <ENTER> when
   finished.
        One weapon, the Belgian combine, can be Used as a shotgun, a
   rifle, or a combination of the two.  To set the combine to one of
   these, Use it and enter S for shotgun, R for rifle, or C for a
   combination.
        Two Martian weapons-the heat ray and the freeze rav-can also
   be used in a variety of ways.  For a single, narrow ray, Use
   these weapons and select the rifle (R) setting; for a wide beam,
   select the shotgun (s) setting; for a simultaneous ray and beam
   attack, select the combination (C) setting.
        Be sure to aquire a sextant early in your adventure---Use it
   and it will provide you with the latitude and longitude of your
   current location. This  will allow you to return to the spot at a
   later date. In some cases, characters will tell you to go
   someplace and give you coordinates--the sextant can help you find
   those places.


   Begin/Break Off Combat (B)

        This switches back and forth between party mode and combat
   mode. In party mode, the members of your party automatically
   follow you around. In combat mode, each character behaves
   according to the combat mode you have selected for them on thier
   Inventory Display.

                     OTHER KEYBOARD COMMANDS

        In addition to the mouse/keyboard commands already
   described, several keyboard-only commands will come in handy
   during play.

   1.2.3.4.5

        Each of these number keys activates solo mode for its
   corresponding party member.  In solo mode, the party member
   selected can move around and perform actions while the rest of
   the party waits inactively.  You cannot engage in conversation
   while in solo mode.  Characters in solo mode shouldwt stray too
   far from the other party members.

   0 (Zero)

        This key retums you to party mode from solo mode.  The
   previously inactive characters rejoin the character that was in
   solo mode.

   <CTRL>-S

        <CTRL>-S saves your current game position.  Save frequently
   during play and aluwys save before trying anything

   <CTRL>-R

        <CTRL>-R restores your last saved' game.  Anything you've
   done, good or bad, since the last time you -saved will be gone.
   The game is returned to the exact position you last saved.

   <CTRL>-Q

        <CTRL>-Q ends your current play session and retums you to
   DOS.  The game is not saved when you select this option.

   <CTRL>-A

        <CTRL>-A toggles the music on and off.

   <CML>-Z

        <CTRL>-Z toggles the sound effects on and off.

   F1-F5

        Each of these function keys activates the Status/ Inventory
   Display for its corresponding party member.

   Escape

        <ESCAPE> aborts most game functions.  Press <ESCAPE> if you
   select a command or press a key by mistake.

                              - FOREWORD -

   I write these words aboard a colossal bullet rocketing from the
   Earth to Mars.  Wondrous as this is (and it is, I assure you,
   quite wondrous), I am even more amazed by the fact that it is the
   year 1895! Tesla - yes, the noted scientist of years pasi, Nikola
   Tesla! is unsure how long tEe voyage will take, so I have decided
   to pass the time recordina what mankind (circa 1895) knows of our
   destination Mars.  How I came by this information is a story in
   itself:
        Scientists have lono suspected that Mars was capable of
   supporting intellic,ent life.  As early as 1877, Italian
   astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped nearly eighty "canali"
   criss-crossing the Nlartian surface - canals that he said
   couldn't
   possibly be the work of chance.
        Among the scientists who followed in Schiaparelli's
   footsteps
   was an American, Percival Lowell, who in the early 1890's began
   sludving the canals and other features of Mars.  Remarkably, no
   late-20th century sources record the fact that Lowell did more
   than study the red planet from a distance - in 1893 he
   constructed
   a giant space cannon to send an expedition there!
        When the cannon accidentally discharged ahead of schedule
   (with several notable figures of the day aboard) most observers
   agreed that the explosion must have vapofized the huge
   bullet-ship
   within, killing the passengers instantly.  Luckily, the
   extraordinarily inventive Nikola Tesla, one of Lowell's
   associates
   ori the space cannon project, remained optimistic about the fate
   of those aboard the craft.
        As planned, Tesla went ahead with ihe construction of a
   system of reflectors which would allow him to flash Morse code
   messages to the expedition (which had, in fact, crash-landed on
   the red planet), Lowell set up a matching system of mirrors and
   was able to send messages about what he and the other explorers
   discovered on Mars.
        Having read through the  transcripts  of  Lowell's
   messages,
        I  find myself puzzled - the Mars he described in his
   messages is sovery different than the one we of the late 20th
   century know. What could have changed the planet so in just 100
   years? How could the Mariner and Viking spacecraft have missed
   such clear evidence of Martian life? I most know the answers to
   these questions. Perhaps we will uncover them during our
   explorations.




        It seems likely that Lowell himself knows the answers, but
   he is either unwilling or unable to tell us.  His Morse code
   messages ended abruptly not long after the first expedition
   landed on the red planet.  Why they ceased we do not know, but
   cease they did.  The information in this joumal is, therefore,
   incomplete.  Still, I will endeavor to record all that mankind
   knows of Mars. The facts - if facts they be - may prove
   invaluable to my fellow space travellers in the days and weeks
   following our landing on Mars.

                    PLANETARY DATA & GEOGRAPHY

   THOUGH details have changed, much of what 20th century man knows
   of the red planet still appears to be accurate in 1895: Mars is
   the fouilh planet from the Sun.  The Martian day lasts 24 hours,
   37 minutes.  Its year is 687 Earth days long.  Iiselliptical
   orbit takes Mars as close as 128 million miles lo the Sun and as
   far away as 15@ million miles.  Iis distance from Earth ranges
   from 40 million miles lo 250 million miles. The diameter of Mars
   is 422L' miles at the equator, but only 4195 miles through the
   poles.  Its mass is significantly lower than that of the Eanh.
   The gravitational pull of Mars is, therefore, 60 percent lower
   than that of Eanh.  For this reason, Mars loses hydrogen and
   oxygen, the components of water, at a rate equivalent to 60,000
   gallons of water a day.  Another interesfing effect of Mars' weak
   gravity is that escape velocity is only 11,214 mph, far less than
   the 25,000 mph required to escape the confines of Earth.


                   Basins, Craters & Planitia

   OVERALL, Mars has suffered neither more nor less from meteor and
   asteroid strikes than ihe other inner planets.  Still, Mars'
   proximity to the asteroid belt has resulted in periodic bombard-
   ments that are especially heavy.  Sixteen impact craters with a
   diameter of 150 miles or greater have been clearly identified.
   These large, flat basins are called "planitia."
        The Argyre planilia, -approximately 350 miles across. is
   surrounded by mountains.  Passaoe throuah these mountains @s
   thouoht to be all but impossible.
        The basin-like areas of central Mars are somewhat
   different than Hollas, Argyre, and the other larae impact basins
   the central planitia are believed to be lava plains created long
   ago by the eruption of the Tharsis voicanoes.



                        Caverns & Canyons

   The surface of Mars is marred bv countless crevasses,
   chasms, and fossae (miles-long, trough-like ditches).
   IT The system of canyons we of the laic 20th century call Valles
   Marineris is 1550 miles long, 125 miles wide at its widest point,
   and 2.2 miles deep at its deepest.  It @warfs Earth's magnificent
   Grand Canyon (280 miles long, I 8 miles wide at its widest point,
   and a little more than a mile deep) - irl fact, the Valles
   Marineris would extend all the way from Chicago to Califomia.
   The careless explorer could easily find himself lost in the
   twisisting passages of this magnificent valley.
        Noctis Labyrinthus, at the westem edge of the Valles
   Marineris system. is a complex maze cf interconnecting channels.
   Three smaller (thouch no less maze-likt) chasms link Noctis
   Labvrinthus with Coprates Chasma.  We must be careful to map
   these areas carefully should we be forced to explore them in the
   course of completing our mission.
         Amazingly, Valles Marinen's is itself part of a system of
   canyons 2800 miles long, 435 miles wide at its broadest point,
   and over four miles deep.  This canyon system would stretch all
   the way across the United States!
        Unlike Earth canyons, which are carved by running water,
   Martian canyons often appear closed at both ends (meaning water
   could not have flowed into or out of them).  On the other hand,
   the equatorial regions of Mars are marked by what are gererally
   agreed to be dry river beds.  Many of the canyons of Valles
   Mar-ine6s spill out into these dried dver beds.  No one knows how
   'he canyons of Mars were really tonned.  Perhaps our expedition
   can solve this fascinating Martian fiddle.
        In addition to canyons, Mars is @ddled with underground
   tunnels and passages, some natural, others carved out eons ago by
   the sentient Martian race.  Some of these tunnels are home to
   Martian wildlife, while others lead to underground factories (see
   below).  Here again, the watchword for would-be Martian
   spelunkers
   will be caution.  Accurate maps may be all that stand between
   survival and certain death.


                             Dust Storms

        Dust is the most common feature of the Martian surface.
   Small particles are often waited aloft, while larger particles,
   picked up by the wind, roll and bounce along the ground.
   Extreme temperature contrasts. particularly near the poles and
   in the Hellas region, create violent winds - up to 280 miles per
   heur and raging dust storms.  Tomade-like condifions are common
   and quite deadly, often whipping the sandy surface of Mars to a
   stinging frenzy.  Flyina dust often blots out the entire surface
   and blinds the unwary explorer.
        Lowell repens that the only thing to do if one spots a
   Martian dust storm is to run away.  Seek shelter as quickly as
   possible.

                               Ice Caps

   MARS is devoid of surface Water.  Most of the water that does
   exist is locked up in huae ice caps at the poles.  The north pole
   is largely composed of water ice, while the south pole is a
   combination of water and frozen carbon dioxide.
        Lowell theorized that the Martians melted small portions of
   the polar ice masses to fill their canals and irrigate the
   equatorial region.  Gargantuan lowers located near the north pole
   appear to have been part of an elaborate system for fillinc, the
   canals, but the rivers of polar exploration stymied the 1893
   expedition's efforts to investigate.


                         Mountains & Voicanoes

   Mars features some of the tallest and most rugged mountains and
   volcanoes in the known universe.  The voicanoes of Mars are note
   worthy for reasons other than their prodioious Height - they
   appear to have been formed from iron-rich, basattic lava.  The
   possibility exists that Mars may one day provide much of
   mankind's iron ore and steel.
        Just north of the equator is the Tharsis bulge, a raised
   plain some five miles high and as far across as the United
   Staies.
   Tharsis boasts some of the highest points in the solar system.
   Olympus Mons is the tallest volcano known to exist (90,000 feet
   h@gh and well over 350 miles across!).  By contrast, Mount
   Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, is only 29,000 feet high.
   Three slightly smaller volcanoes - Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons,
   and Arsia Mons (each "just" six miles high) sit atop the Tharsis
   bulge in a diagonal line southeast of Olympus.
        The Elysium buloe rises 2.5 miles above the surface and
   features somewhat smaller volcanoes than Tharsis.  Only ihree of
   the Elysium mountains are as much as 93 miles across.  The
   tallest
   of them, Elysium Mons, stands 5.5 miles high.  Albor Tholus and
   Hecates Tholus, nearby, are a bit sinallel. Fortunately for us,
   none of the volcanoes of Mars appear to be active!

                      HUMAN SURVIVAL ON MARS

   The hard facts on the preceding pages appear to have changed
   little during the 20th century.  The same cannot be said of other
   'Taspects of Mars. Though not as wild and fantastic as Edoar Rice
   Burroughs imagined in his John Carter books, Mars is far from the
   dead planet known to modem science.
        Percival Lowell theorized that Mars was in the process of
   coolina and losing its atmosphere, but it was not yet completely
   dead.  His trip to the red planet appears to have proved his
   theories.  Mars circa 1895 is capable of supporting life.  Native
   I ifeforrns abound, and mankind can, with difficulty, survive the
   planet's harsh conditions.  Among the dancers we can expect will
   be intense cold and an atmosphere far thinner and lower in oxygen
   than Earth's.

                                Cold

   THE Martian surface temperature varies with the location, the
   season and the time of day.  The astronomers of the late 20th
   century report IT temperatures as low as -250 degrees Fahrenheit
   and as high as 90, with a typical range of -22 to - 1 12 degrees.
        Curiously, Lowell found Mars to be significantly warmer,
   though still dangerously cold.  The most hazardous @me is between
   the hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. We must be sure to set up camp
   during these hours and consider remaining in an insulated tent
   until daylight.  We also have a supply of heavy clothing to help
   keep us warm.

                                Oxygen

        THE atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than that of Earth.
   By the 1990s, it was well established that  the  atmospheric
   pressure on Mars was just one percent that of Earlh.
        Hoever, the Mars explored by Lowell seems far more
   hospitable than modem science would have us believe.  Still, we
   will soon land on a planet just barely capable of sustaining
   life, We most anticipate reduced endurance, at the very least,
   when we disembark.
        The Lowell expedition discovered a substance called oxium
   that makes life on Mars far more pleasant.  The discovery of the
   gooey, foul-tasting, life-giving substance was pure luck - an o@d
   miner named Cooter McGee, gaspin- for breath and half mad from
   lack of oxygen, happened to stumble into a cave littered with
   geodes emitting air! When he broke open one of the aeodes he
   found a blue gelatin within.  Despite the horrid odor he popped a
   wad in his mouth and began to chew.  The taste was awful, but
   each bile released a bit of oxygen.  He knew in an instant that
   he held the key to mankind's survival on Mars.
        He dubbed the substance "oxium," and it quickly became both
   a necessity of life and the stranded expedition's primary form of
   currency.  It was traded for all manner of foodstuffs, minerals,
   objects, and Martian artifacts.  He who has oxium is assured of
   both health and wealth.

                                FLORA & FAUNA
   As recently as the late ' 1800's, Mars teemed with life.  As
   dangerous as the cold and lack 'of oxygen may be, the most
   serious threat 10 Ahuman life on Mars is the danger posed by
   these decidebly alien and often hostile creatures.
        According to Lowell's reports, there is l@ttle difference
   between those Martian lifeforms described as "flora" and those we
   would call "fauna." All Martian life appears to fall into one of
   two categories: There are plant-like creatures (dubbed
   "plantimals" by Iowell) and worin-like creatures.
         All plantimals grow from seeds, spending at least a portion
   of their "youths" rooted in the ground.  When seedlings near
   maturity, pods appear on the plant.  Within each pod a new
   plantimal grows. ne pods grow quite large and eventually burst,
   releasing fully grown creatures.
        While the pods are growing, plantimals derive nonfishment
   from the ground, just like Earth plants, but they also acquire
   something more plantimals are capable of extracting species
   specific information from the soil in which they're planted! In
   other words, the instincts of dembers of the seedling's species
   that have died in the vicinity become part of the seedling's own
   makeup.  Each youngster acquires the "wisdom" of its
   predecessors.
   In the case of most wandering plantimals, little knowledge is
   passed on.  In the case of the sentient Martians, the benefits of
   passing along multi-generational racial knowledge were dramatic.
        Note that the red pods growing on some adult creatures are
   edible seed pods - fruit.  The seeds are scattered when a piece
   of fruit falls from its host creature and bursts, allowing the
   seeds to be blown about by the Martian winds.  Seeds can also be
   spread when herbivorous creatures pluck and eat the fruit of
   other creatures (in a curious blurring of the distinction between
   camivore and herbivore).  The indigestible seeds pass through the
   creature when it eliminates solid waste.  Eventually the seeds
   take root and the cycle begins again.
        The worm-like creatures differ dramatically from plantimals
   in appearance, habitat, and behavior.  They are often shelled and
   generally avoid the extreme conditions of the Martian surface,
   living wellprotected beneath the surface.  Worms are almost
   always aggressive,
        The unexplained disappearance of some members of the 1893
   expedition led to rumors of the existence of mysterious,
   horrible, and deadly Martian creatures.  Whether Mars is home to
   unidentified creatures and whether they are plant or worm is, as
   yet, a mystery.
        Here is a listing of all creatures known to exist on Mars.
   The list may not be complete and further investigation is
   definitely in order.



   Airsquid
   No Earthly equivalent exists for this, perhaps the strangest and
   most surprising of Martian creatures.  The camivorous airsquid is
   a remarkable combination of hawk, squid, and jellyfish.  It
   floats. seemingly harmless, through the sky, its body suspended
   below a distended bag filled with hydrogen gas.  Blessed with
   keen eyesight, it can spot prey at great distances.  When it
   finds a victim, the airsquid drops in vicious, gravity-aided
   attack. Sharp teeth, a tearing beak, and grasping tentacles make
   the airsquid a hideous and effective enemy.  Not surprisingly,
   the first expedition reports no siahtings underground.  The
   airsquid seems willing to float anywhere prey is to be found.
   There is no place on the Martian surface free of these deadly
   creatures.

   Ammonoid
   This primitive, snail-like creature dwells exclusively in the
   dank, dark Martian underworld. Its spiky, thomed shell provides
   ample protection against attack.  Its tentacles allow it to grasp
   prey, but the real danger posed by the ammonoids is the buming
   acid secreted from suckers on the lower tentacle surface.

   Bushato
   The plains areas are home to this bison- or buffalo-like
   herbivore. Herds of bushalo can ,T generally be found near the
   wandering forests, feasting on the small plants found in and
   around the woods.  Though normally sedate, these massive,
   hippopotamus-sized creatures are easily provoked.  The charge of
   a bushato. wood-like tusks clacking, is something to behold -
   from a distance.  The best advice that can be given is to leave
   these creatures alone unless it is absolutely necessary to
   disturb them.

   Busbrat
   Here is a curious anomaly - one of the few plantimals to be found
   both above and below around.  How these rat-like scaveniers
   survive without the light of the sun so necessary to other plants
   is a mystery.  Perhaps it is akiri to Earth saprophytes
   non-pholosynthesizing plants that survive on decaying organic
   matter.  Busbrats can be found everywhere, feeding on the remains
   of dead worms and the kills of surface-dwelling carnivores.
   Small, quick and blessed with razor sharp teeth and claws,
   bushrats are surprisingly dangerous when provoked.

   Canal Worm
   No human has ever seen one of these creatures, but several
   circular tapestries found in the Martian cities depict what
   Lowell believes to have been huge, canal-dwelling worms.  Several
   features are immediately apparent.  They had huge maws full of
   row upon row of shark-like teeth.  They must surely have been
   quite ferocious, attacking anything that moved on or near the
   canals.  And they were large enough to swallow a man whole.
   Perhaps it is a blessing that the canals are empty and mankind
   need never fear these awesome beasts.

   Cave Worm
   Unlike its distant relafive, the extinct canal worm, cave worms
   are quite real and quite deadly.  These glowing, shelled cave
   dwellers can grow to lengths up to ten feet, but a spitting
   attack makes them a threat al far greater distances, Once prey
   comes with in reach, a cave worm uses graspino tentacles to
   squeeze the life from its victims Like many Martian creatures,
   the cave worm secretes a bumino acid throueh its skin.  Victims
   are, in essence, rendered down to liquid which the mouthless worm
   absorbs throgoh its skin.

   Creeper
   This rootless, leafy vine is the above-ground equivalent of the
   cave worm.  Its natural habitats are the mountainous reoions of
   Mars, though ii will travel as far as necessary to find food.  It
   squirms about the surface and attacks by wrappine itself around
   its victims and suffocating them.  The creeper tends to be shy,
   attacking only when requiring one of its infrequent feedings, but
   it can respond viciously to provocation.

   Creeping Cactus
   Among the odder Martian creatures, this hybrid of cactus and sea
   urchin rnoyes by ?,inflating its rear pods and de tating the ones
   ahead, pushing it slowly across the surface. This is probably a
   variation on the night mechanism used by the air squid, but the
   creeping cactus is too heavy to get off the ground.  Despite
   their weight, the strong Martian winds often send creeping cacti
   tumbling across the plains, like tumbleweed. Unlike tumbleweed,
   however, the creeping cactus has pointy spines that can inflict
   surprisingly serious damage.

   Glow Worm
   Though similar in appearance to their cousins, the rockworms,
   glow worms are quite harrniess.  Found only in the maze-like IT
   underground passages of Mars, thes e shy creatures shrink into
   their shells at the approach of any creature larger than a
   bushrat. For reasons we can hardly guess, glow worms usually
   cluster at points where passageways curve or reach a dead end.
   Underground explorers quickly came to consider the creatures
   their friends for, as their name indicates, they glow quite
   fiercely.  Whether this display is designed to scare away
   would-be attackers, to blind underground predators used to the
   dark, or to accomplish some other, unknown goal is a subje@t
   worthy of further study.

   Hedgehog
   This belligerent, mid-sized camivore fills the ecological niche
   of Earth wolves.  Woody tusks, sharp fangs, and thoms that can be
   sent flying through the air make the lone hedgehog quite
   formidable.  Unfortunately, they often travel in packs, making
   them even more of a threat.  A group of hedgehogs can take down a
   bushalo with ease, and can even give a sextelleger a hard time.
   Be ever alert for hedgehogs - they range far and wide and can be
   found anywhere on the planet.

   Jumping Bean
   The rabbit-like jumping bean looks almost comical as it traverses
   the Martian landscape with a peculiar hopping gait.  Don't be
   ,deceived by its looks, however, or its herbivorous nature -
   beans are quite aggressive.  In fact, they're just plain nasty,
   seemingly for the fun of it. (How else do you explain an
   herbivore that attacks without provocation?) A pack of jumping
   beans is quite dangerous, giving pause even to the camivores of
   Mars.

   Oxy-leech
   This slug-like under-round life form feeds on oxium.
   Unfonunately, these primitive creatures make no distinction
   between veins of oxium ore and travelling adventurers with oxium
   in their packs.  The oxy-leech has a hideous. toothy mouth
   opening, but does very little physical damaue, preferrin(y to
   steal oxiuni and flee before victims can react.  Generally found
   near cave entrances and in ravines, the oxy-leech is a disoustina
   creature, but more a nuisance than a genuine threat.

   Plantelope
   The gazelle-like plantelope may remind explorers of its
   smaller cousin, the jumpino IT bean.  Normally docile, it
   tends to be shy, choosing to flee rather than ficht in almost
   every case.  The plains are its customary feeding grounds, though
   herds of plantelope have been seen leaping goat-like in the
   mountainous areas of Mars.

   Planther
   Fast, agile, and deadly, the planther is at the top of the
   plantimal food chain.  Though it rarely attacks the larger
   herbivores, a hungry specimen of the breed can chase down
   sextelleger (with some difficulty ... ).
   Planthers tend to be loners, slicking to the mountainous regions
   they love, but they move into the plains areas and travel in
   small prides during pollination season.

   Pod Devil
   Here is a creature with no Earthly equivalent.  Three times
   during the Martian year, the mysterious pod devil blooms.
   Anywhere from five to 30 pods appear on each mature adult.
   Within each pod, a young devil begins to grow.  If left alone,
   the pods drop to the ground and a fully grown pod devil emerges.
   If the "mother" plant is disturbed before the "babies" reach full
   [Aatufity, a variable number of pods burst, releasing immature
   (and quite vicious) devils.  The young are bipedal, frog-like
   whirlwinds of teeth and claws.  They have been reported to attack
   from a distance by hurling small stones, an indication of
   relatively high intelligence.  If one of the prematurely-released
   young dies, a new pod devil plant grows on the spot. thus
   assuring the continuation of the species.



   Proto-Martian
   Though the sentient Martian race became extinct long before
   man set foot on the red planet, a primitive relative manaoed
   to survive.  Though nowhere near as intelligent as their
   ancient cousins, the omnivorous proto-martians are clearly the
   top of the heap among the remaining plant creatures. (For the
   sake of comparison, think of protomartians as somewhere between
   gorillas and human cavemen in intellect.) Alone among plantimals,
   the proto-martians travel in bands and use crude weapons (sticks,
   hurled rocks, and so on). They generally live near the bases of
   mountains, seeking the shelter of caves.  They have also been
   spotted roaming the plains, living in crudely constructed
   shelters.  Be wamed that proto-martians are not intellioent
   enough to reason with. Consider them clever, dangerous animals.

   Rockworm
   HESE gigantic tube worms live coiled up under the earih IT with
   only a hard, slime-covered tube visible at the surface.  The
   tubes are made of a caustic material regurgitated by the worm.
   This same acidic ooze coals and lubricates the rockworm's body,
   allowina it to emeroe with stariling speed from its subterranean
   resting place.  The slightest vibration on the surface draws the
   rockworm out.  The speed of its attack, the caustic ooze, and a
   horrible thomy maw make each rockworm a threat.  Making matters
   worse, rockwon-ns tend to clump together in colonies and can be
   vicious when provoked.  They are best left undisturbed whenever
   possible.

   Sand Trapper
   These large, pod-like creatures would appear to be easily avoided
   they are completely immobile.  Appearances can be deceiving,
   however.  Like the Earth insect known as the ant lion (or, more
   popularly, the "doodlebug"), the sand trapper uses the lower
   portion of its abdomen as a shovel and dias itself a deep,
   conical pit in the loose sand of the plains.  Any plantimal,
   worm, or human who gets too close loses its fooling in the loo@se
   sand and falls to the bottom, where the creature waits to devour
   it.  Even potential victims who don't fall within reach of the
   waiting creature have little chance of climbing out as the sand
   shifts beneath their feet.  Escape is made even more difficult by
   the trapper's grasping. ropy tentacles.
   All in all, the sand trapper is a devouring machine - little more
   than a huge mouth lined with Tazor sharp teeth.  A spitting
   attack can send a man tumbling down the slopes of its trap and
   into its waiting jaws.  Don't be lulled into a sense of false
   security by its immobility.  The sand Trapper is quite deadly.

   Sextelleger
   Here is another Martian plantimal with nc) Earthly equivalent.
   No other creature encountered by Lowell and the others was
   considered more dangerous or more malevolent.  Even the planther
   thinks twice before attacking o fully-grown sextelleger.  The
   six-legoed beast can only be described as a camivorcus
   rhinoceros.  A lone sextelleger is a menace, but one seldom
   encounters a lone sextelleger - the creatures travel in herd,,,,
   killing and devouring anything and everything in their paths.

   Trees
   The pod-trees are not true plantimals like the other lifeforms of
   Mars, but they are, nonetheles, worthy of inclusion in a
   compendium of Martian creatures.  Unlike Earth trees, Martian
   trees are capable of limited movement.  For reasons not fully
   understood by human explorers, the trees clump together in
   forests and then wander together across the plains of Mars,
   usually in the vicinity of the canals.
        Explorers quickly detemined that it was not worth their time
   and energy to map either the location of the forests or the paths
   throuoh them.  The next time they reached an area through which
   they had passed earlier, the paths had changed and, in some
   cases, the entire forest had moved!




                    THE MYSTERY OF THE BERRIES
   The 1893 explorers sent many coded messaoes back to Earth.  All
   of them were fantastic, but none were more remarkable than those
   pertaining to tvlartian berries.  Before the messa@es stopped,
   Geor@e Washington Carver, noted agricuttufist and one of the
   members of the 1893 expedition, catalogued many species of
   immobile, non-sentient plants.  At leas( three of these bore
   fruit, specifically beefies.  When eaten, these berries
   reportedly conferred upon the user strange and inexplicable
   psychic abilities.
        Some who used the berries claimed to be able to read minds
   (clairvoyance) or carry on conversations with inanimate objects
   (psychometry).  Others reportedly gained the ability to move and
   use objects at a distance (telekinesis).  Modem science generally
   deilies the possibility of such powers, but then modem science
   also denies the existence of life on Mars.  Perhaps it would be
   best to approach the subject of the Martian berries with an open,
   inquisitive mind.


                          MARTIAN CIVILIZATION
   The irrefutable evidence of sentient life on Mars leads
   inevitably to questions about who and what the Martians were.
   What was their lifestyle? How advanced was their civilization and
   how was it structured? After the members of the 1893 expedition
   determined that they could, in fact, surviv@ on Mars, George
   Washington Carver began seeking answers to these questions.
        All available evidence ted Carver to conclude that the
   one-time masters of Mars were sentient plant-creatures - highly
   evolved plantimals, if you will. The remains of cities and towns
   called "groves"-and the remarkable artifacts found in these
   settlements indicate a high level of civilization.

   Life Cycle
   Like all Martian plantimals and, for that matter, all Earthly
   plants, the sentient Martians (to be called simply "Martians"
   from here on) were born when seeds were planted in the ground,
   watered, nourished by sunlight and minerals, and protected from
   worms and camivorous plantimals.  However, Carver's study of
   records left by the Martians indicate that they grew to maturity
   somewhat different ]y than their non-sentient cousins.
        First, each Martian plant grew just a sinale pod, and these
   pods didn't split open naturally when the creature within reached
   maturity. in fact, if left on the plant, Martian pods would
   become overripe, killing the young one within.
        For that reason, the Martians tended their pods carefully
   and, using a knife-like implement specifically designed for the
   job, split the pod open at just the right time, releasing the
   "young" male or female Martian.  The new organism was fully
   aware, but not fully mature.  Were it not for the protection and
   guidance provided within the walls of the Martian groves, the
   young could not have survived.
        The Martian life cycle began with an elaborate sexual rituat
   involving a male, a female, and a species of now extinct flying
   worm Carver called a "pollinator." The parties involved would
   gather in a sunny greenhouse in the couple's home grove.  The two
   Martians would kneel across from each other as pollinators
   fluttered about them.  The worms would land on the male, picking
   up a dusting of pollen, and then land on a rut of flower-like
   structures about the female's neck and shoulders.
        The pollinated flowers eventually grew into seeds which
   ringed the female, like strings of pearls.  When the seeds had
   grown, they were gathered and given to the Cultivator, who
   planted and tended them in a communal plot.  Eventually, the
   seeds grew into seedlings and then into
   fully grown plants.  The plants  crew  pods  and  the  cycle  was
   complete. The  existence  of  communal  plots  was  probably  the
   most telling difference between the Martians and their
   non-sentient cousins - they tended to settle in a few places and
   buried generation after generation of their dead in a few
   preciselv defined locations. Seeds planted in these locations
   acquired knowledge and characteristics not only from the previous
   generation, but from all generations stretching back many
   thousands of years.
          The germ of true intellioence was clearly present in the
   Martians from the very beginnina - they, alone among plantimals,
   realized the potential benefits of settling in a sin(,Ie
   location. Still, given what we know of life on Mars, the
   resulting concentration of racial memory in a single location
   surely contributed to their dominance of the planet.

   Martian Life & Social Structure
   While Carver studied the Martian life cycle, anthropologist David
   Yellin began a systematic study of the Martian lifestyle was
   recorded in scrolls and reflected in surviving Martian groves and
   artifacts.
        According to Yellin, the secret of Martian success was
   rootedness.  Once a Martian family (or group of families) settled
   in an area, it remained there, to the benefit of each succeeding
   generation.  Thus, each grove is found toda on the same spot it
   occupied at the dawn of Martian civilization.
        Martian groves consisted of several homes arrayed around a
   central grave/nursery plot, the whole protected against nomadic
   plantimals by a stout wall.  The homes were, not surprisingly,
   made entirely of glass or crystal.  In other words, the Martians
   lived in greenhouses, not unlike the marvelous crystal palaces
   beloved by the Victorians.
        The rule among Martians seems to have been "one-home, one-
   Martian." Since all seeds were planted in a communal birthing
   plot,there were no families - in a sense, all Martians living in
   a grove were one family- When a Martian died, its body was carned
   to the birthina, plot and buried there.  As the body decomposed,
   all of its accumulated memories and experiences were, through
   some unknown mechanism, transferred into the soil, to be soaked
   up by seedlings planted there.  Thus the seedlings acquired the
   knowledge of all previous generations in that location.
        Each Martian birthing plot was tended by the community's
   Cultivator.  This Martian held the fate of his community in his
   threefingered hands.  If the plot were damaged, the development
   of subsequent generations could be set back severely.  If the
   damage were so great that the community had to move and find a
   new plot, a small amount of dirt would be collected from the plot
   and carried to a new location.  Martian records indicate that
   this only rarely resulted in success.  Needless to say, the
   Cultivator was held in the highest respect.
        Assisting the Cultivator was the Gatherer.  The Martian who
   held this position gathered all of the leaf droppings and other
   plant matter and kept up the community's compost heap.  Ile
   Gatherer was also responsible for bringing the deod to the
   birthing plot, where their knowledge could be imparted to
   succeeding generations.
        Another Martian, the Arbofist, healed the sick and wounded.
   This involved taking cuttings, healing diseases, grafting limbs,
   and so on.
        Coordinating the activities of these key Martians and seeing
   to the everyday needs of the citizens of each grove was the
   Agrarian.  'Mink of the Agrarian as akin to a human Mayor and you
   won't be too far off the mark.  In addition to intemal affairs,
   this Martian negotiated water fights with other groves and took
   responsibility for inter-grove soil trading.  Such trading
   ensured the widespread dissemination of knowledge and
   enriched the overall Martian stock.  The Agrarian also made sure
   the underground power plants and facto6es were well-maintained,
   ensuring the continued idyllic existence of Martians on the
   surface.
        Martian records indicate that there were once scores of
   groves.  Today, only four are intact enough to reveal anything of
   Martian life (to say nothing of sheltering the members of the
   1893 expedition).  Olympus, Argyre, Hellas, and Elysium are in
   surprisingly good repair.  Other scattered buildings only hint at
   the tonner greatness of Martian civilization.

   Factories, Mines & Mechanical Men
   All of Martian civilization was built on the idea thal the groves
   were inviolate, edenic, never to be sullied by machinery.  The
   idyllic existence above ground was made possible by moving
   underground all of the machinery and mining operations that made
   such a life feasible.
        Power was generated by scores of hulking steam engines, each
   as large as the monstrous Corliss engine displayed at the 1876
   Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.  Canvas belts conveyed
   power to a vast array of machines.  The material to build and
   power these machines iron ore, coal, and other substances - came
   from colossal mines as grand as any in human history.
        The steam-powered underground machines must have roared
   deafeningly in their day, but now they sit idle, waiting for
   someone to figure out how to restore the power that once drove
   them.  Today, countless years after the death of the last
   Martian, dirt and grit cover every unprotected surface.  And the
   stench in the factories, powerplants, and mines is nearly
   overpowering.
         The underground factories and mines are, along with the
   canals, the most remarkable displays of Martian industrial
   prowess.  The achievement seems all the more amazing when one
   considers that, like Earth plants, the Martians required sunlight
   in order to survive.  Ilis made underground work taxing and
   potentially deadly.  The Martians solved this problem in a most
   straichtforward, yet astonishing, manner.
        in order to tend the machines, the Martians created metal
   surrogates, specialized devices that we of the late 20th century
   would call robots.  Lowell dubbed them "mechanical men."
   The mechanical men vary widely in appearance and, we can only
   assume, in function.  Unfortunately, the underground areas are
   sufficiently dangerous that Lowell and the others did little
   investigating.  The nature and functioning of the mechanical men
   remains, therefore, a mystery.

   Canals
   Inredible as it seems.  Schiaparelli and Lowell were right - the
   canals on Mars are real.  Great causeways once carried water from
   the poles to irrigate the more arid areas.  This alone made it
   possible for the Martians to settle in on@ place and build their
   mighty groves.  That the canals could also be used to transport
   Martians and materials from place to place was an added benefit.
   Their chief purpose was to ensure the survival and continued
   dominance of the Martian race.
        Though the canals now stand empty, and many mysteries still
   remain, Lowell was able to determine quite a bit about them.
   They are all perfectly straight, with perfect, right-angle
   intersections.  Their depth and width make them impassible when
   empty.  Extensible bridges allow travellers to cross.
   Unfortunately, nearly all of the bridges are retracted
   and wilt-remain so until and unless we can restore power tO the
   Martian cities.  Larce switches at the edoes of the canals can be
   used to extend and retract bridoes.
        Curiously, there would appear to be a bit of water below the
   surface near the canals - plants can almost always be found
   growing in the vicinity of the empty waterwavs.
        Lowell was able to tell much about the canals by
   observation,
   but one question remained unanswered: How A,ere they filled?
   Robert Peary, noted polar explorer, may have provided the answer.
   During his trek to the edges of the Martian icecaps, he came
   across gigantic towers positioned at strate-ic locations alona
   the edge of the north pole.  Atop each tower was a ruby-red lens.
   It may be that the sun's light, focused by the lens, melted the
   ice and channeled water into the canals.  This is. however,
   nothing more than conjecture.
        Needless to say, the empty canals limit movement on the
   planet's surface and hinder exploration.  The non-functioning
   switches and extensible bridges do little but frustrate would-be
   explorers.  If ihere were only some way to restore power to the
   Martian machinery! Then. perhaps, mankind could explore Mars more
   fully.

   Dream Machines
   As astoundino as the Martian groves, factories, and canals are,
   nothing excited the'members of 1893 expedition more than the
   mysterious dream machines.  No one is really sure what purpose
   these devices served, but users reportedly experienced strange,
   dreamlike visions (hence the name "dream machine").  Nothin(Y
   more is known about these devices - among the few machines still
   functionina when the Lowell expedition arrived on Mars.
        Shortly after the first reports were beamed to Earth
   concerning the dream machines.  Lowell described a breakdown in
   communication
   among various groups of humans.  The once united expedition
   degenerated into several bickering factions.  Little more is
   known about events on Mars.  No one knows if there is any
   connection between the dream machines and the disintegration of
   the 1893 expedition - shortly after these reports reached Earth,
   communication ended-The dream machines appear to be at the heart
   of several mysteries.  We must investigate, but cautiously...

                          MYSTERIOUS RED PLANET
   Having reflected on the messages Lowell sent from Mars, I find
   myself drawn once again to the remarkable differences between the
   Mars of Mariner and Viking and the Mars of Percival Lowell.  What
   cataclysm could have wiped all trace of Martian civilization from
   the face of the red planet? What catastrophe could have caused
   ihe
   extinction of so many lifeforrns? We will - we must - find out!

After you are out of the Hades you will be Attacked. It is useful to use
a better weapon against the attackers (e.g. grenades is you have them).

- Go to the Bar, buy a beer and ask Dethmaker about the Attack.
  He will give you a Keycard
- Go out of the town (marked with 'EXIT'). On your left you see a ladder.
  Go down the ladder and go right to the door. Go through the door and
  go right again until you reach the next door. As you have the Keycard,
  you are able to pass this door.

  It is useful to have a plasma gun to fight the members of the gang.

 MIGHT AND MAGIC II
       Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 The purpose of this walkthru is to provide you with information about MIGHT AND
MAGIC II, a computer role-playing game from New World Computing. When you play
the game, you assume the identity of some of the characters in the game.
Characters that you create will be referred to as "player-characters." You can
control some characters that are provided with the game; they are called
"hirelings." Any game characters that are not under your control may be referred
to as "monsters" (regardless of what they actually are).

 Player-characters begin the game young, impoverished, ignorant, inexperienced,
and relatively weak. One major game objective is to improve the stats and
conditions of your player-characters. In MMII, you accomplish this by
adventuring in the land of Cron, guiding your characters as they fight monsters
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-9448

and solve puzzles.

 There are several sections to this walkthru. I have tried to arrange them in
such a way that you could use portions of the walkthru to help you without
giving away the whole game.

 The first three parts of the walkthru contain general information to help you
get started and to refer to along the way.

 Part 4 describes various combat options and strategies, resting, and casting
spells. Part 5 describes the outdoor regions and time travel. Towns of Cron,
with a short discussion about the features of Cron in the past, are discussed in
Part 6. Part 7 is similar, providing general descriptions of the dungeons,
caves, caverns, strongholds, and towers in Cron.

 Part 8, "The Cron Gazetteer," lists exact locations for many of the features
discussed in "The Travel Guide" and the "Guide to the Underground." If you are
interested in finding these things by yourself, don't read this part.

 Part 9 describes a procedure I discovered that may allow you to raise a 6th
 !CompuServe TEG-9450

level party to 50th level in less than two hours of game play. Also, the
Interleaves, the coded messages, the translated messages, and a few words of the
Preamble are listed here. I am uneasy about including these things, as they
might compromise the playability of the game (invincibility quickly becomes
boring), but if you use the advice in smaller doses, it may make the game more
enjoyable for you. Remember, you were warned!

 Because I gained much of the information in this walkthru empirically by taking
notes as I played, some of it might not match exactly with your findings. For
example, a fountain that produces random changes in a character's attributes
will probably affect your characters differently than it did mine.

 Any mistakes in this text are mine alone! If you find any, I would be
interested in hearing about them!

 OBJECT OF THE GAME

 Cron (where your characters live) is in danger. One of the major causes is the
death of Kalohn, the first and last King of Cron, in the early years of the 8th
era (a/k/a 9th century, the years 800-899).
 !CompuServe TEG-9452


 Your characters live in the early years of the 9th era. The forces of evil are
becoming stronger. Legends, portents, soothsayers, and nightmares indicate that
Cron will soon be destroyed. If someone doesn't do something, the world will
come to an end. That's where you come in.

 MAJOR OBJECTIVES

 If you don't save Cron, no one will. To do this, you will have to change
history by helping King Kalohn win his final battle. Once you save King Kalohn's
life, he will give you a final quest. The fate of Cron rests solely on your
broad shoulders!

 MINOR OBJECTIVES

 You need great knowledge, great personal power, and the assistance of powerful
artifacts to aid the King. Your exploration of the Land of Cron will bring you
power and knowledge and lead you to the artifacts you need. Along the way you
should try and accomplish certain tasks. Among these are:

 !CompuServe TEG-9454

 1. Fulfill the lesser quests bestowed on you by the more powerful residents of
Cron; increase the strength and wealth of your characters; collect magic items
and ancient artifacts.

 2. Learn how to travel through time (there are at least two ways to do this).

 3. Discover what items King Kalohn needs to win his final battle, collect them,
and deliver them to the King (just in time)! Aiding strangers in peril may prove
rewarding, perhaps gaining you a friend, a valuable item as a reward, or a
willing companion-in-peril.

 4. Explore all, overlook nothing, and keep meticulous records! Decipher the
messages, solve the mysteries, and destroy evil wherever you find it (unless you
yourself are evil, in which case just destroy anything you want!).

 CREATING CHARACTERS

 Creating characters is fun, and important as well. Care in the creation of your
characters will make your early adventuring more interesting and enjoyable.

CompuServe TEG-9456

 ATTRIBUTE SCORES

 A brand new character is defined by his computer-generated scores in seven
attributes, such as strength, speed, IQ, etc. The attribute scores range from 3
to 21.

 CHARACTER TYPES

 There are eight professions, or "character types" available to MMII
player-characters, depending on the attribute scores of each character. For
example, the profession of Knight requires high Strength.

 In MMII you build a character from the original seven attribute scores,
swapping them between attributes until you are satisfied. As you swap
attributes, the computer will tell you for which professions the current
character is qualified. If no combination of the present scores interests you,
just press <ENTER>, and a new set is available.

 Look for sets of scores with only one less then 10 and at least two above 16
(my personal recommendation). Don't wait for Superman; you can increase a
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9457

character's attributes during the game.

 Below are some guidelines for distributing attribute scores:

 1. Use the highest score for endurance. Endurance helps determine how many hit
points a character starts with, and how many are gained as each new level of
experience is earned. Poor endurance leads to early deaths (and costly
resurrections).

 2. Allocate a high score to speed. For low levels characters, a high score in
speed can significantly increase armor class, but there is an even better reason
to be fast. In many confrontations, the slower party will be wiped out before
they can even act. Try to make sure that you are not the slower party!

 Now allocate the rest of your scores, depending on what type of character you
are trying to create.

 CONSIDERATIONS WHEN CREATING CHARACTERS

 A party of adventures in MMII is limited to eight characters, with a maximum of
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9459

six player characters. Hirelings may be used to fill out the roster; however,
you aren't forced to use eight characters. You may wish to try your luck with
only one. Also, if you like, your party could consist entirely of hirelings,
although they will have trouble buying and selling things, visiting Murray, and
even resting! When you are just starting out, you should try and take as many
character types as possible, because most of them have some non-overlapping
skills (I feel Ninjas and Barbarians are redundant and almost never use them).
As your characters begin to advance, you may decide you can do without certain
character types in your party; then, you can substitute other characters.

 For a low level party, I recommend (in this marching order): Knight, Paladin,
Thief, Cleric, Sorcerer, and Archer. My feeling is that the character in
position 3 gets hit more often than the one in position 4, although I don't have
stats to prove it.

 With higher-level characters (say above 25th level), I generally use the
following party: Paladin, Paladin, Paladin (Sherman), Cleric, Archer, Archer,
Sorcerer, and Sorcerer (Mr. Wizard).

 I find with high-level opponents that a Paladin's ability to throw spells makes
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9461

him more useful than a Knight (although there is a high-level Knight resting in
the Middlegate Inn just in case).

 I don't use a Robber any more. I found a trick that lets me use an Archer to do
the Robber's jobs (open doors, disarm traps) safely (see Part 3), and I use the
Archer in position 5 to act as a Robber. Stick around for the hints section to
see how to do this!

 CUSTOMIZING YOUR CHARACTERS

 Once you have finished adjusting attribute scores, you get to choose several
more characteristics for your characters: Profession, Race, Sex, Alignment, and
Name. During much of the game, none of these characteristics will matter, but
there are situations that can make any of these important. For example, there
are places where males can't go that females can, where elves are not welcome,
and places where evil is not tolerated. Make sure you are prepared for these
situations by rolling a wide range of characters and using them occasionally.

 EQUIPPING YOUR CHARACTERS

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9463

 Early in the game, your prime goal should be to increase the armor class of
your characters. Buy the best armor you can, and equip the front row first; when
you find or buy better armor, let the old armor filter back to the characters in
rows 2 and 3. When you get better armor for them, transfer their old armor
toward the back of the party (if the other characters can use it).

 Your party can buy and sell armor and weapons at the local Blacksmith Shop.
Blacksmiths (and most other merchants in the game) will not deal with hirelings,
so your player-characters will have to buy and sell for them.

 If one member of your party has the secondary skill of "Merchant," you will get
better prices whenever you deal with a blacksmith (or any other merchant).

 ARMOR

 Most character classes are limited in the types of armor they can use. Not all
character types are allowed to use shields or helmets. Listed below are the
types of (non-magical) armor in order of protection (from best to worst), and
the character types that can use each type. The character types are shown next
to the best armor they can wear; each type can wear any of the armor listed on
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9465

lower lines.

 A letter after a character type indicates whether that type can use a helmet
(H), shield (S), or both (B). Archers, Ninjas, and Sorcerers are not allowed to
use either helmets or shields.

 Plate Armor - Knights (B), Paladins (B)
 Plate Mail
 Splint Armor - Clerics (B)
 Chain Mail - Archer, Robber (S)
 Ring Mail - Ninja
 Scale Mail - Barbarian (B)
 Leather Suit
 Padded Armor - Sorcerer

 WEAPONS

 MIGHT AND MAGIC II recognizes two classes of personal weapons: missile weapons
and hand-held weapons. A missile weapon has two parts, a launcher (bow, sling,
blowgun) and an expendable missile (arrow, stone, quarrel, dart). You are not
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9467

allowed to throw weapons (e.g., a spear is not a missile weapon).

 There are two categories of hand-held weapons: one-handed and two-handed
weapons. Two-handed weapons generally do more damage than one-handed weapons,
but characters equipped with shields can't use two-handed weapons.

 Classes that can't use shields (Archer, Ninja, Sorcerer) should use the best
two-handed weapons they can get. Robbers cannot use two-handed weapons, so they
should carry a shield.

 For the other classes (Knight, Paladin, Cleric, and Barbarian) you have to make
a choice between the additional damage done by a two-hand weapon and the
additional protection offered by a shield.

 TOOLS

 Low-level characters should carry some tools. Often a tool can be substituted
for a spell or ability that low-level characters haven't developed yet. For
example, a Thief's Pick will enhance your Robber's chances to safely open locks
and disarm traps, in effect allowing him to operate as a higher-level Robber.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9468


 THE INN

 Newly created player-characters begin the game in the Middlegate Inn, in
Middlegate Town. New characters are almost broke and always need to buy
equipment. Fortunately, there is no charge for staying at the Inn.

 When you select "Go To Town" from the options menu, the guest book from the
Middlegate Inn will be displayed. To begin an adventure, you must select a party
of characters and leave the Inn.

 No game time passes when all your characters and hirelings are guests at an
Inn. Characters and hirelings leave the Inn with the same status as when they
checked in (no changes in equipment, age, or health). If you are unable to help
a sick, injured, dead, or eradicated party member, leave that character at any
Inn until you are able to help.

 Saving the game is done by staying at any of the Inns. If your entire active
party dies during game play, your party will revert to the status it had the
last time you entered an Inn. When you are playing with low-level characters,
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9470

you should save the game often. This may seem like a waste of time, but if you
don't do it, you may waste hours redoing parts of the game!

 KEEPING A "BANKER"

 Many players (including me) like to create one or more characters strictly to
use as "bankers." Bankers are characters that rarely leave the Inn and almost
never go on expeditions. Instead, when a party returns from an expedition,
portions of the treasure are transferred to the banker for future use.

 OVERALL GAME PLAN

 While there is no single correct way to play the game, if you are interested in
winning, this section will provide you with a general game plan. If you find the
play more interesting than the winning (as I do), the game plan isn't important;
sooner or later you will have accomplished all the goals anyway, and when you
decide to win, you should be ready to do so.

 STARTING OUT

 Create good characters, but don't be a fanatic about it since you can improve
them later. Equip them as quickly as you can. Make increasing their Armor Class
your highest priority. You should stay in Middlegate until you start to feel
it's too "small town" for you.
 !CompuServe TEG-9473


 LEARN MAP MAKING!

 Find the Cartographer and learn Cartography. This will allow you to map the
areas you visit. To examine the map, press the "M" key.

 EARLY QUESTS

 Once you have reached 3rd or 4th level, perform the mini-quests that Nordon and
Nordonna ask you to do for them. This will gain you valuable experience, help
you get a useful spell, and provide you with another mini-quest which will make
the game easier to play for as long as you wish to play. (For exact details, see
Note 1.)

 BUILDING STRONG MINDS IN STRONG BODIES

 You should be ready to start exploring more of Cron by this time. Before you
venture out, members of your party should be learned in the skills of mountain
climbing and path finding (both skills available in Middlegate), and they should
also be trained in the skills of Crusader and Navigator (available in Tundara).
 !CompuServe TEG-9475


 LOCAL EXPLORATION

 Middlegate is in Region C2, which has some interesting features. Thorough
exploration of this area should help you obtain another useful spell (or two, if
you decide to investigate the cave), and provide you with some information to
puzzle over as you continue to play.

 The first time you leave Middlegate through the town gates, you will be greeted
by a being who claims to be your guardian Pegasus. Pay attention to his words
because he can provide you with a yearly income of 100,000 gold, if you learn
his name and find out where he lives. The skill of Linguist is useful in
learning his name (details in Note 2).

 OTHER TOWNS AND CAVERNS

 Explore the other towns and the caverns beneath them. Take detailed notes of
the things you find, especially the clues scattered here and there.

 You will find clues that describe the Red, Yellow, and Green Interleaves; make
 !CompuServe TEG-9477

sure to note these. As you explore Cron you will come upon signs that say things
like "Yellow Message 1"; note all these messages, and when you have them all,
use the Interleaves to decipher the Red, Yellow, and Green Messages.

 The Messages will provide you with more information on your actual mission in
life (if you decide to accept it): saving Cron.

 Just as a reference, the locations of the Messages and Interleaves may be found
in "The Cron Gazetter" (Part 8).

 There is no reason to hurry at this point; Cron will last long enough for you
to save it. Tour the country, see the sites, earn more experience, and collect
more treasure.

 If you have the Clerical Spell C 2-3 (Nature's Gate) by Nature's Day, good. But
if you don't, don't worry because Nature's Day comes once a year.

 GETTING INTO GEAR

 Along about 7th or 8th level, you should start paying a little more attention
 !CompuServe TEG-9478

to Cron's future (if you want). Start visiting the castles, and take on a few of
the Quests you are offered. Visit Pinehurst and help Peabody find his lost pet.
This gets you access to the "WayBack Machine." Go back to the 8th Era and visit
Castle Xabran. Learn where to find spells and hirelings. During one of these
visits to Xabran, retrieve the valuable magic items that are stored there (see
Note 3).

 Some time along the way, win a Triple Crown of each color, and purchase a key
of each color.

 Each of your characters should complete a Jurors' Quest (maybe take some
hirelings along as well). Although they seem very difficult and dangerous, with
a little planning you can accomplish them with level 12 characters.

 Once your party has completed its Jurors' Quests and won a Black Triple Crown,
go to Luxus Palace Royale for an audience with Queen Lamanda. She will reward
you and provide you with a new mission.

 If you have explored enough, you have probably encountered the ranting wild man
who loves Cupie Dolls. If you take him a Cupie Doll, you might be surprised as
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9480

he helps you to become a better person. This isn't absolutely necessary, but the
better your attributes are, the longer you will live.

 THE ORB

 By now, you should have some idea of the magic items that you need in order to
win the game. In order to get the Orb, you will need to find some ancient items
with funny, hi-tech-sounding names, and use them to actually take possession of
the Orb (see Note 4). Then, you will encounter a problem that baffles almost
everyone who plays the game: How the heck do I get it home?

 Well, do some brainstorming, check out your hirelings and their capabilities,
and don't dismiss any ideas that sound useful (see Note 5).

 WHAT ELSE DO I NEED?

 Isn't that enough? No, you're right: it really isn't enough. You need four more
magical talismans, and to get them, you have to give up four that you already
have. These new talismans can only be found in the various Elemental Planes; so,
now you need to learn the spells that let you enter these Planes and continue to
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9482

live. Good Luck!

 Finally, you have all of the wondrous magic items you need to help the king. So
now it's time to....

 SAVE THE WORLD

 Find the King before he gets toasted by the Mega-Dragon, and give him the magic
items you worked so hard to collect. For a short time he will be too busy to
thank you, but once he defeats MagillaBreath, you can return to current-day
Cron, where King Kalohn and Queen Lamanda will greet you as Saviors of the World
and Heroes of the Realm, won't they?

 Sure they will, and the "check's in the mail!" No, you have one more mission to
perform. Return to Square Lake, use the secret password to enter the Square Lake
Cave, battle your way through the endless corridors, slaughtering countless
monsters, until you reach the door guarded by 666 Devil Kings. Don't fight them
or you'll lose and have to do it over again!

 Once you've passed all of these obstacles and reached your destination, you
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9484

will be invited to solve a cryptogram. The encryption scheme used for this
puzzle is simple: Each letter in the encoded document represents an unencoded
letter in the original, in a 1-to-1 correspondence.

 You have a time limit, though; the "End of All" is approaching. If you don't
solve the puzzle soon, Cron blows up, you'll need to return to the Inn, and try
again. The same message will be encoded, but the encryption scheme is changed;
the answers you have from your last try aren't valid, so you have to start over.
(Depending on your computer, there may be a way to "cheat" here. See Note 6.)

 Once you have the code, you have to encode something in the same code you just
deciphered and then, finally....

 You win!

 QUEST NOTES

 If you want to figure things out for yourself, don't read these!

 NOTE 1

CompuServe TEG-9486


 Nordonna suggests that you use the Portals to visit each town, and while you
are in a town, to visit the Temple in that town and make a Donation.

 Actually the order doesn't matter, but you do need to use the portals. Once you
have donated at the fifth Temple, you will find an iron coin. Throwing this iron
coin into a specific fountain will allow you to find a Castle Key.

 The Castle Key will allow you to go into the various castles in Cron without
having to kill the Castle Guards every time you drop by.

 NOTE 2

 You can learn Meenu's name in C3. He hangs out at B1 (9,9). The only direction
you can approach him from without magic is the north.

 NOTE 3

 The magic items you need to retrieve from Xabran are the Air, Earth, Fire, and
Water Discs. You later take these to the respective Elemental Planes, where you

exchange them for the 4 Talons (again Air, Earth, Fire, and Water).

 NOTE 4

 In order to pick up the Orb from its current resting place in Dawn's Mist Bog
Resort, you need to have the A-1 Todilor, J-26 Fluxor, M-27 Radicon, and N-19
Capitor with you. These must be carried by the party member in position 1.

 Computers that run PC-DOS or MS-DOS have a "Pause" or "Hold" button, which,
essentially, stops the computer until you press it again. I pressed this button
and worked out the cryptogram. The first time I typed in the answer, I made a
typo; so, I paused again until I was sure it was right before reentering it. (It
was right and extremely anti-climactic.)

 MIGHT AND MAGIC II
       Part 3

 IMPROVING YOUR CHARACTERS

 In order to win MIGHT AND MAGIC II, your characters should be about 35th level;
however, it takes lots of combat to raise your characters this high. In order to
speed this process up a little, here are some ways of getting experience that
involve little or no combat. I call this "free" or "cheap" experience, even
though it may be expensive in terms of gold.

 FREE EXPERIENCE

 There are two sources of experience that require absolutely no combat: the
hermit Mark in C1, and the Gourmet in A3.

 Mark has lost his keys. He will reward your party with 10,000 experience points
 !CompuServe TEG-9491

for their return (visiting Mark without his keys may be deadly).

 The Death Spider in A2 has found Mark's keys. If you answer her riddle
correctly, she will give you the keys. If you answer incorrectly, not only will
she keep the keys, she will attack you.

 The Gourmet will discuss food with another gourmet, and after the discussion,
awards the other gourmet 100,000 points. In order to become a gourmet, a
character must sample all of the meals available in all of the Taverns of Cron.

 These experience points cost you gold, and eating all of those meals may have
unpleasant repercussions in the future; however, the experience points are
gained without combat.

 CHEAP EXPERIENCE

 The minimal fighting involved in gaining Cheap Experience may be avoided
altogether if you're clever.

 The four Bishops of Battle are imprisoned in the four castles of Cron, and they
 !CompuServe TEG-9493

will reward your party with experience if you are able to free them. The amount
of experience depends on the color of the Bishop you release.

 You will need colored keys to release these Bishops, and you will have to
explore the castles to find each prison. You may have to fight some castle
guards to actually get to the prisons, or you may be able to avoid the guards.
If you happen to have won a Triple Crown of the same color as the Bishop, he
will reward you even more highly.

 Lord Slayer (Castle HillStone, D4) and Lord Hoardall (Castle Woodhaven, C1)
have a number of minor quests they would like your party to perform (the Lords'
quests are not minor).

 These quests require that you either kill a specific type of monster (for Lord
Slayer), or that you return with a specific item (Lord Hoardall). They are
included as "cheap experience" because you can complete them one at a time as
part of your normal activities, without going out of your way. After you have
completed one of these quests successfully, the grateful Lord will provide your
party with experience.

 !CompuServe TEG-9496

 There are a number of ways to gain experience that allow you to accurately
estimate your chances of success before taking any risk.

 The Battle Arenas: Middlegate, Sandsobar, and Atlantium have battle arenas,
where you can arrange to fight for a reward. You will always fight the same
number of opponents as you have party members, and you have some influence over
the strength of the opponents you will face.

 Tickets are available in most blacksmiths, and the color of the ticket and the
Arena you use it in will determine how tough your opponents will be. The
Colosseum in Atlantium provides the most dangerous monsters, but balances the
greater risk with greater rewards!

 Lord Haart's Quest: Lord Haart, who maintains a castle in B2, would like you to
visit the past and recover two family heirlooms: Spaz Twit's Phaser, and the
Long One's +7 Loincloth. If you know where Spaz and the Long One hang out in
their respective centuries, this is a relatively easy quest.

 The Triple Crowns: If you win a red-ticket combat in each of the three battle
arenas, you will win a Red Triple Crown. Winning a Black Triple Crown is
 !CompuServe TEG-9498

necessary to win the game. When you free a Bishop of Battle, his rewards will be
greater if you have won a Triple Crown of his color.

 The Lords' Quest: When Lord Slayer and Lord Hoardall send you on quests, you
may select the Lords' Quest. Lord Slayer wants you to defeat the Envoys of Evil,
while Lord Hoardall wants you to collect the three Ancient Swords. These Quests
are definitely dangerous, but they will reward you well.

 The Jurors' Quests: Before you can win the game, each of your characters will
need to complete a Jurors' Quest. There are clues to the Jurors' Quests in
Atlantium, and you can actually listen to the Jurors on Farview Mountain, in D2.

 Once your characters have completed their Jurors' Quests and won a Black Triple
Crown, visit the Queen in Luxus Palace Royale and she will reward you.

 DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE

 The most dangerous outdoor square on the map is E2; however, some of the best
treasures and the most experience can be gained by winning fights in E2. Nothing
in E2 ever falls under the free, cheap, or limited risk categories of
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9500

experience. If you venture here, you will get at least as much danger as you
bargained for!

 Among the toughest monsters in Cron are the Cuisinarts (B2). While you won't be
able to beat them for a long time, once you do beat them, you will gain a lot of
experience very quickly. Don't forget to search afterwards: Some of the best
treasure in the game turns up here!

 Perhaps the most dangerous Dungeon is the Dragons' Dominion (D1); there are 100
dragons there, with treasure and experience to match. The Ancient Dragon who
rules the Dragons' Dominion guards one of the single best rewards in the game!

 ENHANCING ATTRIBUTES

 Your characters are not forever restricted to the attributes you rolled for
them when they were created. MMII provides several ways of raising the various
attributes.

 In most of the dungeons, caves, and caverns throughout Cron, there are ways to
enhance your attribute scores permanently (unlike a fountain or a potion, whose
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9501

effects vanish shortly). There are generally two ways in each dungeon to change
your attributes: an attribute modifier, which trades points in one attribute for
points in another; an attribute enhancer, which raises your score in a selected
attribute.

 Usually the description of the attribute-changing device (often a fountain)
will contain a clue to the effects of the device, although it may be difficult
to decipher the clue until after you have tested the device. For example, a clue
that says "Slow but steady wins the race" might indicate that the device will
lower your speed but raise your endurance.

 Many of the devices for changing attributes will not work on all of the races
or classes of player-characters. For instance, a device that trades IQ for
Personality might not work on Half-Orcs.

 There is usually an upper limit on the effects of these devices. For instance,
there is an Intelligence Enhancer under Atlantium, which will increase your
intelligence to a maximum of 50 points. The effects of these devices are only
noticed after you rest. Many of them will work on you several times, until your
attribute has reached the maximum for that device.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9503


 THE CIRCUS

 Visit the Circus and play some of the Carnival games! Normally all you win is a
Cupie Doll, but that Cupie Doll can help you become a better person! Somewhere
in Cron is a crazy old coot who loves Cupie Dolls, and gives away rewards that
are all out of proportion to his present! Give him a Cupie Doll and follow his
directions, and you can start on your way to raising all of your attributes to
levels even some deities can't reach! Remember that changes to your attributes
are not apparent until after you rest.

 You can visit the circus as often as you like (until they leave for the year).

 IMPROVING ATTRIBUTES WITH MAGIC

 There seems to be no permanent way to raise attribute scores over 100; however,
there are a number of magical ways to temporarily raise your attributes.

 The Greatest Fountain (E2) will raise all your attributes to 200 until you rest
or finish one battle, whichever comes first.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9505


 There are a number of potions and magic items that can also increase your
attributes. Most potions lose effect after one battle or rest. Magic items, on
the other hand, affect you as long as you are equipped with them.

 Many types of arms and armor increase your strength (apparently, there are some
versions of the game where this particular function doesn't work). There are
weapons that will increase your other attributes. Examples are: Speed (Fast
Cutlass), Personality (Holy Cudgel), Intelligence (Genius Staff), Luck (Chance
Sword), and Accuracy (True Axe). The greater the magical bonus of these weapons,
the higher they will raise your attribute score.

 Using items, it is possible to raise your attributes to above 200 points, but
you should be careful _not_ to go above 254 points; the Rest function doesn't
seem to be able to deal with attributes of 255 and up. (On my system, the
program locks up and I have to reboot.)

 There may be some kind of curse associated with using items and magic to raise
your attributes. There have been occasions when my characters used an artifact
to raise an attribute (usually Intelligence), and when they removed that
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9507

artifact, the attribute was lower than when they started (occasionally dropping
to 0!). I have never determined for certain why this happens. It may be helpful
to have your Clerics cast C 9-4 (Uncurse Item) on the things your party carries.

 IMPROVING HIT POINTS

 In the section on Creating Characters, endurance was mentioned as being the
most important attribute. This is because endurance and level determine the
number of hit points a character can take. You never have enough hit points, but
there are several ways to increase your hit points.

 Always train at the most expensive Training Center you can afford. The more
expensive the place is, the more hit points you will get when you go up a level.
The best Training Center is in Atlantium.

 Many caves, dungeons, and caverns provide ways to increase hit points. This may
be done by drinking from a fountain, pulling a lever, or listening to a song.

 There are two extremely potent ways to increase your hit points. Both are
effective only once in the life of a character, and both are very difficult to
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9509

find.

 In one of the dungeons below a palace, there is a Hit Point Salesman. If you
can find him and meet his price, he will raise your hit points to their
theoretical maximum.

 In the Dragons' Dominion, one of the Ancient Dragons guards an artifact that
increases hit points by 1000.

 There are a number of magic fountains that will affect your characters' hit
points, but they are not all good. For example, a fountain that sets each
character's hit points to 75 is nice for low-level characters, but not so great
if your party averages 200 hit points each. Whenever you drink from a magic
fountain, be sure and check the status of your players!

 There is a potion called "MaxHP Potion." One of the Blacksmiths will sell you a
2-use MaxHP Potion; you can sometimes find a 200-use "MaxHP Potion" in
treasures. This potion temporarily increases your allowed maximum number of hit
points.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9511

 To make use of this potion, your characters should take it immediately after
they rest, and then a Paladin or Cleric should cast C 1-6 Power Cure on each
party member that used the potion, temporarily raising their hit points. This
potion is particularly useful when the party is outdoors, and the Clerics and
Paladins can cast C 7-3 (Moon Ray), as the party may actually be able to gain
hit points as the combat progresses!

 THIEVERY

 I promised you a way to use some other type of character in place of a Robber,
so here it is!

 A Looter's Knife and a Pirate's Crossbow both enhance a character's ability as
a thief, and both may be used by classes other than Thieves and Ninjas. Thus,
when an Archer is equipped with a Pirate's Crossbow, he may function as a Thief.
The higher the magical bonus of the weapon, the better the character will do as
a Robber.

 More importantly, when a character who is equipped with one of these weapons
advances a level in a Training Center, his natural ability as a Robber increases
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9513

by one-percent. From now on, each time this character advances, this ability
goes up just as if he was born a Robber.

 A 35th level Archer who started to learn Thievery when he was 7th level would
have the natural ability of Thievery 28-percent. If he is equipped with a
Pirate's Crossbow +15 and a Looter's Knife +17, his ability will be Thievery
60-percent. He isn't a spectacularly successful Robber, but he's good enough
that you can now afford to leave your Robber at home, and replace him with a
more powerful character.

 This process works as well with other character types; I just chose the Archer
because that is the character type I prefer.

 MIGHT AND MAGIC II
       Part 4

 Much of your time in Cron is spent adventuring, exp


loring new and dangerous
places or revisiting familiar, but still dangerous places. This section contains
hints that may help 
you survive some of these dangers.

 COMBAT AND OPTIONS

 Most of your interaction with the characters that are part of the 

game (called
"monsters," but this might also include creatures very similar to men) occurs
either just before a combat, or during the course of a combat.

 The display will tell you when you have encountered monsters. The next message
(if necessary) will tell you if you surprised the monsters or if they surprised
you. If there is surprise, you will have to press the spacebar 
to continue. If
you surprised the monsters or if there is no surprise, you will have to decide
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-9656

what you wish to do next. If the monsters surprised you, your only choice is to
fight.

 When your party encounters a monster or monsters, your options are Attack,
Bribe, Hide, or Run.

 HIDE: I have never successfully used the Hide option; it probably works best if
you have surprise on your side.

 RUN: If successful, your party is transported to a safe square somewhere on the
current map. If you run from a creature (instead of a random, wandering
monster), there will still be monsters in the square you ran from when you
return, although they may be different monsters.

 BRIBE: The art of bribery is extremely valuable in Cron. It may help you avoid
encounters that would be fatal otherwise. Vary bribes to suit the types of
monsters you encounter. Man-like creatures usually prefer gold; less intelligent
animals may be bribed with food; some spellcasting monsters will accept gems.

 Any frenzied monster (specifically "Crazed Natives") might be considered a
 !CompuServe TEG-9668

non-intelligent animal; you might try a bribe of 100 units of food (don't fight
Crazed Natives unless you have no other option).

 A group of monsters may accept a bribe in some circumstances and reject it in
others. For instance, you can often bribe Castle Guards at a Castle Gate to let
you in, but you will have a much harder time trying to bribe the same number of
Castle Guards who encounter you in the Castle's Treasury.

 Bribed monsters go away and take their treasure with them.

 ATTACK: This means what it says: Engage the monsters in combat to the death!

 ORDER OF COMBAT

 The order of combat is determined mostly by the respective speed of the
opponents, with modifiers for marching order and surprise. When you face a party
with several different types of monster in it, some may go before some of your
characters and some afterwards, with some acting in the middle of the sequence.
Often when the monsters get to go first, combat is over before you ever get to
take a swing. This is why you should concentrate on making your party faster!
 !CompuServe TEG-9691


 The combat options available to characters are Attack, Fight, Shoot, Cast,
Block, Run, Exchange, and View.

 Some of these actions can be taken without ending the character's turn, such as
"V" for view (allows you to check the current character status display) and "Q"
which checks the Quick Reference display.

 Other actions produce some effect (or fail) after which it is someone else's
turn. Non-violent actions are Block, Exchange, and Run.

 BLOCK increases a character's Armor Class only until the end of the combat
round in which it is used. Block is of little value to a character who goes
last!

 RUN may allow a character to withdraw from combat. The character will not
rejoin the party until combat is finished. When unconscious party members are
abandoned because other party members choose to run, the enemy slits their
throats. Sometimes a character is unable to run successfully, leaving him unable
to take any other action until the next round.
 !CompuServe TEG-9704


 EXCHANGE lets a character swap positions with another character in the marching
order. This may be done to move a wounded character out of harm's way, move a
dead character to the back to let someone else fight, or to allow a character
with no missile weapons to use his hand-held weapon instead.

 USE allows you to try to use the special power of any item your character is
equipped with or carrying in his pack. If an item's special power cannot be used
in combat, the character gets to select another option.

 SHOOT allows a character to use his missile weapon against the opponents.
Archers can always shoot during any combat round, even if they are engaged in
hand-to-hand combat. Other classes can only shoot if they are _not_ engaged in
hand-to-hand combat.

 CAST allows the character to use a combat spell. Any spellcaster can attempt to
throw a spell at any time, regardless of his current combat status (in other
words, a spellcaster engaged in hand-to-hand combat may still use his spells).

 ATTACK/FIGHT: These are essentially the same option, except Attack
 !CompuServe TEG-9706

automatically hits the monster in the front of the enemy party, while Fight
allows you to pick your target. Only a character engaged in hand-to-hand combat
is allowed to select these options, and the target must also be engaged in
hand-to-hand combat.

 During a fight, some of the monsters may decide to run away. Occasionally, all
of the monsters may run away before you kill any of them. If this happens, you
will get no experience and no treasure for that fight.

 It also seems as if monsters can go for reinforcements. Sometimes a message
will be displayed reading, "Monster adds Friends," and suddenly, there are twice
as many monsters.

 The S 6-2 spell (Entrapment) prevents monsters from running away from a combat.
I don't know if this prevents monsters from "Adding Friends."

 COMBAT HINTS

 The "Rule Of Ten": In most cases, only the ten monsters closest to your party
are able to hit you in a given combat round. The others can't reach you, even if
 !CompuServe TEG-9708

you kill the first ten. This may be because they are having trouble climbing
over their casualties in order to reach you. This is useful if you face lots of
opponents who could potentially beat you, but you get to go first in combat. As
long you can kill the front ten monsters in any single round, you will take _no_
damage. While this may seem unrealistic, you will come to appreciate it before
very long!

 There are exceptions to the Rule of Ten, and they are extremely dangerous!
Monsters in the back row don't seem to have trouble climbing over their buddies
who have self-destructed during their attack (Crazed Natives or Carnage Spirits,
for example). With a little bad luck, all 100 members of a party of Mad Peasants
might be able to hit you in the same combat round. As you learn what monsters
are exceptions to this rule, you will learn to avoid them!

 Monsters designed specifically for combat (Warbots) also seem to be exceptions
to this rule. Some powerful spellcasting monsters (like Wizards) seem to be able
to cast spells regardless of any carnage surrounding them.

 When you are fighting outdoors, one of the most useful spells is C 7-3 (Moon
Ray). Moon Ray hurts the enemy and heals your party at the same time. Some magic
 !CompuServe TEG-9710

items are able to create Moon Rays. Putting these items into the pack of party
members who can't use Clerical Spells provides you with insurance in case your
Clerics and Paladins go down first!

 You are often faced with the choice of concentrating your attack on one
monster, or spreading your attacks around among all monsters. If there is one
monster (or only a few monsters that are clearly more dangerous), you should
concentrate on it first. For example, if you encounter a Tyrannosaurus Rex
accompanied by ten Kobolds, you should worry about T'Rex first!

 Characters do not usually die as a direct result of hand-to-hand combat. When a
character's hit points reach zero, he falls unconscious, and most opponents will
leave the unconscious bodies alone until none of your party is still standing.
If you have healing spells, an unconscious character may be able to return to
combat the next round. A character with one hit point hits just as hard as a
character with 200 hit points, so try and keep everybody in action!

 There are always some exceptions: Monsters in a frenzy will hit anything, even
unconscious bodies, and the Mega-Dragon eradicates a character whenever he hits.
The C 7-4 spell (Raise Dead) can be thrown during combat, but C 9-3 (Resurrect)
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9712

can't; so, dead characters may sometimes be returned quickly to combat, while
eradicated characters have to wait until a fight is over.

 If you are facing opponents with area damage spells or breath weapons, try to
make sure none of your characters is unconscious when these spells or weapons
are used. One point of damage will kill an unconscious character, while 100 or
even 1,000 points of physical damage done to a character with one hit point will
usually only render him unconscious.

 SEARCHING FOR TREASURE

 You can search for treasure immediately after combat is over, but if your party
is badly damaged, you should take time to heal before you open the treasure.
Most treasures are trapped, and if the trap is sprung, any member of your party
who was unconscious is now dead. Most treasures are worth the delay.

 There is no need to throw a Detect Traps spell on a treasure; it doesn't
actually help you disarm the trap, and it wastes spell points. If you leave a
square with treasure in it without searching for that treasure, it will be gone
when you return.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9714


 RESTING

 About once in 20 rest periods, you will be attacked while you are asleep. There
is no way to leave a guard awake, so your party is always surprised if attacked
during a rest.

 Low-level parties are usually wiped out if they are attacked while asleep.
Monsters are much more careful around high-level parties; sometimes when they
realize who it is that they tripped over, they all run away before you wake up
(who says you don't get no respect?). To me, this one situation makes the game
worth playing; I've always wanted to be so powerful that people were afraid to
wake me up!

 Spells S 1-1 (Awaken) and C 1-2 (Awaken) are useful if your spellcasters wake
up before the rest of your party. There is also a magic item (the Wakeup Horn)
which will wake your party. Unfortunately, if the character with the horn is
asleep, he can't use it!

 Spell S 6-? (Shelter) and the Magic Item Instant Keep will both grant your
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9716

party an undisturbed rest period, during which your wounds will heal; however,
used spell points don't regenerate during this rest.

 CASTING SPELLS

 There are two types of spells: Sorcerer Spells and Clerical Spells. Sorcerers
and Archers can cast Sorcerer Spells, and Clerics and Paladins can cast clerical
Spells.

 Spells are often referred to in a type of shorthand, using the letter "S" for
sorcerer Spells and "C" for Clerical Spells, followed by numbers indicating
spell level and spell number. So, "C 7-4" refers to the seventh level Clerical
spell Raise Dead; "S 4-6" refers to the fourth level Sorcerer spell Time
Distortion.

 Each spellcaster always carries a spell book, and all the spells that he knows
are listed in the book. When your party is not in combat, you can examine each
character's spell book by selecting the character and then pressing "C" as if to
throw a spell. Press ESC to abort a spell. To examine a character's spell book
in combat, use the "V" command to view that character's record sheet, then use
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9740

"V" again to examine the character's spell book.

 First level Clerics and Sorcerers start the game knowing some spells. They
probably learned these spells during their apprenticeship, which presumably
occurred before the start of the game. Whenever a character learns a new spell,
it is automatically added to his spell book. There are three ways to learn
spells:

 1. Each time a spellcaster attains a new spell level, certain spells are taught
to him at the Training Center. However, the Training Centers never teach all the
spells of a certain level.

 2. Some of the spells the Training Centers don't teach may be purchased at the
Sorcerers' Guild or Temple in each town.

 3. There are some spells that you can't learn in any of the towns. You must
find these spells scattered throughout Cron.

 Many hirelings can throw spells. Some hirelings (notably Mr. Wizard) know all
of their own type of spells. They can't teach your characters any spells, but by
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9742

adding them to your party you can benefit from their knowledge.

 There is a Spell Salesman on the second level of one of the dungeons, who will
teach your party every spell that is available to player-characters.

 SPELL POINTS

 A spellcaster has an attribute called "Spell Points." Casting spells (usually)
requires the use of spell points, and also the use of gems. Some spells don't
cost any spell points, others don't cost any gems, but most spells use up both.
The number of spell points Sorcerers and Archers have depends on their level and
their intelligence, while the number of spell points Clerics or Paladins have
depends on their level and their Personality.

 Any spellcaster who is alive, awake, and has enough gems and spell points can
attempt to cast spells at any time, whether he is engaged in hand-to-hand combat
or not. Depending on circumstances, the selected spell may fail, or if the
selected spell is inappropriate due to spell limitations, the caster may not be
allowed to throw that spell at that time.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9743

 There are a number of limitations on spells limiting when and where they can be
used, and what their effects are. To find out what the limits are for any given
spell, read the spell descriptions in the manual. A spell's limits may prevent
you from casting that spell at a certain time and place, or they may just cause
the spell to fail. For example: Sorcerer spell S 3-4 (Lightning Bolt) can only
be cast when your party is in combat; Sorcerer spell S 4-4 (Guard Dog) can only
be cast when the party is not in combat; Clerical spell C 7-3 (Moon Ray) only
works outdoors.

 PROBLEMS DURING SPELLCASTING

 Probably the biggest single problem players have with spells is in the use of
spells that will not work on monsters in hand-to-hand combat. Not only doesn't
the spell work, but the character who threw the spell not only loses spell
points and gems, he also loses the opportunity to do something useful until the
next round.

 Monsters in hand-to-hand combat are very close to at least one member of your
party, and the wrong type of spell could hurt party members as well as the
monsters. Rather than hurting your party, your spell just doesn't work, and you
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9745

see the message "Spell Failed."

 The description of these spells in the manual states (following the category
TYPE) "Combat, not in hand-to-hand." Examples of this type of spell are:
Clerical spell C 3-1 (Cold Ray); Sorcerer spell S 4-3 (Fire Ball).

 A problem that occasionally irritated me was that I would try to use S 2-1
(Eagle Eye) indoors and S 3-6 (Wizard Eye) outdoors. The effect of these two
spells is similar; the "Protect" display area shows a map of the area
surrounding your party, but neither spell will function in the wrong
environment.

 There are two Clerical spells for dispelling Undead monsters: C 1-7 (Turn
Undead) and C 9-2 (Holy Word). Their effects are similar; if the spells are
successful, undead monsters are eradicated. The number of undead monsters
dispelled by C 1-7 depends on the level of the character casting the spell; C
9-2 dispels all of the undead monsters in the enemy's party. When using C 1-7,
Paladins can apparently turn as many undead as Clerics of the same level.

 Only one of these spells can be effective in a single encounter. Repeated
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9747

casting of the same spell will fail, as will attempts to use the other spell.
Failed spells will cost spell points and gems.

 OTHER SPELLCASTING PROBLEMS

 Spell C 6-2 (Rejuvenate): Don't use this spell! It backfires more often than it
works. There are safer ways to grow younger (take a cruise to a distant resort,
for example).

 Some monsters are immune to certain spells. For instance, throwing lightning at
lightning bugs doesn't achieve much in the way of damaging the bugs, and Frost
Dragons aren't too unhappy if you throw a Cold Ray at them.

 If you encounter a monster who seems immune to the spells you normally use, try
using other spells which cause other types of damage. If you can't hurt a Fire
Elemental with a Fire Ball, try a Cold Ray!

 A TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THE REGIONS OF CRON

 The land of Cron contains many dangers, but it also has many 




natural
attractions. The wise traveler should always be prepared for danger, from flora,
fauna, and natural elements, but shou
ld not let caution deter him from noting
the many wonders of Cron.

 In this travelogue, you will find general descr


iptions o

f the 20 regions of
Cron. For more detailed descriptions of the caves, caverns, dungeons, and towers
of Cron, you should consult the Guide to the Cron Underground (Part 7). Exact
locations of the features described in these two works may be found in the Cron
Gazetteer (Part 8).

 REGION A1
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-9751


 The town of Tundara is situated in the southeastern corner of this region.
Surrounding Tundara are the Ice Plains, which make up half of the area.

 The other half of A1 is an extension of the Plane of Air into our dimension.
Mountains form a natural barrier between the Plane of Air and the rest of Cron.

 Travel in this region is difficult; even experienced navigators lose their way
due to the constant glare from the snow. Novice and seasoned travelers alike are
occasionally trapped by natural disasters such as blizzards and avalanches; you
should closely monitor the health of your party.

 In spite of the dangers of traveling in this region, there are also rewards. In
the mountains, a careful search will uncover the secret of an ancient clerical
spell, and traveling through the extension of the Plane of Air may inspire your
clerics to develop another spell to make travel here safer. It is rumored that a
passage exists that will take travelers back to the mythical "Time of Air."

 Another rumor suggests that in a past age, the area around what is now Tundara
was ruled by a mighty warrior with an invincible magical weapon.
 !CompuServe TEG-9753


 REGION A2

 Almost the entire northern half of this region is covered by the Ice Plains. To
the east there is a small group of mountains; it is rumored there are some very
powerful monsters in these mountains who may hold the secret of an extremely
potent Sorcerer Spell.

 A close search of the ice has been known to turn up valuable artifacts, perhaps
lost ages ago. In the western part of the ice lives the dreaded Death Spider,
who holds a key to success in your near future. Anger her not, however: Not only
will you lose her valuable treasure, you may also lose your life.

 Southern A2 is covered with woods and mountains. Hidden in a valley between
mountains surrounded by forest, there is rumored to be a stronghold filled with
gold, and a magical fountain that makes even the oldest adventurers caper with
joy. Somewhere in the region is another fountain, whose effects are contrary to
the effects of this one. In the southern mountains, the degenerate descendants
of ancient nobles protect their legacy: a magic weapon rumored to have great
value.
 !CompuServe TEG-9755


 The forest thins toward the west. The woods in this region are filled with
patrols of militia and their allies. These patrols guard the approach to Castle
Pinehurst, hold of Lord Peabody. Peabody can be extremely helpful if you have an
interest in the history of Cron.

 REGION A3

 This region is mostly ocean to the south, with a small plain surrounded by
mountains and forest to the north. There is also a peninsula that extends quite
far out into the ocean.

 Here you will find a number of sea-going monsters, and the peninsula is a
favorite roost for flying dragons. A fearless gourmet makes his residence on the
peninsula, and will be generous with those who can hold his interest.

 Near the southern border are the Pearl Islands where the enterprising party can
find treasure and possible allies.

 REGION A4
 !CompuServe TEG-9757


 Most of this region is ocean. Half of it is the normal ocean of Cron, while the
other half is covered by water that has leaked from the other-dimensional
Elemental Plane of Water. It is rumored that passage can be made through the
leak into the "Time of Water."

 Separating the normal and Elemental oceans is a mountain range. In the
mountains is hidden an ancient Clerical Spell, and travel through the Plane of
Water may inspire your clerics to develop a spell to make water travel simpler.

 Several of the Pearl Islands are in this region, as well as the much larger
island where you will find Atlantium. Also, you will find several magical
fountains on the Atlantium island; remember that appearances may be deceiving,
especially in Cron.

 Magical transportation spells don't work well in this region, forcing
adventurers to travel on foot.

 REGION B1

 !CompuServe TEG-9862

 Most of this region is covered with ice, and travel here is difficult, even for
the experienced traveler. Beware of blizzards and snow drifts which can cause
frostbite and more dangerous damage if ignored.

 Standing by itself in the middle of the Ice Plains is a single mountain. Myths
tell of the evil monsters who use this mountain as a place to hide from pursuit,
and a place to prepare for raids on creatures in nearby regions. The monsters
described in the myths are cunning and ruthless, and would probably booby-trap
their fortress extensively...if they actually existed.

 Careful exploration of the Ice will reveal an ancient fortress; a favor done
for its Lord will repay you well. It is rumored that somewhere on the ice lives
a magical creature (while the rumors aren't entirely clear, it is probably not a
goose) who will provide your party with gold.

 In the forest to the northeast, you may encounter a group of lumberjacks who
will treat you well if you can gain their respect.

 Be careful what you eat and drink here.

 !CompuServe TEG-9863

 REGION B2

 This region is composed of a variety of terrain types making it an interesting
place to explore. In the mountains to the west your party will encounter great
danger and even greater treasure.

 This region is split by a road running from east to west. South of the road is
mostly forest, while north of the road is mostly ice plains. Depending on the
time of the year, a number of organizations use this area for conventions: North
of the road in the east you may disrupt a Merchants' Meeting, while south of the
road, you may find OrcCon and the Circus. Visits to the Circus can help you
become a better person.

 There are two secluded clearings in the southern woods. One is of great
interest to Archers, while the other provides a quick method of travel.

 Beware of stuff dripping from the sky, and be careful what you eat!

 REGION B3

 !CompuServe TEG-9865

 This area is mostly open land on the shores of a bay. In the bay is the long,
wasp-waisted Isle of the Ancients. Rumors indicate that the mountains on this
island conceal the hideaways of two ancient, powerful wizards.

 The north shore is dominated by the mighty Dread Knight and his companion, the
Jouster. While the Dread Knight will only compete with Knights, the Jouster will
attempt to slaughter anyone who visits the region. The eastern shore is calm and
inhabited mostly by Druids.

 REGION B4

 Among the most visited regions of Cron, this area also has some of Cron's most
deadly inhabitants. The eastern half is plains bounded by the ocean, a mountain
range, and forest, and the natives are extremely hostile to strangers, often
seeming crazed. They have been known to capture parties and hold them for
ransom, possibly disposing of them if their ransom demands are not met.

 Successful journeying among the natives may help your clerics learn a powerful
spell.

 !CompuServe TEG-9891

 Part of the Isle of the Ancients extends into this region, and in the southwest
waters is Murray's Resort Island. Murray's is a place that should be seen by
everyone, young and old alike (actually, young and old are the same).

 There are reports of fabulous riches to be found in the shallow water along the
eastern shore.

 REGION C1

 Seen from above (by those with access to a Witch's Broom or a Fly Spell), this
region is covered with beautiful green forest. From ground level, the view isn't
so beautiful; indeed, it seems as if most of the undead and unholy monsters of
Cron use this area for their meetings!

 Rumor says Corak's soul wanders through the forest, vainly searching for his
body. Some say the strongest of Clerical spells is also hidden here.

 To the west are two magical fountains that can aid a traveler with his
spellcasting, and Hungry Devils guarding a potent Sorcerer Spell.

 !CompuServe TEG-9893

 The mad hermit Mark awaits parties in the southwestern corner, rewarding
parties that help him while punishing those who won't.

 REGION C2

 This region is home to the town of Sandsobar and is likely to become very
familiar to player-characters. Part of a wide, gentle plain surrounded by
distant mountains, this is a very pleasant area.

 There are three magic fountains here, two of which are at least benevolent for
characters. In the southwest lives a tribe of Orcs who will attack intruders,
but who never leave their protected valley. Here one can also find the Tomb of
Corak, which explains why his soul has never found his body.

 A major landmark is Square Lake and the mountain that rises from it. Your
characters have often heard whispers that the final reward for a good lifetime
may be found in this mountain.

 In the southwest is a magical pit which can prove fatal to inexperienced
characters. To the east are the ruins of a mighty castle which appears to have
 !CompuServe TEG-9895

been destroyed within the last 100 years.

 Clearly, the former residence of a great power now laid low, the ruins of this
castle intrigue most visitors, somehow causing them to feel a vague desire to
return this castle to its former glory.

 Few in this modern era have visited the Square Lake Mountain. Fewer still have
returned, empty-handed, telling wild tales of invisible forces guarding a
majestic entrance; presumably, those who have not returned were able to pass
through this entrance.

 REGION C3

 Bounded by mountains to the north and east, the ocean to the west, and the
Forbidden Forest to the south, this land is the home to many Druids. Indeed,
there are stories concerning the great Druid Stronghold which suggests that it
is somewhere in the area.

 A mountain ridge runs between the open grassland of the Druids and the dark
Forbidden Forest. There are myths that suggest that the Druids themselves
 !CompuServe TEG-9896

created these mountains to prevent an invasion of monsters from the southeast.
The mountains are currently inhabited by tribes of hard barbarians, who favor
neither the Druids nor the monsters, and challenge anyone trying to pass
through.

 There are rumors of a monster-ridden counterpart to the Druid Stronghold, in
the far southeast, where an invasion army is being quartered and trained. The
Forbidden Forest is being patrolled by militia from this Fort. From their
willingness to accept a bribe, it seems that this army is not yet ready to
attack.

 The ferry to Murray's Resort Island leaves from a dock in this region; such is
the power commanded by Murray that a path running directly east from Murray's
Dock to the enchanted road seems to be even safer than the road itself.

 On the north shore of the Druids' grassland, there lives a crazy old coot with
an obsession for an exotic munchie. Although he is practically senile, he has a
store of useful information, particularly about Nature, his deity for the last
500 years (give or take a few).

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9898

 REGION C4

 Once a very pleasant area, this region is now choked with a hot, wet forest,
and much of the region has become an evil swamp. There is very little to draw a
visitor here, and often those who wander into and through the swamp never come
back. Walk on water and levitate spells don't seem to work in quicksand!

 While most of the Temples and religions in Cron hold that it's a long way to
hell, your characters can never be closer to hell than they are here!

 In the early years of the 8th Era, King Kalohn fought the Mega-Dragon in this
region, turning it into the dreary place it is today.

 REGION D1

 As you travel further to the east, Cron becomes gradually more mountainous;
this region is almost completely surrounded by mountain ranges. However, the
largest mountain in the region is not there any longer, having been destroyed by
King Kalohn in one of his battles to save Cron. The former mountain is now a
Dead Zone, and those who enter the Dead Zone quickly sicken. Even characters who
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9923

only take one step into the zone feel its effects, and those with less hardy
constitutions often die immediately.

 The disease does not provide a painless death! The disease produces blisters
that resemble fire burns; blindness and hair loss quickly follow, then death.
Anyone who accidentally enters the Dead Zone requires immediate treatment!

 The forces of Nature are trying to heal this terrible wound to the land, and it
is rumored that on certain occasions, the magic of Nature is enough to
temporarily offset whatever is causing the disease. It is further rumored that
the spell the King used to devastate the mountain may be found somewhere in this
region.

 Because of the mountains, many dragons frequent this region, including the
fearsome Dragon Lord, one of the Envoys of Evil. The Dragons have set up their
own kingdom -- the Dragons' Dominion -- in the mountains to the north. Only the
powerful may enter this kingdom and return alive.

 Barbarians in the mountains guard an ancient artifact, even though they no
longer understand its significance.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9925


 There are several peaceful goblin villages in valleys in the southern
mountains, ruled by a clown named Bozorc. Bozorc likes to hold captives for
ransom, and kill them and whomever brings the ransom. A party that manages to
free some of his victims might make some loyal friends.

 REGION D2

 This land is the site of Luxus Palace Royale, home of Queen Lamanda, the
reigning monarch of Cron. Luxus, in the northeast corner of this area, is still
a magnificent sight, and gives hope that the rest of Cron can be restored to its
former glory.

 Also in this region is the Queen's Orchard, which is guarded by very tough
patrols of the Queen's militia. Raiding the Orchard may be a bad idea.

 An evil Baron, Mandagul, has set up a toll station on the road, and won't let
anyone pass without paying.

 Mount Farview is in the southern portion of this region, and the 12 Jurors
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9927

reside there. Visit them for information for your Jurors' Quests!

 The valleys in the southern mountains hold danger for the unwary traveler. In
the southeast is a portion of the Desert of Desolation. The Desert offers many
dangers, not the least of which is being caught unprotected in a sandstorm.

 REGION D3

 While this region looks placid, it is the home of two of the most evil
creatures in Cron. Their modus operandi is to imprison powerful creatures,
torture them for their secrets, then kill them. More than one resident of Cron
would love to see them dead!

 This area is also inhabited by elusive tribes of natives. Your party will never
encounter the average tribesman, but groups of tribal Shamans often gather here.
Offer them no mercy, because unless you stop them first, they will paralyze your
party and kill all its members!

 A corner of the Desert of Desolation extends into this region.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9928

 REGION D4

 This region is almost entirely swamp, and also the location of Lord Slayer's
Castle HillStone. The Quagmire of Doom, as the swamp is known, is bounded to the
northeast by mountains; on the plain north of the mountain you may find an
interesting gathering of monsters.

 One of the ancient Swords of Nobility is located in this region, guarded by a
group who regard it as the icon of their religion. They will not give up their
treasure willingly!

 There is a steady traffic of monsters into the middle of the swamp.
Observations show that when these monsters enter the swamp, they look slow,
drawn out, and tired. When they leave, they look happy and relaxed. Clever spies
have tried to follow these monsters, but none has ever returned.

 REGION E1

 In this region, Cron and an extension of the Elemental Plane of Fire coexist,
separated by only a thin mountain range. It is rumored that a group of clerics
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9930

escaping from a volcano may have left a spell somewhere in these barrier
mountains, but where and what the spell is the rumors don't stay.

 Traveling through the extension of the Plane of Fire, an alert cleric may come
to an understanding of the dangers of the environment, and fashion a spell to
deal with it.

 The Cron side of the region is extremely mountainous, with active volcanoes and
pools of molten lava waiting to trap the unwary traveler. Beware the effects of
indigenous magical waters!

 Nestled in a valley to the southwest is the town of Vulcania, which provides a
safe haven for parties that visit this region. A little north of Vulcania is a
place that is famous for the quality and quantity of magical gemstones found
there.

 In the farthest corner of this region, intrepid adventures may discover a
passage to the "Time of Fire."

 REGION E2
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-9932


 Virtually all desert, this is the most dangerous region in Cron. In the valleys
of the modest mountains to the north live some of Cron's most vicious monsters,
guarding some of its most outstanding treasures.

 Desert travel is extremely difficult, the more so because of the many monsters
waiting concealed in the sand. It is rumored that the Crawling Envoy of Evil
lives somewhere in this region.

 There are a number of oases where travelers can safely replenish their food
s
upply, and somewhere in the desert expanse is a magical fountain often called
"The Greatest Fountain."

 Visitors to other eras will find that this region has always been the most
dangerous area in Cron; some suspect that the invading aliens found their first
foothold here.

 In the distant past, a Holy One of incredible charisma lived in this region,
surrounded by his disciples. While existing traces of this Holy One have mostly
vanished, he is often referred to in legends in terms of an outstanding physical
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-9934

characteristic, "The Wide One," or perhaps "The Tall One," or even "The Long
One"; each resident of this land tells a different story.

 REGION E3

 This region is mostly desert to the north, changing to plains in the south.
Whispered rumors hint that one of the three Envoys of Evil lives in this area,
and guards a sacred pool that has the power to help a mortal enhance his
attributes to a virtually god-like level.

 Earthquakes, which rock this area frequently, may have uncovered a secret
hideout for many of the villains that roam southeastern Cron.

 REGION E4

 In this land is an extension of the Elemental Plane of Earth into the dimension
of Cron, blocked from further encroaching on Cron by a ridge of mountains. Those
who lived in the mountains have long since died out, leaving behind a valuable
spell.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-10045

 Travel in the extension of the Plane of Earth will show your clerics how to
protect the party in the "Time of Earth." A passage to the Time of Earth is
rumored to exist in this area.

 The town of Sandsobar sits in the middle of a wide plain in this region.

 TIME TRAVEL

 Lord Peabody's "WayBack Machine" can take your party back into Cron's past
where you can (hopefully) alter history. The current society of Cron didn't
exist until recently, so you should not expect to find that everything in the
past has a counterpart in the present, or vice versa.

 The landscape of Cron hasn't changed too much through the eras (except for
Starburst Mountain in D1 and the Quagmire of Doom in C4/D4). You can even find
the sites of towns and castles in the earlier eras, although they are either
empty or populated by random monsters.

 In general, the populations of the past eras are more uniform than the Cron of
the 900s, and encounters are usually more dangerous. In the past, Cron is (was?)
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-10047

populated by lots of Elementals and their cronies, while men and man-like
creatures were the exception.

 The most important past Era is the 8th Era, as this is when King Kalohn ruled
and was deposed. Fortunately for your party and Cron, the WayBack Machine will
allow you to intervene in his final battle at just the right time!

 Another interesting feature of the 8th Era is Mystic Castle Xabran, where all
kinds of useful knowledge is gathered. In Castle Xabran, your party can learn
where to find each missing spell, where to find hirelings, and you can pick up
some of the items you need to complete your quests.

 Most of the visitors to Xabran are extremely powerful, and they are trying to
use the knowledge stored here to increase their powers. It may be wise to avoid
other parties.

 Even though most of the visitors here are dangerous, usually they're here to
study and don't really want to fight. If you inadvertently disturb them, try
bribery before you attack.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-10049

 There is no spell to cast or person to see to go back to the future; however,
if you rest occasionally, you will be drawn to your own time during one of the
rest periods. There is no way to determine exactly how long you will remain in
the past.

 There is an exception to this. If you dismiss your Hirelings, they will return
immediately to the last Inn they stayed at, taking with them everything they are
carrying. A neat trick, eh?

 MIGHT AND MAGIC II
       Part 6

 TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THE TOWNS OF CRON

 The five towns in modern Cron are Middlegate (1st level party), Atlantium
(7th), Tundara (5th), Vulcania (6th), and Sandsobar (5th). All player-characters
start the game in Middlegate (the safest town). Your party should probably not
leave Middlegate before the party members reach the third or fourth level. There
is plenty to keep your interest, even in this safest of towns!

 The note after each town is to provide you with an indication of how dangerous
the town really is. If each of your characters in a party of six is at the
experience level noted, your party should win most (but not necessarily all)
encounters in that town.

 All towns share certain general features. These are:
 !CompuServe TEG-10052


 INN: A place to stay in safety. Also, where you should go to save the game at
intervals. (Note that while you're safe as a guest at an Inn, you may be
attacked in its lobby.) Inns are free.

 BLACKSMITH: You can buy and sell armor, weapons, and miscellaneous items at the
local Smithy. The Smith will also identify items (for player characters only)
for a nominal fee. Some Smiths can sell you a colored ticket. This ticket will
enable you to compete in one of the Combat Arenas.

 TAVERN: In a tavern you can provision your party, have a drink, eat a gourmet
meal, hear rumors, and sometimes meet hirelings.

 TOWN GATE: Each town is surrounded by a wall. The only way to leave or enter a
town without using some type of magic is through the Town Gate.

 PORTAL: The portals provide instantaneous travel from one town to another. Most
towns have two portals; Middlegate has only one. Portals usually provide two-way
transportation: The portal you arrived through can send you back to where you
came from.
 !CompuServe TEG-10057


 MAGES GUILD: Sorcerers and Archers who are members of the local Mages Guild may
buy spells from the Guild. The mage who can sell you Guild membership can
usually be found not too far away from the Guild hall.

 TEMPLES: The Temple is one of the most important features in any town,
especially for low-level adventurers. The Clerics in the Temple will cure you of
any afflictions or wounds, remove any curses on your party, restore your
alignment, and restore life to dead or eradicated party members (all for a
price).

 If you donate generously at a Temple, the Clerics of that Temple may respond by
blessing your party for a day (casting protection spells on your party).

 TRAINING CENTERS: These train you in your profession, allowing you to advance
to the next level -- when you have accumulated enough experience, and providing
you can pay! Spellcasters should rest after they go up a level.

 SKILL SCHOOLS: At these schools you can learn useful secondary skills, such as
Cartography (very important), Navigation, Mountain Climbing, and Path-Finding.
 !CompuServe TEG-10078


 LOCKSMITH: Most towns have a Locksmith who would love to sell you a key. Each
Locksmith has a unique color for his keys. Having these keys will turn out to be
helpful when you are exploring the various castles in Cron.

 COMBAT ARENA: Some towns have arenas where you can fight opponents (selected by
the games master) for experience and gold (if you win). You need a ticket (buy
tickets at most Blacksmiths) to fight in a Combat Arena. Any color ticket is
valid in any of the Combat Arenas.

 A ticket and a key purchased in the same town are the same color; this might
suggest that there is some relationship between keys and tickets.

 Whenever you enter a new town, you should seek out these places, as it will
become important to know where they are.

 MIDDLEGATE

 You can find enough excitement and treasure in Middlegate to keep you satisfied
for quite some time. Virtually every building in this town has a resident
 !CompuServe TEG-10140

monster (or group of monsters), most of whom are unfriendly. The treasures you
find in Middlegate contain mostly gold and gems, with only an occasional magic
item.

 In Middlegate, you will find:

 The Middlegate Inn, where every player-character joins the game. A quiet place,
but you might find some excitement in the back room!

 S. J. Blacksmith, near the Inn. Whenever you shop here, be sure to check out
"Today's Specials"; you can occasionally buy +3 weapons.

 Slaughtered Lamb Tavern, also near the Inn. Rumors heard here could help you
complete your first two minor quests, and perhaps help you find some hirelings.
One of the meals here will help you avoid a fight and find a magic fountain!

 Sleepy's Mage Guild on the North side of Town. Sleepy lives on the West Side.

 Gateway Temple is very close to the Inn. This is a good place, with the lowest
prices in Cron.
 !CompuServe TEG-10142


 Turkov's Training, just east of the Temple. Again, the best prices in Cron.

 The Town Gates are located in the North Wall of town, just west of Sleepy's
Mage Guild. Middlegate is on the shore of Square Lake, on a wide wooded region
surrounded by mountains.

 In northwest Middlegate are Edmund's Expeditions, and Track and Trail, where
your characters can learn skills useful for outdoor adventuring. At least two
members of your party should learn each of these skills.

 Nearby you will find the shop of "Otto Mapper, Esq." where your characters can
learn to make maps (probably the most important secondary skill your party can
have).

 In southern Middlegate live the Wizard Nordon and his sister Nordonna, who will
provide you with rewards if you will perform a service for each of them. Perform
Nordon's quest again, for additional rewards.

 Nordonna's quest may help you find your first hirelings. The information she
 !CompuServe TEG-10143

provides as your reward is very important; if you ignore it, you may handicap
your party throughout the rest of the game!

 West of the Middlegate Inn you will find the Poorman's Portal. The worker at
the Portal will send you to Sandsobar for a price.

 Along the east wall of the town you will find the Travelmoore Travel Agency and
the Combat Arena.

 As soon as your party learns one of the spells that will allow you to cross
bodies of water (Walk on Water or Fly), you should visit Murray's Resort.
One-way tickets are available at Travelmoore. Be sure you can make a map before
going to Murray's or you might get lost on the way home.

 One of the services offered at Murray's Resort will be useful throughout the
game (although young characters should be careful about their ages)!

 You can buy an Arena ticket at the Blacksmith's. This ticket is a very good
investment; it costs only 10 gold pieces but returns 200, and experience points
as well. While it is true that there is some risk involved, what investment is
 !CompuServe TEG-10308

completely risk-free?

 Like any town, there is some chance of hostile encounters on the streets of
Middlegate (these days it's called being mugged). There are also two street
corners where you will always encounter hostile monsters. I wonder what they're
guarding?

 I've left out a few things, like the entrance to the cavern under the city (not
far from Nordon's), the Brain Detoxification Center, Feldecarb Fountain, the
Fountain of Clairvoyance, and Lock and Key, Ltd. You will need to find out about
them yourself.

 SANDSOBAR

 The Poorman's Portal leads to Sandsobar, the second town you should visit. Many
of the buildings here are empty, and most of the streets are fairly safe. When
you're exploring, be very careful when you enter long alleys or the Slums!

 There are lots of undead monsters in Sandsobar, so be sure to bring your
Cleric. Many of the monsters you encounter can throw sleep spells; some sort of
 !CompuServe TEG-10310

protection against sleep might be a good investment before you visit this town.

 Like Middlegate, Sandsobar has the standard facilities:

 Hourglass Inn, in northwest Sandsobar. A quiet, no frills, no excitement sort
of place.

 Red Lantern Tavern in the same building as the Inn, facing onto a narrow
north/south alleyway. This is a rowdy place. The drinks are standard, and the
food is usually okay. The barmaid gives the impression that she really goes for
macho men. Rumors might not contain the whole story.

 Temple Benedictus is across the alley from the Tavern.

 Whirlwind Mage Guild is on the same alley, south of the Temple.

 Sheik Training Arena is one block south of the Inn on the same street.

 Big Al's Accessories is the Blacksmith. His shop is inside the north wall of
town.
Press <CR> for more !






CompuServe TEG-10311


 There is a combat arena called the Monster Bowl on the east end of the main
east/west street in town. There are supply rooms in the corners of the arena.
You can expect some mundane encounters in the supply rooms.

 Portal Dune, near the south wall, provides instant transport to and from
Middlegate. Sirocco Portal, along the north wall, supplies transport to and from
Tundara.

 The Town Exit, in the northwest corner of town, leads out to the Plains of
Peril.

 While getting involved in the arguments of other people might get you killed,
avoiding a brawl might mean that you miss a clue!

 Before you can purchase magical spells at the Mage Guild, you will have to find
a drunken sorcerer. Search the buildings along the west wall of town.

 You can pick up a useful third-level sorcerer spell in the building across the
way from the Monster Bowl.
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-10313


 In the southwest corner of town, your characters can learn some useful skills,
including picking pockets, gambling, and diplomacy.

 In the northeast corner of town are what appear to be several private
residences. While some are empty, the residents of the others do not take kindly
to trespassers.

 Probably the most interesting place (as well as the most dangerous) in
Sandsobar is the Slum, in the southeast corner near Dune Portal. Here, you will
find graffiti on the walls, secret passages, people in trouble, and the entrance
to the cavern under the town. Kindness to strangers pays off; it might even help
you find Star Burst!

 Fitpro Locksmith, near the Dune Portal, will sell you a yellow key.

 TUNDARA

 Tundara is a small town in the middle of the inhospitable Ice Plains. Much of
the business conducted here occurs in the "business regions," which are between
 !CompuServe TEG-10315

the northern and southern walls. The inner town contains most of the facilities
a visitor would use on a regular basis.

 The passage from the town proper to the business regions is concealed along the
inner west wall (ignore the keep out sign).

 The streets of inner Tundara are safe enough to be boring. Most of the
buildings are of little interest to explorers, being empty. There are rumors of
monsters between the walls and inside the outer wall.

 In Tundara, you will find:

 The Tundaran Arms Inn, a normal enough establishment, and very cordial.

 The Enhancement Center.

 Lucky Dog Saloon. Even if you're not hungry, you should examine the menu at the
Lucky Dog Saloon; you never know when you (or someone you meet) may be
interested in munchies!

 !CompuServe TEG-10316

 Thundrax Weaponry, the only smithy who doesn't sell tickets for the various
combat arenas.

 The town exit is in the northwest corner, and leads to the Ice Tundra.

 The La Porte Portal is located in the Inn, and transports you to and from
Sandsobar. The Polar Portal, located inside the Saloon, allows travel to and
from Vulcania.

 You will find both the White Dove Temple and the Mystical Mage Guild in the
business region between the northern walls. Nearby are shops to train you in
some useful secondary skills. Important quests are not just given to anyone, but
are offered to those with experience as a crusader. Getting lost in the
wilderness is frustrating and not funny. A merchant can usually find a way to
get his party a better deal from the stores in a village.

 To join the Mage Guild, search the buildings near the Saloon.

 Your characters can pick up some useful secondary skills in the business region
between the Northern walls, at Sarcen's Denial, the International Market, and
 !CompuServe TEG-10318

Columbus's Sextant. Pay close attention to the promotional spiels you hear in
these places; learning one of these skills will help keep you from losing your
temper (among other things) as you try to explore in the wilderness.

 There is an organization called Frozen Monster between the south walls of the
town. Frozen Monster employees do not like outsiders poking around.

 Recently, the residents of Tundara have been vanishing. It is rumored that a
snowbeast makes its home inside the outer wall. So far, none of those who went
to find and destroy this beast have returned. Darker rumors indicate magic may
be useless against the snowbeast.

 In very bad winters, the residents of Tundara descend into the cavern below the
town for warmth and protection. The entrance is near the center of town,
well-hidden so outsiders can't find it.

 For reasons no longer remembered, there is a third walled-off region bordering
on the Saloon and Inn. No one can say definitely what's in there, but
apparently, those who enter never come back.

 !CompuServe TEG-10320

 The recent disappearance of local residents, especially old Hanna, a citizen of
some repute, has made the local constabulary a little jumpy. If you should
somehow come into possession of any items that the law might recognize, it might
be well to think of some way to conceal them until you can leave town! If you
are caught and you are innocent, don't worry too much; justice will (eventually)
prevail.

 Hanna was investigating rumors of a secret passage into the outer wall,
somewhere on the east side of town.

 VULCANIA

 Vulcania is a harsh and dangerous town, set in a forbidding landscape. It is
rumored Vulcania is built inside an active volcano, and there are actually
places in town where liquid lava can be found (although none of my characters
has ever found these places).

 Don't come here until your characters learn to win fights without magic, as
magic doesn't work in many sections of this town. There is no way to know in
advance if magic will work in a given location; either your party or the
 !CompuServe TEG-10322

monsters you are fighting will have to see a spell fail before you can be sure.
There is one advantage to your party in these non-magical areas: Most
spell-using monsters will try to cast spells several times before they realize
they are in a non-magical area. If you are smart and tough, you can win the
engagement before they start to fight back.

 In Vulcania you will find:

 Belinthra's Bar, a nice enough place, although those who regularly patronize
this establishment are often accosted by riffraff. Occasionally, there are
patrons here who can be enticed into accompanying your party.

 The Training Academy is the second best such academy in Cron.

 The Vulcanian Transport takes you to and from Tundara; the Vulcanian Export
takes you to and from Atlantium.

 The Hotel Four has adequate facilities, but surly employees.

 These places are all close together because they are in a fairly safe
Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe TEG-10347

neighborhood.

 At the Lava Locksmith, you can buy a red key.

 The entrance to the cavern under the town is located in an alley near the
hotel. Also concealed here is a secret door.

 The Blackrock Mage Guild is along a major east/west street.

 The Bestway Blacksmith Shop is along the east wall of town.

 The Vulcan Temple is near the smithy.

 Near the Mages Guild is a small building housing a magical scale. If you've
noticed that your party seems to be more vulnerable to some spells than others,
this scale will help you to figure out why.

 A bit west of the Mages Guild on the same street, you can find the sorcerer who
sells guild memberships.

Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-10453

 There are three shops in town that provide training in secondary skills. The
training offered is especially useful for soldiers and fighters.

 In the Town Square (at the center of town) are four statues that should
definitely be on your "must see" list. However, be careful leaving Town Square
to the north, as you will be entering the wild section of town. If you dare
enter this area, rest assured that no one you meet there will be friendly!

 ATLANTIUM

 Atlantium is the richest, most snobbish, and most dangerous town to explore.

 Along the east and west walls in Atlantium, you will find several statues. The
plaques on these statues will provide you with hints about the quests that each
character class must complete before the world can be saved. You can find
further information in Region D2, at Mt. Farview.

 In Atlantium, you will find:

 The Carriage Inn, a high class establishment with friendly employees.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe TEG-10455


 Drewnhald Ironworks, not far from the Inn. The most powerful artifacts for sale
in Cron may be bought here.

 The Colosseum, the best and most dangerous of the battle arenas, is in the
center of town. You will receive a better reward for winning a battle in the
Colosseum than in any of the other battle arenas, but you will face more
dangerous opponents, as well.

 The Elusian Temple, the Cabalist Mage Guild (6,4), and the Classic Key Shoppe
flank the Colosseum to the west, while Island Training and the Boar's Tongue
Tavern flank it to the east.

 The Beautify Atlantium Portal allows travel to and from Vulcania; the Mystic
Portal provides one-way transportation to Middlegate.

 The entrance to the cavern below Atlantium is in the northwest corner of town.
Near the entrance to the cavern you can also find the City Jail. Don't enter
this building unless you are prepared to fight your way out!

Press <CR> for more !

CompuServe TEG-10457

 There are three shops here where you can be trained in secondary skills; you
can learn the skills of Linguist (learning this skill can help you improve your
income by 100,000 gold pieces each year!), Athlete, or you can learn to be a
Hero/Heroine (Murray likes heroes).

 In the southern part of town are two rooming houses, one for Knights and
Warriors, while the other is for Sorcerers and Clerics. Many of the rooms are
occupied, and most of the residents aren't very friendly toward uninvited
guests. In the rooming house for Sorcerers and Clerics, be careful if you
encounter a Shaman, especially if you encounter several. If they are teamed with
Illusionists, run, don't fight! A 7th level party will _not_ survive the
encounter!

 THE GUIDE TO THE CRONIAN UNDERGROUND

 Many of the secrets of Cron are concealed in castles, caves, caverns, dungeons,
and towers. This guide will tell you a little about these places. There are a
few towers, which are also included here, as they don't seem to fit elsewhere.

 I. CAVERNS UNDER TOWNS:

 MIDDLEGATE CAVERN

 Located under Middlegate, this cavern is populated mainly by goblins and orcs.
Recovering items they have stolen from Middlegate will earn you thanks and
rewards when you return them to their rightful owners.

 !CompuServe TEG-10461

 Make sure you examine the walls and floors; there are secrets revealed here for
those who look in the right places.

 SANDSOBAR CAVERN

 Under Sandsobar is a dank cave inhabited by rats and thieves and others of
their ilk. During encounters it may be wise to remember that not all that you
hear is true, and that some thieves have honor.

 Here you will find one of the extremely few undead who are friendly to those
still living; his gift should be guarded for later use.

 Note the information you discover here: It may be a long time until you use it,
but it may save you time and frustration on your Jurors' Quest.

 TUNDARA CAVERN

 Located under Tundara, there are four sections to this cavern, along with a
magical device that can be used to travel about the cave. Look to the walls for
clues; look on the walls for red herrings. Don't play the slots unless you know
 !CompuServe TEG-10463

the stakes!

 VULCANIA CAVERN

 Below Vulcania is a hot, dark cave. Watch your step: The floor may be hot!
There are a number of secret passages here. If you endure until the end of each
of these paths, you will be rewarded.

 ATLANTIUM CAVERN

 This cavern is a maze of dead ends and connecting tunnels. At some of the dead
ends you will find statues. Be careful of the statues. some of them will cause
you harm, but remember that perseverance builds character. Figuring out the
various clues and traps here may enhance a character's IQ. Bring your surfboard
when you visit. Information found can help you find loyal companions, and help
you in future Quests.

 II. CASTLES AND DUNGEONS

 CASTLE HILLSTONE
 !CompuServe TEG-10465


 Castle HillStone is the home of Lord Slayer. Slayer is a fanatic about hunting,
and will reward parties that bring him new trophies. Guards circulate freely in
the building, and challenge you if you appear at all uneasy. Slayer keeps a zoo
of exotic animals for his entertainment.

 There are currently two prisoners here; free them and they will reward you.
Winning a Red Triple Crown will increase his pleasure and your reward.

 Somewhere in this castle is an ancient totem called a "N-19 Capitor."

 DUNGEON LEVEL 1

 Half-Orcs, Ninjas, and Barbarians are not welcome here, although there are
several magic items kept here that will benefit only Ninjas or Barbarians.

 There are unavoidable traps here; just grin and bear them, then get the guy who
trapped you! You may also find a device that enhances IQ but causes a loss in
strength, and a magical fountain. It is rumored that there is a portal to a
distant location somewhere in this dungeon.
 !CompuServe TEG-10466


 DUNGEON LEVEL 2

 Again, Half-orcs, Ninjas, and Barbarians are not welcome, and unavoidable traps
are scattered everywhere. You may find a magical fountain, and devices to
improve your strength.

 CASTLE PINEHURST

 Home of Lord Peabody (the inventor of the WayBack Machine) and Sherman, his pet
boy. The Bishop of Yellow Battle (near Battle Creek) is held in this castle.

 Many creatures roam the halls in this castle, and they are almost all deadly.
If you avoid the monsters, watch out for traps, and keep an eye on the date
(your date, not my date!). Would you know a B-12 Frammis if you saw one? How
about a J-29 Fluxor?

 DUNGEON LEVEL 1

 For some reason, Lord Peabody doesn't want Humans, Knights, or Paladins in his
 !CompuServe TEG-10491

dungeon. This is unfortunate since there is magic here that only works in their
hands.

 Accuracy is exceeded here, while speed recedes. Beware of traps! Instant travel
is offered and may be accepted, if you want!

 DUNGEON LEVEL 2

 Stay away Humans, Knights, and Paladins. There are some nice magic items here,
and one of the best rewards in all Cron may be found in the southwest corner.
Those who serve evil may chose to serve good, if only for a time.

 CASTLE WOODHAVEN

 This castle is the home of Lord Hoardall, who likes to collect things. He has
an absolutely fantastic memory and a mystic rapport with his treasures. He will
know instantly when you steal something, and he will never forget that you stole
it! The Green Bishop resides here unwillingly.

 Hoardall is sponsoring a convention of clerics and other healers who will try
 !CompuServe TEG-10493

and solve the problem of the sickness that strikes those who enter the Dead Zone
in D1. The opening day of the convention is May 27th, so you may see references
to the "M-27 Radicon" in this castle.

 DUNGEON LEVEL 1

 Hoardall dislikes Elves, Robbers, and Clerics, and does his best to keep them
out of his dungeons. This is unfortunate for them because there are powerful
magical items here to assist Robbers and Clerics.

 Your party will be repeatedly struck by darts as they wander the halls; these
traps are unavoidable. If you rest after these attacks, they should not
interfere too much with your explorations. Powerful magic in this dungeon can be
used to increase your personality (but don't forget how to lift weights
afterward!).

 DUNGEON LEVEL 2

 Travel in this dungeon is difficult; almost all of the doors are secret, and
random teleporters are scattered throughout the level. Elves, Robbers, and
 !CompuServe TEG-10609

Clerics are not welcome here even though there are treasures that will benefit
Robbers and Clerics.

 Alignments can be neutralized here, voluntarily. There are rumors of ways to
increase Luck, and trade Treasure for Experience. If you are clever and do a
good job of mapping, you may be able to secretly return to the Dragon's Head
Fountain with your Elves, so that they, too, may benefit.

 LUXUS PALACE ROYALE

 Queen Lamanda, current reigning Sovereign of Cron, maintains this magnificent
castle much as it seemed in the reign of her father, King Kalohn. To her, and
through her to the citizens of Cron, this mighty fortress represents the hope
and dream of saving Cron.

 The inside isn't as well-maintained as the outside, however. In some rooms,
dust covers everything, and the Royal Alchemist is making Fool's Gold to fill
Lamanda's coffers. Lamanda is desperate to rescue her father, and restore the
rightful order of things.

 !CompuServe TEG-10611

 In order to earn an interview with the Queen, your party must win a Black
Triple Crown and have all completed their Jurors' Quests. The Black Bishop,
imprisoned here, will also be glad to see the winners of the Black Triple Crown.
Corak used to live and work here, and is rumored to have quipped, "An 'A-1
Todilor' is a high-society baby learning to walk!"

 DUNGEON LEVEL 1

 Luxus Dungeon is a prison, filled with permanent spells that prevent magical
transportation. Your party should avoid guards, as they will charge you a hefty
fine for your unauthorized presence.

 Dwarves, Sorcerers, and Archers are unwelcome here, and strong magic items for
helping Sorcerers and Archers are hidden here. Clever parties may find ways to
enhance speed and strength from the features, although endurance may suffer.

 DUNGEON LEVEL 2

 This is an extremely chaotic place with random teleporters all over, and very
few walls. There are many wonders, if you can reach them, including ways to gain
 !CompuServe TEG-10613

additional hit points and speed, change sex and alignment, and increase your
existing hit points.

 In the northwest you may encounter a hit point salesman. His price is steep,
but his product is worth it!

 Don't ignore clues, look to the walls for some shocking information!

 Again, Dwarves, Archers, and Sorcerers are not wanted here; however, you should
sneak them in to visit the Hit Point Salesman -- as long as your money is good,
he doesn't care who you are, and you will handicap your characters if they don't
take advantage of this!

 III: TOWERS, CAVES, FORTS, AND MINES

 Presented in no specific order, here is some information on the other
dungeon-like areas in Cron.

 SARAKIN'S MINE

Press <CR> for more !



CompuServe TEG-10615

 Long noted for the amount of gold it produced, this once well-maintained mine
is now collapsing, making it a dangerous place to explore. Recently, stories
have circulated about two more foolish adventurers who went looking for easy
treasure and never returned.

 Stories told by others who visited the mine long ago and returned empty-handed
suggest the mine is haunted. Some of the story tellers claim there are gold
nuggets scattered on the floor of the mine, waiting for someone brave enough to
take them.

 Sarakin was obsessed by the desire to live forever, a goal he might have
reached only in death.

 GEMMAKER CAVE

 Gemmaker Cave is recessed into the side of an active volcano, surrounded by a
lake of molten lava. The Gemmaker himself (the legendary figure who is said to
have dug the cave) still resides here, but he is well-hidden and desires to see
few visitors. He sometimes rewards those who are ingenious enough to seek him
out with a very powerful sorcerer spell.
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-10616


 Occasionally, gems are formed in the crucible of the volcano, and the magic of
the Gemmaker somehow separates them from the lava, and scatters them throughout
the cave. He has never seemed to care what happened to these gems.

 Parties that venture into the cave without some protection against the fiery
heat in the rocks will soon regret their actions!

 CORAK'S CAVERN

 Corak's body, fittingly, rests in Corak's Cave. The body rests in honor in a
crypt, to which only Clerics and Robbers are ever permitted access.

 Hiding in the cave is Corak's assistant Lloyd, who is willing to teach a party
a special sorcerer spell. Lloyd hopes that in return, you will return Corak's
soul to his body.

 While Lloyd is not able to force you to help Corak, he is extending you his
trust.

 ICE CAVE

 Located in the middle of the Ice Plains, this is a dangerous place to visit.
Spread throughout the passages are traps that rob a party of their spells, and
may have less obvious, yet farther reaching affects, for good or ill.

 There are literally swarms of monsters here, and even a very powerful party
risks never leaving this cave alive.

 There is rumored to be a way to increase Personality stored here, but the rumor
adds that only a stag party (a stagette party?) might find it!

 RIFT CAVERN

 This cavern may be found on the edge of the Desert of Desolation. Occasionally,
fissures open up over this cave, plunging unsuspecting parties into the black
depths below.

 Someone is using this cave as a storehouse of supplies and weapons, and has
scattered obscure riddles and bits of information throughout. Often, those that
 !CompuServe TEG-10620

leave are faster than they were when they entered. Remember that neatness
promotes success!

 DRUIDS' STRONGHOLD

 The Druids' Stronghold is the home of the four varieties of Druids: Earth, Air,
Fire, and Water. Each has set traps for the unwary in these passages.

 You will have trouble resting here as the general surroundings are not
conducive to peaceful thought. Pay close attention to the walls; often a Druid
in a hurry might leave a note that he can return to later.

 There is an ominous feel in the air here, as if some major blasphemy is waiting
to happen, and a sense that you can prevent it. Look for someone who will reward
you for this task, because it is hazardous. The reward should be a very useful
spell. Exotic plants may lighten your party's load, especially any of your
characters who are connected to the sea.

 There is at least one very powerful monster here whose breed is less common in
Cron than it was centuries ago.

CompuServe TEG-10621


 FORBIDDEN FOREST FORT

 Sort of a companion and counterweight to the Druids' Stronghold, there is an
invading army based in this cavern. You will find lots of monsters. Most of them
are common soldiers and dangerous only in large numbers; there are large numbers
of them here!

 The MPs are tough; the Sergeants of the Fifth and Seventh Legions are tougher.
The officers in GHQ are very much tougher and include an Ancient Dragon.

 Paladins may find the answer to their Jurors' Quest here.

 THE DRAGON'S DOMINION

 This dark, smelly hole is home to at least 100 dragons of all types. Naturally,
there are fantastic treasures here for those strong enough to take them!

 There are many ancient artifacts of great power here -- such as a Titan's Pike
(does 1-40 points per round plus whatever the weapon's bonus is) -- many of
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe TEG-10623

which are unaligned. But the best rewards are not treasures of gold, gems, or
magic.

 There are three ways to gain hit points that are guarded by the Dragons. Two
are useful but not spectacular; the third is worth facing any danger to obtain!

 This great treasure of hit points is guarded by an Ancient Dragon, and will
only affect each character once in his lifetime (I think). So, go see what it
is!

 MURRAY'S CAVERN

 Part of Murray's Resort, Murray's Cavern is not a place for the timid. Part of
the cave is used for laboratories, where Murray's researchers seem to be trying
to build new types of monsters; the rest is reserved by Murray himself for the
offices and vaults required to store his great treasures and run his many
businesses.

 Murray can often be found in his office, if your party can pass his stringent
entrance requirements. However, you shouldn't break in on him unless you are
 !CompuServe TEG-10625

willing to do him a small favor.

 Note that Murray may be the single most powerful man-like being in Cron, so
don't irritate him. You really wouldn't like him when he's angry!

 DAWN'S BOG MIST RESORT

 Dawn used to be Murray's honey, but they've drifted apart (a long way apart).
Being something of a businesswoman, Dawn saw the vast potential earnings of a
resort for monsters, so she started one. While she and Murray don't usually
compete for the same customers, Murray would like to close Dawn's Resort just on
general principles.

 There is more to Dawn's than meets the eye. There are a lot of monsters here at
any one time, relaxing and enjoying the resort, but that doesn't make them less
dangerous.

 If a party is lucky here, they can increase their luck, and maybe find some
irelings.

Press <CR> for more !


CompuServe TEG-10626

 Dawn may not know what is hidden in her resort, but somewhere in it is one of
the most fabulous treasures in Cron, one you absolutely must recover to win the
game. One problem, though: Once you find it, how can you get it home?

 THE DARK KEEP AND THE TOWER OF MERCY

 These twin towers hold two of the most powerful sorcerers of ancient Cron, in
stasis. The towers are defended by a magical force that repels all but Sorcerers
and Robbers.

 Once in either of the towers, an exploration party will discover further
advances must be made through a dangerous maze-like area, in which battle may be
avoided if proper choices are made. There are clues to the proper choices in
some of the dungeons and caves.

 Once the party reaches its goal (a room in which one of the Sorcerers sleeps in
stasis), they will have to properly set a combination into two panels to turn
off the stasis. Of course, these combinations are hidden somewhere in the land
of Cron also.

 !CompuServe TEG-10628

 Setting the proper combinations release the Sorcerers, and the party of
Sorcerers and Robbers has just completed their Jurors' Quest. Simple, isn't it?

 THE SQUARE LAKE CAVE

 In the middle of Square Lake is a mountainous island into which is set an
entrance with the inscription "Chosen Ones Only."

 A "Chosen One" has received his Black Triple Crown, completed his Jurors'
Quest, and has been named as a Chosen One by Queen Lamanda.

 To prove their mettle, the party of the Chosen One must battle through an
interminable string of monsters and venture deeper and deeper into the Square
Lake Cave until they reach their goal: a door beyond which they must pass to
save Cron.

 One of the meanest tricks in the game is that the party of the Chosen One is
allowed to battle through the endless corridors of the Square Lake Cave and
reach their goal before they have achieved all that they must and are told to
come back some other time. Perhaps this wasn't meant as a nasty trick, but it
 !CompuServe TEG-10630

usually takes over an hour to fight all the endless monsters to reach the final
goal.

 Don't bother visiting the Square Lake Cave until after you have rescued King
Kalohn; you will be wasting your time.

 Once you have saved the King, your visit here will be worthwhile. There is one
puzzle left to solve, and it's not easy. Before you get here, you might want to
get out a dictionary and review the word "cryptogram."

 Note 1: Not all the features listed above exist in the present. Some features
may only exist on certain days. You might need to be facing a specific direction
to see some of these features. If you are at the specified location and can't
find anything, face all four directions. If you still don't see anything,
explore the squares nearby. Items followed by a character type in parentheses
indicate the item is important to the Jurors' Quest for that character type.

 Note 2: The effects of each fountain/pool/spring and food item were determined
empirically (e.g., a character used them and I noted the results.) In some
cases, there were no noticeable results. Some of the effects of these magical
waters may change with time or the previous actions of characters. Magical water
may benefit some characters but harm others. For example, a spring that changes
the level of everyone in the party to 18 is a great benefit to second level
characters, but a terrible curse for 50th level characters.

RESS TO SUCCESS

 While I was writing this walkthru, I discovered a way to raise level 6
characters to level 50 in under an h
our! Repeated applications can raise the
party to 255 (top end maximum!) in several hours. This section will tell you how
to d
o this for your party.

 Before you raise your characters to these heights, please consider that it may
ruin your enjoyment of the game. In my experience -- and the experience of other
gamers with whom I have discussed this -- this game plays best with characters
ranging in level from 20th to 40th. These levels allow you to win the battles
you need to, but force you to rely on your intelligence and cunning; at levels
higher than these, you can just use brute force to deal with any situation which
would tend to get rather boring after a while.
 !CompuServe TEG-10676


 Part of the game's response to higher level characters seems to be to increase
the number of monsters you meet in each encounter, and this eventually leads to
long boring combats; your party can wipe out a monster party consisting of six
Iron Wizards, a T. Rex, and 170 Armored Dragons, killing them all without taking
any damage. This battle could take upwards of ten minutes, and be followed by
similar encounters. While I originally enjoyed being more powerful than almost
any monster or combination of monsters, I soon realized that I had compromised
the playability of the game.

 MMII is a fun game that can be played for a long time, and I don't want to
spoil it for you with these hints (I have to admit, I felt very clever when I
discovered this!). So with that warning, read on if you like. Certainly, you
don't have to use what is presented here.

 PREPARATIONS

 For this process to work best, you need to make some preparations. You need to
find or purchase a Witch's Broom and a Teleport Orb, find the Holy Word spell
hidden in square C1, and visit Corak's Cave in C2 to learn Lloyd's Beacon.
 !CompuServe TEG-10678


 Using the Witch's Broom and the Teleport Orb, visit the Greatest Fountain which
is located in the desert in E2. Don't try to walk there or you will die;
instead, use the Orb to jump directly to the fountain. Cast a Lloyd's Beacon in
this square so that you can return here anytime you want. Now, use the Witch's
Broom to return to a town and save the game by entering an Inn.

 THE FIRST GIANT STEP

 Mr. Wizard is being held captive by a Lich and a Monster Masher in D3. Rescuing
him involves defeating the Lich and the Masher, and will provide you with
considerable experience (it jumped my characters from 6th level to 13th level).

 A Lich is an Undead Monster which can be dispelled by the Holy Word spell. Your
problems at this point are:

 1. Sixth level characters can't throw ninth level spells.

 2. Your cleric doesn't have enough spell points.

 !CompuServe TEG-10680

 3. You have to throw the spell before the Lich attacks, or you will be toasted,
and the Lich is faster than you (so is the Masher).

 4. There is no way that six sixth level characters can overcome a Monster
Masher.

 Dealing with these problems one at a time:

 1. In C1 is a fountain that temporarily allows all who drink from it to throw
9th level spells (if they know them).

 2. In C1 is a fountain that temporarily provides 200 spell points to everyone
who drinks from it.

 So you use the Broom to fly to C1, and drink from these two fountains.

 3. Use Lloyd's Beacon to return to the Greatest Fountain and drink from it.
This raises all your attribute scores -- including speed -- to 200, making you
faster than the Lich.

 !CompuServe TEG-10682

 4. The Greatest Fountain affects the amount of damage you do in a physical
attack by raising your strength to 200 (roughly equivalent to the Hulk), while
it increases your chance to hit (accuracy of 200 is impossible to describe).
When you fight the Masher you will be amazed!

 Use the Witch's Broom to fly to D3, then use the Teleport Orb to teleport to
(1,14) (don't try to walk there; if you get in a fight, you lose all your
enhancements and have to start again). Attack!

 Let everyone in your party (except the Cleric) smite the Monster Masher. I
suspect that four hits (from the Knight, Paladin, Robber, and Archer) will take
him out.

 When it's your cleric's turn, have him cast Holy Word. ZAP! The Lich is gone,
Mr. Wizard is free, grateful, and available for hire, and there is an excellent
treasure here.

 When you return home, visit the most expensive Training Center you can afford.
(I actually had to make some side trips to obtain enough gold to pay the
Training Center in order to find out my entire party was now 13th level.)
 !CompuServe TEG-10683


 The finishing touch on this step is to circle through the Towns of Cron,
visiting all of the Temples and Mages Guilds, and learning all the spells you
can afford.

 LATER, GREATER STEPS

 You can't rescue Mr. Wizard again, but at this point, with a little
preparation, you can take out the Cuisinarts!

 First, you need to learn the Dancing Sword spell. Before you leave town, visit
the Temple and make donations (option C) until the clerics bless you for the
day. Visit the Greatest Fountain and the Spell Fountains in C1, then use the
Broom to go to A2. Use the Teleport Orb (avoid encounters!) to jump to (15,11),
where you will find and fight the Mist Warrior, who you should defeat easily.
When you win this battle, you learn the Dancing Sword spell. Return home to rest
and save the game, because now we're going to chase Big Game!

 Purchase (or find) 12 units of "MaxHP Potion." Magic users can use the spell S
1-2 (Detect Magic) to see how many units each potion bottle holds.
 !CompuServe TEG-10685


 Visit your Temple and donate until you are blessed. Visit the Greatest Fountain
and the Spell Fountains, then use the Broom to take tou eo B2.

 Have every party member use two units of the MaxHP Potion, and have your
Paladin cast C 1-6 (Power Cure) on each party member in turn until he runs out
of spell points. If you have two Paladins, they should both throw spells until
they run out of points (don't use up your Cleric's spell points yet).

 At this point, you should have a Blessed Party, each of which can cast 9th
level spells, has 200 spell points each (except the Paladins), has attribute
scores of 200, and has magically extended his/her natural number of hit points.

 If your party has two Mountaineers, you can walk north through the mountains
(from the road) to (1,9). If not, use the Orb. You will encounter the
Cuisinarts. If you choose to fight, you get to go first (even if they surprise
you).

 Characters who can't throw spells should concentrate on the first Cuisinart.
Your Archer should probably shoot number 1, although using the Dancing Sword is
 !CompuServe TEG-10687

a good alternative. If your paladins have enough spell points left, they should
throw C 7-3 (Moon Ray), because while it doesn't hurt the Cuisinarts much, it
gives your party more hit points (and you will need them shortly!).

 Your Cleric should also throw Moon Ray. Your Sorcerer should throw S 8-4 (Power
Shield), which will cut damage to your party in half.

 Hopefully, the first Cuisinart is down, but he might still be standing. And now
it's their turn!

 If all three Cuisinarts frenzy, you're toast (again); however, there is a very
good chance that some of your party will be awake at the end of the round, and
also a good chance that you will all still be alive. If your Cleric is still
awake, you can save the day (well, save the second?) by throwing Moon Ray again.
Everyone who is still alive is partially cured, and you can start over.

 If your Paladin(s) or Cleric(s) is able to throw Moon Ray at the start of the
second round, you have probably already won the fight, although it may take
another round. With 13th level charaotere, this fight won't last more than three
rounds, and it will only go three rounds if you win.
 !CompuServe TEG-10689


 You may lose to the Cuisinarts in this fight. If so, come back and try it
again. If you try it two or three times, you ought to win one. As soon as you
win one fight, rest immediately, then search (don't forget to search!). Once you
have the treasure, quickly return to town and save the game. You don't want to
lose your new experience and have to do this over again!

 Once you've saved the game, visit a Training Center to reach the higher levels.
If, like me, you want to play with invincible characters, you can do the
Cuisinart cycle again.

 I went through the Cuisinart cycle twice. Actually, at this point, my party was
gaining experience points much faster than gold, so I had to stop Training to go
out and find treasure to pay for my Training. Regardless of the money problem,
my party went from 6th level to 50th level in under an hour!

 While treasure has been kind of glossed over here, you will be very happy with
the treasures the Cuisinarts hide. Things like a Silver Helmet +30, Silver
Splint Mail +23, Titan's Pike +25; many of the best treasures in the game can be
found here!
 !CompuServe TEG-10691


 Once you reach a level high enough to beat the Cuisinarts on a routine basis,
here is a method to advance even more quickly. Beat them once, turn to the west,
and take two steps. This puts you into A2. Rest (unless you already did), then
press the backup arrow twice to return to the Cuisinarts. Fight, win, search,
take two steps west, rest, take two steps east, and start again.

 Please remember my warning; you may upset the playability of the game by
becoming too high a level too quickly. But the method is there, if you want to
use it!

 POWER GOES TO MY HEAD

 There is a magical weapon called a Shaman Pipe which you can use to assist a
party of only Paladins and Archers in throwing 8th and 9th level spells. The
special power of the Pipe raises the user's Spell Level (Shaman's Pipe +1 raises
the spell level by 2). By using this power, characters normally limited to 7th
level spells can throw 9th level spells, if the spells are in their Spell Books.
And a visit to the Spell Salesman will allow these characters to put 8th and 9th
level spells in the book.
 !CompuServe TEG-10693


 Using an Archer to emulate a Robber, and Shaman's Pipes in the packs of all my
party members, I played with a party of four Paladins and four Archers. They
started at 50th level (see above), and I was able to defeat every monster in the
modern world. Eventually, there was no one and nothing they couldn't defeat in
less than three rounds, which got incredibly boring.

 Using S 9-4 (Enchant Item) and S 7-2 (Duplication), this group was outfitted
entirely in Gold Chain +50. The Paladins had Gold Helms and Gold Shields, also
+50. The Archers were equipped with Meteor Bows to increase their armor class,
and all eight carried Dark Tridents, again raising their Armor Classes.

 All of these characters had scores of 100 for each attribute (many trips to the
Circus), and used magical enhancements to raise some attributes even higher.
This was when I discovered that Attributes over 255 might cause problems when
the party tried to rest. Maximum armor class turns out to be 255, as does
maximum level. I don't know what the maximum number of hit points is, because
the game allows my characters to continue to go up in hit points at the Training
Centers, even though their levels are pegged (it's too hard to explain; if you
really want to know, drop me a message in The Gamers' Forum).

 Eventually, there was nothing left to do but fight the Mega-Dragon. We won,
although he managed to crunch King Kalohn before the party could engage him. It
was an incredibly boring fight, and the treasure was in a Silver Chest.

 Someone asked if I had enjoyed this, and I had to admit I didn't. I mostly
wanted to see what the limits of the game were, and I found out, so I guess
there is a little satisfaction there.

 What else I found out was that the game plays best with characters between 20th
and 50th level. I hope I managed to convey that message to you, because this is
a fun game if you don't mangle it!

 I hope that this guide can help users enjoy their game! Heartfelt thanks to
BigBad MaMa and Uncle Andy. Their input and encouragement made the writing of
this walkthru enjoyable, but I'm awfully glad it's done!

 1 Introduction, Character Tips
 2 Starting Out, Quests
 3 Character DevelProblem:
What's the object of this game?
Hint:
After being  forced to become  a Manhunter in  New York by  the Orb
Alliance,  You discovered  that Phil  Cook, an  Orb ally,  was a
dangerous killer. As the game  begins, Phil is escaping from New
York  in his  spaceship. You   chase him  in a  second spaceship
vowing not  to let him  get away. Having  chased him across  the
country  you crash  land in  San Francisco.  Find Phil before he
kills again, help defeat the Orbs!!
Hint:
Most clues are visual and symbolic.  You must look carefully at the
screen to determine how the clue in that screen ties in with the
rest of the  game. Take notes as you play.  Save the game often.
The game  shows you what you  are able to do,  what you can get,
and where you are able to go.
Hint:
If the cursor is an arrow, press <ENTER> to move in that direction.
If the  cursor is a  magnifying glass, press  <ENTER> to take  a
closer  look. If  your cursor  is  a  hand, you  may pick  up or
manipulate the  object by pressing  <ENTER>. If the  cursor is a
#3,  you are  in third  person perspective  and are  able to see
yourself on the screen.
Hint:
Press <F3> to travel. You will be shown a map of San Francisco. All
the locations you are authorized to investigate are indicated by
a blinking square.  The number of  locations you can  visit will
increase as the game progresses. Use your arrow keys or joystick
to position the  blue and red circle over  the location you want
to travel to and press <ENTER>.
Hint:
Press the  <TAB> key to  view your inventory  screen. Highlight the
item you wish  to use by using the up-down  arrow keys and press
<ENTER>.
Hint:
The MAD  (for Manhunter Assignment  Device) is a  personal computer
that has  two functions: INFO  and TRACKER. The  MAD is standard
equipment for all Manhunters.
Hint:
The  yellow target  is the  person you  are currently tracking. The
tracker  will allow  you to  see exactly  where your suspect has
traveled. If  more than one  person is involved  in the criminal
activity, you may  put your cursor over the  other suspect while
tracking, and quickly press <ENTER> to tag the new suspect.

Problem:
What do I do at the crash site?
Hint:
Move your cursor to the green  card on the ground. Press <ENTER> to
take the  I.D. card. Note  the name "Peter  Brown" on the  card.
Enter "Peter Brown" into your MAD. You will assume Peter Brown's
identity. Peter Brown's apartment is now yours.
Hint:
At the crash site. Move your  cursor to the rectangular blue object
on  the  ground  and  pick  it  up.  Peter  Brown was tracking a
suspect. Use  the Tracking function to  track the suspect. Watch
as the suspect travels from the bank to the warehouse, the Ferry
Building, and  the Embarcadero Fountain.  Travel to the  Bank of
Canton.

Problem:
What do I do at the Bank of Canton?
Hint:
Enter the bank  through the same door that  the suspects used. Take
the dragon note that is on  the desk. Take the newspaper that is
lying  on the  floor. Note  the  name  of the  scientist in  the
article. Look at the dead man's  left hand. Read the name on the
door as if  you were standing outside. Enter  the name into your
MAD computer.

Problem:
There is no one named "Bat Vomit" in the city!
Hint:
The name is reversed. Enter the  correct name "Tad Timov" into your
MAD. Tad  Timov is the dead  security guard that worked  for the
Bank of Canton. Your character will  be now be able to travel to
his apartment. But  first exit the bank and go  to the left. You
will find a dead body.

Problem:
What do I do with the dead body I found near the bank?
Hint:
Look at the  large bite on the victim's neck,  take the broken fang
that is lodged in his skin. Pick up the laundry receipt, look at
the tattoo on his hand. Travel to the warehouse.

Problem:
I can't get into the warehouse office!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY".  Avoid the robots. Enter the room at
the bottom-left corner of the screen.

Problem:
What do I do in the warehouse office?
Hint:
Read the  schedule message on  the wall. Take  a close look  at the
message written in blood on the  top of the desk. Note the first
names  in the  message, Zac  and Mic,  and the  contents of  the
message. Pick up the mallet  leaning against the wall and notice
the fish imprint on the end. Travel to Tad Timov's apartment.

Problem:
What should I do at Tad's apartment?
Hint:
Wait and you will be attacked by a guard dog. There is nothing else
you can do here, YET. Travel to the Ferry Building.

Problem:
What should I do at the Ferry Building?
Hint:
The doors are  locked so you cannot go in.  There is a message that
you  must look  at on  the side  of the  building. You cannot do
anything else here, YET. Travel to the Embarcadero Fountain.

Problem:
What should I do at the fountain?
Hint:
Jump in. Try to enter the pipe on the right side.

Problem:
How can I enter the pipe in the fountain?
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". You need to get into the pipe on the
right, but you keep slipping on slime. Anytime you get too close
to the drain,  press <ENTER> to spin away.  When you slide close
to the pipe opening press  <ENTER> several times until you slide
right in.

Problem:
I keep getting my face eaten by rats and bats!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". Stand  in one place as you punch and
stomp. Don't  try to move  forward yet. The  rats and bats  will
eventually stop coming. Move forward when they stop.

Problem:
What do I do in the den?
Hint:
Take the  driver's license that  is lying on  the floor. Match  the
last name, "STONE" with the first name that you read on the desk
in the  warehouse office. Enter the  name in your MAD.  Take the
empty flask. Look at the dead  creature. Read the message on the
wall.

Problem:
What is the dead creature's name in the den?
Hint:
Mic Stone. Enter Mic Stone into your MAD.

Problem:
Where do I go after I leave the den?
Hint:
Travel to the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
What do I do at the pier?
Hint:
Climb down  the ladder. Look into  the pipe on the  beach. Go under
the pier and climb the piling. Notice the hole in the pier. You
can't do anything  here for now, but you  will come back later.
Travel to the Manhunter's apartment.

Problem:
What do I do at the Manhunter's apartment?
Hint:
Look out the window to reveal various messages. Look in the dresser
drawer, take the cloth.

Problem:
What are the locations I may have missed?
Hint:
The Bank of Canton, warehouse, Ferry Building, Embarcadero Fountain
and the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
What items should I have in my robe?
Hint:
Peter  Brown's I.D.  Card, Tad  Timov's dragon  note, the newspaper
clipping, the fang, the laundry receipt, the mallet, Mic Stone's
driver's license, the empty flask,  and the cloth that says "Rub
jewel of heaven".

Problem:
Getting started on day 2.
Hint:
The Orbs gave you an assignment. Press  <F3> to travel to pier 5 to
do  some investigating.  Use the  MAD tracker  to tag  the other
suspects.

Problem:
What do I do at pier 5?
Hint:
Look at the dead creature on the boat. Take the muzzle. Compare the
broken fang with the fang that you found in front of the bank.

Problem:
What do I do with the muzzle?
Hint:
Remember when Timov's dog attacked you? Return to his apartment and
muzzle the beast. Search his place for clues.

Problem:
What do I do at Tad Timov's apartment?
Hint:
When you see  Tad's dog, select the muzzle from  your robe that you
found  on the  boat. Take  the camera.  Note the  symbols on the
tapestry on the  wall that says "Heaven Vision."  Travel to the
Temple.

Problem:
I keep getting a Ninja's throwing star in my forehead, what can I do?
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY".  Defend yourself long enough and the
Buddah will  rise, allowing you  to climb the  sectet stairs. To
make the  arcade sequence a  little easier, save  the game every
time you dodge a few Ninja stars.

Problem:
OK, I'm in the stairway, now what?
Hint:
Examine all the statues. These statues provide two important clues.
Read the dragon note. "R3" means "RIGHT 3" - Replace R3 with the
word from  the third statue  on the right.  Replace L1 with  the
word on the  first statue on the left. Replace  R4 with the word
on the  fourth statue on the  right. Look at the  cloth that you
found  in the  drawer. It  says "Rub  jewel of  Heaven." Use the
cloth  on the  Heaven statue  for another  clue. Continue up the
stairway.

Problem:
What should the decoded dragon message say?
Hint:
"The R3 is the L1 to R4" = The Castle is the Gateway to Hell.

Problem:
What does the decoded "Heaven" message say?
Hint:
F+Oar P+inches = four pinches.

Problem:
I keep falling into a pool of acid! Help!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". Stay  in the center of the bridge as
you move across. Saving the  game after making it halfway across
will make crossing easier.

Problem:
A very  big man insists  on branding dragons  onto my hand!  I need some
advice.
Hint:
Don't touch the brand. Instead, run over, grab the scroll, and jump
out the window. Once outside, run to the right before the Ninjas
get you.

Problem:
I keep getting cut in half by a Ninja!

Problem:
What do I do with the scroll, what does it mean?
Hint:
West is  not a direction,  it is a  name. Match up  the name "West"
with one of the first names that you read back at the warehouse.
Enter "Zac West" into your MAD Info.

Problem:
I'm in the room with an old man with a twitching mustache. What do I do?
Hint:
Remember  the "Heaven"  message? Select  four pinches  from the pot
with the  "Heaven" marking (second  from left). Smoke  the pipe,
watch the vision and take the statue.

Problem:
What does the vision mean?
Hint:
You saw a  vision of the old man's daughter  turning into a mutant.
Remember her face, you will need to recognize her later. Travel
to the Shop.

Problem:
I'm at the  Shop and I can't figure out  what to do.
Hint:
The morbid shopkeeper seems to be holding a finger. If you had some
body parts  to give him he  might let you try  to play cards and
win  a prize.  If you  don't have  any, leave  and travel to the
TransAmerica pyramid.

Problem:
What are all those S's in the pyramid building?
Hint:
All of the S's are slaves.

Problem:
What do I do in the pyramid building?
Hint:
Take the rifle. Free the slave that the robot is punishing. To free
the slave set the arcade mode  to "EASY". The idea is to rotate
clockwise without getting hit. Move only when the robot aims at
you.  When you  are at  the top  of the  screen, the slave will
escape. Continue to  rotate until you are at  the bottom of the
screen. Walk off the screen and travel to the doctor's house.

Problem:
What do I do at the doctor's house?
Hint:
Get the letter from the doctor's pocket. Pour the urine sample into
the  flask  that  you  found  near  the Embarcadero Fountain by
selecting the  flask from your  inventory. Travel to  the cable
car barn.

Problem:
What should I do at the cable car barn?
Hint:
Hop onto a  cable car to get inside.  You need to go to  the box in
the upper-right  corner and bump  against the right  side. Pull
the switch to  open the gate. Run through the  gate. If you are
having difficulty set the arcade mode to "EASY" and try again.

Problem:
I found the cable car, what do I do?
Hint:
Look at the posters on the side  of the cable car. Look at the dead
man on the pile of bodies in  the car. Take the letter from his
belt.  Look at  his hand.  Leave the  same way  you came in and
travel to the private club. Knock on the door.

Problem:
They won't let me into the club or the laundry!
Hint:
You can't get  into the club because it's  private. It's for ratmen
only. Come back  later when you have a  disguise. Travel to the
laundry. The  laundry is closed, come  back tomorrow. Travel to
the scientist's house.

Problem:
How can I travel to the scientist's house?
Hint:
Type the name  "Noah Goring" into your MAD. You  picked up the name
"Noah" from  the newspaper clipping, "Goring"  from the doctor's
letter.

Problem:
What do I do at the scientist's house?
Hint:
Take the matches.  Look out the window. Read  the files. Notice the
white thread. Travel to the Wax Museum.

Problem:
What do I do at the Wax Museum?
Hint:
Notice the fish that the wax  figure is holding. You found a mallet
with  a fish  on it  at the  warehouse. Use  the mallet here to
smack the fish. Look at  the three propaganda exhibits (you can
see the other two exhibits after watching the film, then moving
left). At the last exhibit, look  in the chimney. Leave the wax
museum.  Select  travel,  if  you  have  completed  all  of the
activities in  day 2 you will  be sent to your  apartment. This
ends day 2.

Problem:
Whenever I  go to the Manhunter's  apartment and try to  lay down in the
hammock, it tells me that "It's too early to go to bed". Why?
Hint:
You have not completed all of the activities in Day 2.

Problem:
What are the locations I may have missed?
Hint:
Pier 5, Tad Timov's apartment, the Temple, the Temple stairway, the
Ninja initiation room, the room with  the old man and the smoke,
the  shop, the  TransAmerica building,  the doctor's  house, the
cable car barn, Noah Gorings house, and the Wax Museum.

Problem:
What additional items should I have in my robe?

Hint:
Zac West and Noah Goring.
Hint:
The additional items  you should have are, the  camera, the scroll,
the statue, the rifle, letter #1, letter #2, the full flask, and
the matches.

Problem:
Where should I go first?
Hint:
Travel to  the  laundry.  You  will  see  a  girl. Move towards the
girl. Give the girl the laundry receipt. When she winks at you,
follow her. It's a trap... but you must fall for it.

Problem:
I was clubbed and came to in the dark, what now?
Hint:
The slave you freed released you. Take the walking stick. Leave the
laundry and travel to Ghirardelli Square and investigate.

Problem:
What should I do at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Get the rat's paw. Then travel to the shop.

Problem:
What do I do at the shop?
Hint:
Give the  man at the  counter the rat's  paw. He will  let you play
cards. Find  the ace three times.  Don't take a prize  yet, play
and find  the ace three more  times. When he offers  you a prize
this time, select the mask on the left.

Problem:
I can't beat this guy at the card game.
Hint:
Set  the arcade  mode to  "EASY". Watch  carefully, he's  trying to
trick you with a false shuffle. To beat that con, save the game
as soon  as the shuffle is  completed, then choose the  ace. If
you're wrong, just  restore the game. After you  leave the shop
travel to the private club.

Problem:
I still can't get into the club.
Hint:
Get as close as you can to the door. Wear the mask and knock on the
door.

Problem:
What do I do at the club?
Hint:
Get as close as you can to the door. Wear the mask and knock on the
door.  When  the  ratman  shows  you  the  arm, note the symbols
tattoed on  it. Play dice. When  the ratmen get mad  at you give
them the flask. While they are fighting over the flask, grab the
hatchet and leave. Travel to Ghirardelli Square again.

Problem:
What do I do this time at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Try to climb up the sign to the man hanging up there. You will need
to get  the ring that  is hanging around  his neck. If  you have
difficulty climbing the sign set the arcade mode to "EASY".

Problem:
I keep getting zapped by the guy with the shocking personality.
Hint:
Don't touch  him. Use the walking  stick to take the  ring from his
neck.

Problem:
Anything else I should do at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Go into  the window in the  tower. When you reach  the gate, take a
close look.

Problem:
My flask keeps breaking while I'm at Ghirardelli Square!
Hint:
Go back  to the private club  and find the proper  time to give the
flask away.

Problem:
How do I open the gate?
Hint:
Notice that the  pattern on the lock is the  same as the ring. Open
the lock with the ring.

Problem:
Ok, I've opened the gate and now I've got real trouble!

Problem:                 
I've return to the Wax Museum and don't know what to do.
Hint:
Investigate where  both suspects went.  There is fresh  meat on the
pile of bodies in exhibit  #2. Examine Noah Goring carefully. Go
into  the fireplace  in the  last exhibit.  When done  leave the
museum. Travel to the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
I've found Noah Goring, but I don't know what to do with him.
Hint:
Use the fang to cut the white thread on his tie. Take the card.

Problem:
What do I do at the Hyde Street Pier.
Hint:
Go  under the  pier. Climb  up the  piling. Use  the hatchet to cut
through the bottom of the crate. Hide in the crate.

Problem:
How do I get out of the crate?
Hint:
Use the hatchet.

Problem:
The mutants keep stomping me!
Hint:
Look at  the mutant in  the second cell,  middle row. That's  Ming.
Remember her from the vision you saw after smoking the pipe with
her father? Give her the statue.

Problem:
How do I free the mutants?
Hint:
Insert the  Orb card that you  found in Noah Goring's  tie into the
cell door-access  machine. Fool the camera  into thinking you're
and Orb by using the Orb-On-A-Stick.

Problem:
How do I escape?
Hint:
Use the balloon.

Problem:
How do I use the balloon?
Hint:
Turn on  the gas, light the  gas with the matches  you found at the
scientist's house.

Problem:
Where do I land?
Hint:
Land at Julius Castle.

Problem:
I'm in the control room and confused. What do I do?
Hint:
Take a closer look at the  controls. Close all of the gates. Select
the ROBOT button  - move all of the robots  to the lowest sensor
square in the center. Select the  SLAVE button - move all of the
slaves into Slavery.  Select the LAVA button -  open the gate on
the  bottom right  to flood  the robots.  Open the bottom center
gate to flood the cable car barn. Open the gate next to the lava
in the  second row down,  center to flood  the pyramid and  Coit
Tower.  Watch as  the mutants  turn into  people again. Move the
slaves into Hell.

Problem:
I'm at Freedom. How do I use the digger?
Hint:
When you are in  the digger, punch in the code that  you saw on the
severed arm. Press the START button.

Problem:
What is the code for the digger?
Hint:
UNNC

Problem:
I can't make it through the lava maze!
Hint:
Set the  arcade mode to  "EASY". Save the  game often. You  need to
reach the  Ferry Building in  the upper-right corner  of the far
upper-right section.

Problem:
The lava maze is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE!
Hint:
We have a map of the lava maze available and would be happy to mail
it to you. Leave a message for Customer Service on this BBS. You
may  also  obtain  the  lava  map  by  writing or calling Sierra
On-Line's Customer Service Department.

MIGHT AND MAGIC 1

     Part 1

 This walkthru is designed to assist you in finding the
Inner Sanctum in Varn. There is much to explore and find in
Varn and many puzzles to figure out. It should be noted that
you will need at least 54 sheets of graph paper to map all
the game. I used a composition book that had quadrille
(graph) sheets, and it was very helpful. Copies of the
mapping sheet they give you in the book are also very good.

 CHARACTER CREATION

 In general, follow the guidelines in the documentation.
Make sure, though, that all your characters have good END
and that your wizard has SPEED of at least 15. If you can be
patient enough, all characters should have also have
ACCURACY over 11. Having a Cleric with low SPEED can be
helpful, since he/she will go last in melee and be able to
cure folks who have been injured during the round. There is
an advantage in having all female characters, but if you
don't care for that, it's not mandatory. There also can be
an advantage in having characters all the same alignment.
You should have a character in each character class. Keep in
mind that all of your characters can be in melee, so you
don't want to have many (like wizards) that are vulnerable.

 SORPIGAL

 You begin the game in the Inn of Sorpigal. A map of
Sorpigal is provided in the documentation, but this is by no
means complete. Explore there thoroughly and keep good
notes. Do not go outside of Sorpigal until you are at least
3rd level; there's lots to explore, and the monsters will be
at least a match for you. Try to move through all walls,
since there are hidden doors that can only be discovered
this way. Make sure you find the Leprechaun, he's your easy
ticket to the other four cities of Varn. He's behind a
hidden door, close to the exit to the outside at x11,y3. Be
aware that there is no Leprechaun in any other city, so
you'll have to walk back. Don't go to City #4 (Dusk) until
you've gotten the FLY Spell. Also behind a hidden door is
the statue of a frog (x14,y14). He will tell you in areas
like him (black and white checked) you will find what you
need to help Og. The Og quest is not vital to the completion
of the game, but like many other quests, it adds depth (and
points to your final score).

 The monsters will give about 40-80 experience points per
battle, and since you need approximately 2000 to go up a
level, it will be slow going. Make sure you cast your
Leather Skin Spell after resting and before adventuring. In
fact, throughout the game, always cast any Protection spell
available to you. Avoid Sprites -- they cast curses which
make it very difficult to hit them or any other monster with
them. When trying to open chests, don't bother with the
Detect Magic spell, it's not necessary. Opening chests can
severely damage or kill members in your party. If you have
anyone in the party who is unconscious, REST before opening
a chest.

 When buying food, make sure everyone has at least 5 gold.
Food prices vary from city to city, but Sorpigal is the
least expensive place to buy food in Varn. If you make
donations to the temple, you will eventually be awarded with
all of the Protection spells cast at their highest possible
level. They will go away when you rest, but they can still
be very helpful. Temple donation prices also vary from town
to town. The bars are a good source of information, make
sure you have a drink from time to time.

 There are caverns below Sorpigal and if your characters are
2nd/3rd level, they should be able to explore them safely.
Be sure to get the vellum scroll from the wizard; he will
tell you to deliver it to a wizard in Erliquin.

 EXPLORING

 I have designed this as a reference work, since you can be
doing many things at any given time. A "walkthru" just isn't
possible with this game. First will be a list of the areas
and what can be found in them, and then will be a list of
significant places and items and where they can be found.
Assume that any location listed is accessible by the
ETHERIALIZE or TELEPORT spells unless noted. There are many
places (not mentioned in this walkthru) where magic doesn't
work. Generally speaking, it won't be over a wide area, but
be very careful of using a transportation spell to get to a
place where magic doesn't work, and then resting, since you
will not be able to cast the spell to get back.

 CITIES

 Sorpigal is Town #1.

 Portsmith (Town #2; B3 x3,y3): This city is tough on male
characters, and if you didn't follow my advice, and have
some in your party, you might consider exploring the cave
below Portsmith for the fountain that reverses the sex of
your characters. Zam is in Portsmith, and so is the
Succubus. Zam is hidden behind a door at x11,y0. The
succubus is hidden behind a door at x10,y4. Do not enter
that door unless your characters are at least 15th level,
since there is no way out, and the Succubus and her
accompanying devils are very tough. There are stairs down to
a cave at x0,y8.

 Algary (Town #3; D4 x7,y7): Behind the Inn in Algary is the
Swaze Pit. The Swaze Pit is nothing but unending encounters,
so it is a good place to take your characters for experience
points. There are also a couple of Portals that take you to
various dungeons. Go through them if you'd like, but they
aren't the only way to get to the dungeons.

 Dusk (Town #4; E1 x9,y11): Telengar (the person the wizard
in Erliquin told you to deliver the scroll to) is at x8,y0.
The Forbidden Crypt contains a bunch of pretty nasty
monsters, but at the end of it, you'll find an undead
amulet, useful for casting Turn Undead. Food is very
expensive here (200gp for 40 food), so make sure you have a
lot of food before you come. Donations to the temple, on the
other hand, are quite cheap (25gp) so this is a good place
to get all those helpful spells. There are stairs leading
down to a dungeon at x14,y0.

 Erliquin (Town #5; B1 x13,y1): The wizard Agar is hidden
behind the Inn at x2,y5. The Town Treasure is at x15,y6. If
you steal it, you will be accosted by guards. The guards are
very very tough; so unless you are level 20+, don't try to
fight them. If you give in, you will get a jail sentence
that will age your characters that many years. Really, the
treasure isn't worth it.

 MIGHT AND MAGIC
     Part 2

 OUTDOORS

 A1: The passage to Castle Doom is at x7,y15. You'll need
the gold key to finish up Castle Doom. There is a Pool of
Health at x12,y1 which grants +2 to END. In the forests
around x5,y2, you can fight the Dark Rider. He is the one
who can help you improve the payoff on the Wheel of Luck.

 A2: The Pirate's Secret Cove is at x2,y4 and at x2,y5
(there are two of them). The Dragon's Tooth is at x11,y3.
The King's Pass is at x0,y15 (can't FLY to that area).

 A3: x3,y6 the Wheel of Luck. There are 4 monsters shown on
the map: the Sea Serpent, the Scorpion, the Dark Rider, and
the Dragon. The more monsters you kill, the better you will
do when spinning the wheel. They are in the areas shown on
the map, but precise locations aren't possible, since they
can move.

 A4: bridge at x4,y6. At that bridge, Gypsies' (found in C2)
colors will be asked for. If you answer correctly (at least
3 members of party), walk across to x4,y2 and get the coral
key. An incorrect answer will eradicate a character, so be
careful. You cannot teleport and get the key.

 B1: Silver Key at x4,y7. You must enter the passage to the
key from x0,y6. Erliquin is at x13,y1. Blackridge Castle
South is at x11,y2. Blackridge Castle North is at x14,y10.
The Ancient Ruins are at x12,y5. To get to the Ancient Ruins
you must use the Slide from inside Blackridge South Castle
or find the teleport that goes from one side of Erliquin's
dungeon to the other. There is a backdoor to Erliquin at
x14,y1, accessible from one of the Algary portals.

 B2: There is the riddle of the Ice Princess at x4,y4. The
answer to the riddle is LOVE. Search after giving the
answer, and you will get a key. Answer the riddle twice, and
you will get a second key. The first should be bronze and
the second diamond. The Warrior's Stronghold (Raven's Lair)
is at x9,y9. A cave is at x8,y4.

 B3: Portsmith is at x3,y3. Enchanted Forest Stronghold
(also called the Minotaur's Stronghold) is at x14,y2. It is
difficult to get there, so keep experimenting. Wolf Castle
is at x9,y13. Wizard Ranalou's cave is at x0,y7. Blyth's
Peak is at B3 x9,y6.

 B4: Trivia Island is at the southern part of the map.
Normally you must pay 500 gold, but there is a place at
x15,y15 where you can pull the lever and then no payment is
required. The questions and answers:

 Who is the voluptuous one? Laura

 Who's lost sight? Og

 Where's the very latest? Erliquin

 Who be ye? I be me

 You'll get 50 gems for answering each question correctly.

 C1: If you have gotten the clues from Zom and Zam, at
x15,y15 search, and you'll find a ruby whistle, necessary to
enter the Enchanted Forest Stronghold. You must stay alive
between talking to Zom and Zam and searching for the key;
otherwise you, the player, will have the clues, but your
characters won't. There are six fountains from x10,y14
through x5,y14. The first, fourth, fifth, and sixth
fountains are poison -- don't drink from them. The second
fountain will give your spell casters all the appropriate
spells (including level 7) for their class. The third
fountain will add to the MIGHT of all the characters that
drink. If your party is less than level 12 or so, these
fountains will be necessary to battle the ambushes at the
Merchant's Wagons. The effects of the fountains wear off
after resting. One of the Merchant's Wagon's will contain a
merchant's pass, necessary to completely explore the
castles. The Merchant's Wagons are in the forested area
between x6,y5, x9,y5, x9,y9 and x6,y9. You may have to
conquer several ambushes before finally finding the pass;
however, the actual pass is located at x3,y8.

 C2: Sorpigal is at x10,y10. There is a toothless Gypsy seer
at x9,y11. Make sure each character talks to her, and write
down what she tells you. It'll be necessary to finish the
game. There is a cave at x15,y11. The only entrance to
Raven's Lair (in B2) is at x0,y2 guarded by statues that
will come to life. At x15,y8 there will be an avalanche that
will block your return.

 C3: Wyvern's Eye at x7,y7. The wyverns are tough for young
characters, but they provide great experience when you are
strong enough to take them on. Approach x8,y0 from the west.
The clue given pertains to the Og problem. There is an old
hermit at x2,y10. He will trade with you, but make sure your
character in the first slot doesn't have anything valuable
in his/her pack because the hermit will take it. You'll get
a couple of items for pirates from him. The exiled Lord
Kilburn is at x6,y14. He's past a few hidden doors. He will
give you a map of the desert.

 C4: Jolly Raven Shipwreck x8,y13. Portal at x13,y13 sends
you to the bottom of City of Gold Dungeon (E4 4th level).
Volcanic island: You need the coral key to enter cave at
x7,y2.

 D1: This is mostly desert. Make sure you have plenty of
food or the food spell available before trying to walk
across. Also, make sure you have the map of the desert
(found in C3), since without it, you'll be lost. The
tradesmen of the desert are found at x10,y13. The goods they
give you not only are a quest, but will replenish your food
supply. Scorpions may be found in the desert here.

 D2: Pool of Personality (+2 or +4) at x10,y12. Three
clerics heal curses, and conditions. Message at x9,y10.

 D3: Man at x0,y2. See him before climbing all trees. There
are 19 trees. If you climb all without leaving the area, you
get a choice of gold, gems, or a magic item, The magic items
can be wonderful. Cave at x7,y13.

 D4: Og at x7,y1. You must have the two idols (the ruby idol
is not one of them), otherwise he won't talk to you. The
answer to his question is Queen to King's level 1. Algary is
at x7,y7

 E1: Dusk at x9,y11. Castle Dragadune ruins at x12,y12.
Sands of Time (makes your characters younger) at x3,y3 and
guarded by some prehistoric uglies. Statue of Judgement at
x9,y12. You must have encountered the prisoners in the
castles before the Statue of Judgement will give you
experience points (more about this in the Castles section).

 E2: Oasis at x3,y11. There is an alien at x3,y11. Different
things will happen depending on what you choose; so be nice.
At x3,y13 get intellect raised.

 E3: x12,y6 a password is requested. To get the password, go
to x7,y2 and listen to the harper. After getting the
password, you can enter King Alamar's castle at x14,y7. A
diamond door is located at x1,y4. Beyond it is the Astral
Plane.

 E4: caves at x10,y5, This is the Building of Gold. Dragon
City Town Meeting at x8,y5. DO NOT interrupt the meeting
unless you are level 25+. This is a VERY tough fight. There
are a couple of interesting items at x2,y6 and x3,y6.

 CASTLES

 In every castle you will find a silver message. The
interleaf to explain these messages can be found in Castle
Doom. Also in every castle, you'll find a prisoner. The
amount of experience points that you get at the Statue of
Judgement will depend on your treatment of those prisoners
and each character's alignment. Keep in mind that the type
of prisoner and what you do to it will affect the experience
points. For example, if a good character lets a demon go,
that will be counted against him/her, even though letting a
chained prisoner go might be considered a good deed. Also,
the only one who gains from just leaving is a neutral
character.

 QUESTS

 All castles except Dragadune contain Lords that will send
you on quests. There are only a few quests that you must
complete in order to finish the game, but all quests give
experience points and are a good way to explore the world of
Varn. If a quest is inconvenient or too difficult, cast
Remove Quest and come back to it at a better time. In order
to see the Lords, you must have a merchant's pass (in order
to see Lord Alamar you must have a merchant's pass and a
King's pass) found in C1. Make sure that any items that the
Lords request are in the first character's back pack,
otherwise the Lord won't acknowledge that you've finished
the quest.

 Blackridge North (B1 x14,y10): Prisoner at x12,y2. Gold
message at x9,y5. Lord Inspectron is the Lord of this castle
and the following are the quests he'll send you on and how
to complete the quests:

 1. Find Ancient Ruins in Quivering Forest: B1 x12,y5. Use
the slide found in Blackridge South Castle or enter through
the caverns of Erliquin.

 2. Visit Blythe's Peak and report: B3 x9,y6 and return.

 3. The people of the desert have much to trade. Bring me a
sample of their goods: D1 x10,y13. Make sure when you trade,
the first character has nothing of value in the first slot
of his/her pack.

 4. Find the Shrine of Oskar in the caves below Dusk: In
Dusk take the stairs at x14,y0. The Shrine is at x0,y15.

 5. Find the fabled fountain in Dragadune: Dragadune is at
E1 x12,y12. The fountain exchanges gold for experience
points and is located at x13,y15.

 6. Solve the Riddle of the Ruby: Warrior's Stronghold at B2
x9,y9. Difficult to get to. The riddle is at x7,y11 in the
middle of the room. The answer is crystal, and giving the
correct answer will get you a crystal key.

 7. Defeat the Stronghold in the Enchanted Forest: The
Stronghold is at B3 x14,y2. You will not be able to do this
quest unless you have delivered the scroll to the wizards,
talked to Zom and Zam, and gotten the Ruby whistle. Assuming
you have the whistle, blow it the appropriate number of
times and then head for the stairs located at x1,y12 or
x14,y12. Go down, and you'll have to find the Minotaur,
located at x8,y14. Trying to map your way to the Minotaur is
a nightmare; so if you have the Etherealize spell, use it
instead. Kill the Minotaur (as with the Succubus, below, a
retreat will be enough to fulfill the quest) and then go to
x3,y4. DO NOT desecrate the doggie; if you search after
answering the question, you will get a gold key. If after
having done all this, you don't get a gold key, you have a
buggy copy and will have to repeat the visit to Zom and Zam,
kill the Minotaur again and then visit the dog a second
time. If that doesn't work, try using the original D disk
that came with the game instead of a copy; otherwise, you'll
have to write Activision for a new disk. You must get the
gold key to finish the game.

 Castle Blackridge South: Prisoner at x13,y2. Slide at
x11,y11 (enter dark area at x3,y11). Silver message at
x15,y7. Lord Hacker is the Lord of this castle and the
following are the quests he'll send you on and how to
complete the quests:

 1. Bring garlic: found in Sorpigal Blacksmith store.

 2. Bring wolfsbane: found in Algary.

 3. Bring belladonna: found in Blacksmith's store in Dusk.

 4. Bring head of Medusa: Caves in B2 located at x8,y4. The
head is located at x15,y3.

 5. Bring eye of Wyvern: C3 x7,y7. Defeat the Wyverns for
the eye.

 6. Dragon's Tooth: A2 x11,y3. Defeat the Dragons for the
tooth.

 7. Bring ring of Okrim: B1 x13y5 level 1 x12y12. Defeat
Okrim to get the ring.

 If you ask Lord Hacker for an 8th quest, you will lose all
in your backpacks and wind up on the Astral Plane.

 Wolf Castle: Prisoner at x12,y4. Silver message at x0,y1.
Lord Ironfist is the Lord of this castle and the following
are the quests he'll send you on and how to complete the
quests:

 1. Find stronghold in Raven's Wood: B2 x9,y9.

 2. Find Lord Kilburn: C3 x6,y14.

 3. Find the secret of Portsmith: The succubus, Portsmith,
x10,y4. You don't have to actually defeat her; you will
still succeed in the quest if you successfully retreat. It
is truly best to have no male members in the party in this
quest.

 4. Find the Pirate's secret cove: A2 x2,y4.

 5. Find the Shipwreck of the Jolly Roger: C4 x8,y13.

 6. Defeat the Pirate's Ghost Ship, Anarchist. B4 moves
around the Western part of ocean.

 7. Defeat stronghold in Raven's Wood: B2 x9,y9 second level
x14,y1. Lord Archer. If you succumb to his demands,you've
defeated him. Don't go with any gold.

 Ruins of Castle Dragadune: Prisoner at x14,y1. Silver
message at x10,y3. There is no Lord of this castle. You can
have all your gold turned into experience points at x13,y15.
At x1,y1, all those who are worthy are granted +2 luck. At
x5,y5 you find the answer to one of the "Trivia" questions.
Dragadune is a bit unusual in that it is the only castle
with multiple levels. The stairs down to level 2 (20' under)
are located at x4,y10 (you will need Etherialize to use
these stairs) and at x7,y15. You can also get into and out
of this level at x0,y0. This takes you to the dungeon below
Dusk (x15,y12). There is not much on this level but a
message about the Clerics of the South being below. Stairs
down are at x8,y15. The third level contains some VERY tough
monsters and some of the most confusing mapping problems in
the game. Fighting through is worth it, however, since at
x0,y12 you find the Clerics of the South. They will ask you
to find the three tones. If you find them and come back the
Clerics will bless you. Their blessing allows you to return
to the 7 places in the game that increase your stats and
they will be increased again! There are 6 places where the
tones appear (they move around, and so will you) they are;
x0,y6; x0,y8; x6,y0; x8,x0; x15,y6; x15,y8.

 Mount Doom: Prisoner at x1,y14. Silver message at x1,y1. If
you don't have the gold key, don't enter the spiral. The
interleaf for the silver messages is at x15,y0. The
interleaf for the gold messages is at x15,y15. To solve the
clues, line up the 6 silver messages in order of the
interleaf. Read from top to bottom one letter at a time.
When you reach the bottom go to the next column. This will
tell you all the places in the game to raise stats. Gold
interleaf: line up all 9 gold messages in order of the
interleaf. Read each word from top to bottom. This tells you
how to finish the game. If you do have the gold key, enter
the spiral at x4,y3 (hidden door). You will have to map
carefully since there are three spaces to which you must
jump to get to the center. At the center will be King
Alamar, who will give you an Eye of Goros and instruct you
to confront the false King Alamar with the Eye.

 Castle Alamar: Prisoner at x2,y2. Silver message at x7,y13.
To properly explore this castle, you will need the King's
pass (found in A2) and the Eye of Goros (found in Mount
Doom). If you don't have the right items, King Alamar will
send you on a quest that cannot be solved. Assuming you have
the right items, confront the King with the Eye of Goros. He
will turn into a demon, and throw you into the Soul Maze. To
get out, you must find out the demon's name. His name is
Sheltem and is spelled out by the white walls in the
dungeon. After doing that, you will be cleared to enter the
Inner Sanctum.

 MIGHT AND MAGIC
     Part 3

 CAVERNS AND DUNGEONS

 Gold messages are found in dungeons. I will first describe
the dungeons found under cities and then the ones outdoors.
Algary has no dungeon underneath it.

 Sorpigal caverns: Steps up/down at x14,y0. Pick up vellum
scroll at x1,y2. Nothing else of note.

 Portsmith dungeon: Steps up/down at x8,y0. Bronze door at
x8,y2 (you'll need the bronze key to enter). Do not disturb
the Demons in Conference (x8,y7) unless you can take the
Succubus upstairs, these guys will eat your lunch. The
bronze key can be found in B2. Fountain at x11,y15 reverses
the sex of each character. As you have found out upstairs,
males are drained in Portsmith. The best way to solve this
problem is to leave your ladies at the inn and have the
gents come down to this pool. If you have only 1 or 2 men,
you may want to reverse the ladies first, then go back to
the inn and reverse the whole party. The fountain at x4,y13
is poison, and the one at x0,y11 causes disease. There is a
treasure pool at x5,y11, and for those who are worthy, they
can get +2 might at x0,y12. There is a portal at x0,y0 that
will send you to the dungeon under Erliquin (20' under,
x2,y7)

 Dusk Caves: Steps up/down at x14,y0. There are a lot of
traps in this cave, also make sure you have the Psychic
Protection spell going before entering, Levitation won't
hurt either. At x14,y5, there is a flame of agility that
will grant those who are worthy +2 speed. To get there,
enter the secret door at x12,y5. Gold message at x2,y5.
Prism will grant those who are worthy +2 Accuracy at
x15,y15. At x15,y12 you will find a passage that will take
you to 20' below Dragadoon. At x0,y15 is the Shrine of
Ozark. At x2,y5 is a gold message that will allow you to
turn off the flame barriers under Erliquin. There are 3
portals in this dungeon. The first, at x9,y1, will take you
to the Wizard Ranalou's cave in B3. The one at x11,y1 will
take you to the Cave of the Magic Square in D3. The last at
x13,y1 will send you to the cave at B2 x8,y4.

 Erliquin Caves: Steps up/down at x0,y7. There are two
teleports to look for -- one at x0,y5, and one at x15,y5.
These will teleport you back and forth between the two sides
of the dungeon (and you can go out the back door at x15,y7).
There is a request for an access code at x4,y9 that will
allow you to turn off the fire barriers. The code is
YICU2ME3 and is found under Dusk. There are quite a few
minor treasures found around the rest of the dungeon that
will be useful to newer characters.

 Below Castle Dragadune (10 ft): stairs up to Dragadune at
x4,y10. Gold message at x13,y12. 20 ft below: stairs up to
10 ft level at x4,y14.

 B1 Caves: Ancient Ruins at x12,y15. Chess piece at x0,y15,
but you must go down to the second level and then come back
up again to find it. Stairs down to next level at x0,y6.
Second level: *Tough* to map. Gold message at x12,y13.
Stairs at x15,y6.

 B2 Caves (2 sets): First entrance at x8,y4. Medusa's head
at x15,y3. There are basilisks here, so be careful!

 Warrior's Stronghold entrance at x9,y9. This is also known
as Raven's Lair. To get to the cave, go North at x10,y5 then
go two east, one north, west, north, west, north and finally
west again. Riddle at x6,y11 (in the middle of the room).
The answer is crystal, and will give you a crystal key. At
x1,y5 you will find a silver door for which you will need a
silver key. If you get to that point, you will need
Etherialize to get out. The stairs down are at x8,y1. There
are some very tough monsters on level 2. Along the west wall
(at y6,9 and 12) you will be bombarded by boulders (you can
jump over these squares). Up at x6,y14 you will start a
series of 4 tests (trial by combat); however, mastering
these bad guys will still leave you short of the goal as
there are really 5 tests. You get to the 5th test through a
secret door at x3,y4. You have to jump across the conveyor
belt (x14,y4-14) to the button at x15,y4. Push the button.
Go to x14,y1. Hope you survive. You have just met Lord
Raven. If you surrender, he will let you live but will take
all your gold. Try Power Shield on him if you have it.

 B3 Caves (2 sets): Entrance at x0,y6. You will need to jump
a couple of spaces. The first time you get to a block, jump
2 times without pause. To get to the Wizard Ranalou, do not
search for secret doors, just follow the passageway. The
Wizard, along with passages to each of the castles, is at
x5,y15. If you do search for secret doors, you will be
transported to another part of the same dungeon.

 Minotaur's Stronghold: Entrance at x14,y2. Exit at x8,y8.
Must have the Ruby Whistle to enter. Gold message at
x10,y15. Stairs down to the next level at x14,y12 and
x1,y12.

 Second level Minotaur's Stronghold: Entrances to the
Minotaur's Maze at x9,y3, x8,y3, x7,y3 and x6,y3. If you
don't have the Etherealize spell yet (or want to conserve
spell points), go north at x7,y4 for 3 spaces (not counting
your starting place), then 1 space east, 2 spaces north, 1
space west, 1 space north, 2 spaces west, 2 spaces north, 2
spaces east, and north through the door. The minotaur is at
x9,y14. There is a doggie at x3,y4. There is a gold message
at x10,y4.

 C2 Caves: Entrance at x15,y11. A button to turn off the
slides is at x11,y7.

 C4 Caves: Need Coral key to enter. There is a dial to set
the teleports at x6,y3 and x8,y3. The setting is BJ. The
girl at x5,y0 will give you a clue to the setting as will
the doggie in the Minotaur's Den. Once you've set the dial,
all teleport squares will teleport you to the Volcano god.
The god is at x7,y11. He will give you a key card. You will
need this card to finish the game.

 D3 Caves: These are the magic square caves. First, do not
change the number of any of the polyhedrons that aren't
spinning already. Here are the numbers to which the
polyhedrons must be set:

 x2,y14: 16
 x6,y14: 3
 x10,y14: 2
 x14,y14:13
 x2,y10: 5
 x6,y10: 10
 x10,y10: 11
 x14,y10: 8
 x2,y6: 9
 x6,y6: 6
 x10,y6: 7
 x14,y6: 15
 x2,y2: 4
 x6,y2: 15
 x10,y2: 14
 x14,y2: 1

 After setting the polyhedrons properly, pull the lever at
x0,y15. You will then get +2 Int, +20 gems, +200 gold, and
+2000 Experience points. (Note that the numbers equal 34 if
you add them up vertically, horizontally and/or diagonally).

 E3 Caves: Entrance at x1,y4 is beyond the Diamond Door. You
will need the Diamond key to get here. This is the Astral
Plane. All of the walls of this plane are invisible. You
must carefully map your way around them to the 5 portals.
Entering the portals will send you back to Sorpigal, but if
your wizard has level 7 spells, cast 7-1 and you will be
right back. After you have found all 5 portals (they are
numbered), your key card will work on the Inner Sanctum.
Enter and gain your reward!

 E4 Caves: Entrance at x10,y5. Stairs down to next level at
x1,y3 and at x13,y4. There is another stairway at x13,y5
that goes directly to level 3. The Gold message #7 is at
x8,y13. There is a Crystal Grate at x13,y2 for which you
will need the crystal key. Second level: stairs down to
third level at x0,y3. There is not much else on the Second
level except along the bottom are some increasingly
difficult monsters that you could try. The third level is a
bit of a challenge to map and to fight through, but you will
find nothing of great import here. There are no stairs down
from the 3rd to the 4th levels. The fourth level can only be
entered directly from the surface (C4 x13,y13). Fourth level
(40 ft under the surface), there is a chess piece at x0,y15
guarded by dragons. The stairs up are at x13,y4.

An introduction to the Might and Magic II SPOILER:
(spoilers)

Hello all you M&M2 fans out there that still have problems solving M&M2!  
Following is the almost complete walkthrough for this great game.  I hope it 
will solve all your problems so you can finish the game.  However, side 
problems that do not belong to the main solution, are mostly omitted, and 
as a matter of fact I myself haven't solved them all.  After you have used 
this spoiler in whole or just parts of it, I would appreciate if you could e-
mail me your comments.  My Usenet address is:
brl@kopasker.is
Now go and have fun!
       Regards,   Bjorgvin R. Leifsson  Grundargardur 5

MIGHT & MAGIC II walkthrough
 
General informations:
You start at the inn of the town Middlegate with 6 prerolled or your own 
characters.  I myself used the characters that came with the game and put 
them in this order:
Sir Felgar (knight) - Terwin III (paladin) - Sure Valla (archer) - The Hermit 
(robber) - Gene Eric (cleric) - Cassandra (sorcerer).  When I got hirelings I 
put them in slots 3 and 4 unless clerics and sorcerers which I put in slots 5 
and 6.
M&M2 contains 60 16x16 square mazes, which are divided in 5 towns and 
their caverns, 20 outdoor mazes, 4 castle mazes, 6 castle dungeon mazes, 16 
caves and the 4 elemental mazes.  To help you get around and raise your 
character's abilities, be sure to take advantage of the secondary skills.  
When you get hirelings, take notice of their skills, so you can change those 
of your characters if you want to.  Remember to MAP everything and write 
down any hint you get during your progress plus the exact location of 
these.  Also note, that drinks and food recipes can sometimes offer much 
help if you use them properly.  Remember to check in at an inn to save 
your status if you get new vital information or complete a task and so on.  
Some hints are more important than others like hints on special battles, 
interleaves, keys and a few more.
 
1. Middlegate - the beginning.
Start exploring Middlegate.  Go to the blacksmith and equip your 
characters.  Be sure to equip the fighters first.  Find the locations of the 
tavern, Otto Mapper, Track and trail, Edmund's expeditions (the last three 
provide some vital secondary skills), Lock and key, the temple, the mage 
guild, the training hall and the Arena.  Raise your characters up to level 
three by fighting and then visit Nordon at 10,2.  Accept his quest and go to 
the cavern at 8,15.  In this cavern are many clues and hints, but to solve 
Nordon's quest you need to go to 0,7.  Return the goblet to Nordon and get 
your reward.  Follow his advice and visit his sister Nordonna at 1,2.  Accept 
her quest as well and resque Sir Hyron and Drog in the cavern at 0,15.  
Return to Nordonna to learn about your first hirelings and the secrets of 
the well at 15,15.  Follow her advices.  It is up to you if you want to take 
the hirelings before or after donating at each of the five temples (don't 
forget the temple at Middlegate) but note that if you rest with the hirelings 
you have to pay them.  After getting the castle key (which is vital to get 
into the castles, give it to your robber) you are ready for next town.  Of 
course you should finish exploring Middlegate and its cavern first.
 
2.  Sandsobar
Here you should begin finding the usual places - the blacksmith, the inn, 
the tavern, the training hall, the temple and the mage guild.  Here are also 
good secondary skills for your robber.  Explore the slums carefully and note 
hints about Nature's day (of course you can spare a dime for some poor 
beggars, don't you).  Don't worry about the graffiti at 11,3.  You can explore 
the cavern at this point if you like but perhaps you'll need more strength to 
finish it.  When you have had enough of this town for now its time for 
Tundara.
 
3.  Tundara
Start as usual finding the same places as before.  A little wall-bunching is 
needed to find all the locations.  You can try your strength against the 
frozen animals if you like but don't go to the region between the inner and 
outer wall yet unless you are suicidal.  Of course you can try your luck at 
the cavern.
 
4.  Vulcania
Here are some good secondary skills for your fighters.  As before, this is 
mainly a exploratory trip but don't forget the statues at the town square.  I 
wouldn't go to the cavern without the Levitation spell if I were you.
 
5.  Atlantium
Don't waste your hard earned money - this is an expensive town!  Later, 
when you have earned so much that you don't know what to do with it you 
can take advantage of some fine secondary skills and so on but at this 
moment you should look at the statuaries located at the east and west 
walls.  The cavern is not meant for beginners!
 
6.  Your first trip to the outer world
Now you are ready to start exploring the outer world.  I strongly 
recommend you start from Middlegate with 2 characters equipped with the 
secondary skills Mountaineer and Pathfinder.  A crusader and a navigator 
could also come handy.  When you leave town you will first meet your 
guardian pegasus and hopefully will discover his name later (it is not vital 
but try to take a linguist to C3).  If you have done as I told you and written 
down all hints you will be now know what you want to look for this time.  
(Later on as your party gets stronger, you will of course explore every 
single square in every single maze in the game).  You will by now have 
heard about Castle Xabran, Lloyd's Beacon, Castle Pinehurst, Queen 
Lamanda and many more.  So lets start heading north to find Corak's cave 
at C2-5,11.  You can go there through the woods if you have 2 pathfinders 
but try to find the path.  Enter the cave and get the spell Lloyd's Beacon.  
You should be able to finish off the northern half of the cave this time but 
unless you've got admit 8 pass found in the cavern below Sandsobar you 
cannot enter the southern part and its not to be bothered with this time 
anyway.
Back to the surface, go back to the main road and walk north to Castle 
Woodhaven.  Enter if you have a crusader and visit Lord Hoardall at 9,11.  
Accept one of his quests if you like but note that if you do, you must 
complete it to be offered other quests at Castle Woodhaven or Castle 
Hillstone.  So, I wouldn'd bother with any other but the Lord's quest, which 
you have plenty of time to solve.
Now leave the castle and find your way to Tundara.  (This first outdoor 
tour is very much like the guided tour around the towns; you are learning 
your way around).  Trail your way back to C1 and try visiting 1,1 to get 
another quest, which as most of the quests in this game, can be solved 
anytime you like.  Go back to Square Lake and take the trail that crosses 
the river below the lake.  Follow the river soutwards until you find a weird 
dude walking on the river.  Here you should be able to get the spell Walk 
on water by now.  Go back to the trail and head east until you see a sign 
pointing north to the Luxus Palace Royal (queen Lamanda).  Don't go there 
yet.  Instead backtrail to C2 and take the path that leads south at 14,4.  
Follow that path to the woods and turn east.  Walk on to D3 and turn at 
13,3 to the south.  At the end of this road is Castle Hillstone where you find 
Lord Slayer at 5,2.  If you accepted Lord Hoardall's quest you can do 
nothing here by now, else you can accept Lord Slayer's quest.  Go back and 
turn east at 13,10 (D4), which will take you to Sandsobar.  Now go back to 
the Square Lake and explore the east side of the lake.  You will find castle 
ruins and later you should be able to determine which castle this is and 
how to get there.  Now it is time to find the way to Vulcania (maybe you 
will have some nice fights on the way, I will wait meanwhile...)
Ahh, back already?  Now we will take the road that leads to castle 
Pinehurst on the west side of the lake (come on, you know which lake).  
Don't bother with the circus until between days 140 and 170 (see part 11 
of this walkthrough).  At 14,7 at A2 you will find some wagon tracks; this is 
the way to Sarakin's Mine, a good place to get rejuvenated - but only when 
you are a lot stronger than now.  Go on to Castle Pinehurst and find Lord 
Peabody at 4,3.  Accept his quest (and this is a vital one for the solution of 
the game).
 
7.  Getting stronger
If you think I forgot about the road to Atlantium you're wrong!  I expect 
you to find your way to the island as you grow stronger.  Now it is time for 
you to raise your characters.  This you do by exploring the rest of the town 
caverns, the outside world and the three castles already located.  
Remember to take every hint and every location of anything you learn 
about.  Battle in the Arena, The Monster Bowl and the Colosseum if you like 
using the appropriate tickets.  As I told in the beginning, take special notice 
to hints on keys, queen Lamanda and the triple crown battles.  If you 
stump upon new hirelings or informations about those, you should free 
them and change hirelings as they will almost certainly be stronger (and 
more expensive) than Nordonna's sons.  Don't miss the location of Mount 
Farwiew at D2-7,0.  Also, on your way you will find some encoded 
messages in three colors; green, yellow and red, and the three clues to 
these messages, the green, yellow and red interleaves, are located at three 
different places.  If you have problems decoding these messages, the 
solution is written at the end of this walkthrough.
 
8.  Lord Peabody's quest
Worried about day 93?  Well, there are two ways to to get Natures Gate.  To 
have your own clerics learn it go to C3-1,9.  Note the old druid's food and 
let your cleric order it at the proper tavern.  Go back - and you've got it!  
The other way is to free the two captives at Native's Cove at B4.  Explore 
the area and don't give up until you succeed.  These two hirelings will 
probably be your best so far (after I got much stronger and freed the 
prisoners at Sarakin's Mine, I used them mostly throughout the end of the 
game).  Go back to Lord Peabody and get your reward, the license to use 
the time machine!
 
9.  Queen Lamanda
Now you should be ready for Queen Lamanda.  Go to Luxus Palace Royal 
defeating Mandagaul on your way and visit the queen at 7,13.  By now, you 
should know that you have to win the triple green key battle, the triple 
yellow, the triple red and the triple black.  Start by buying three green 
tickets at Middlegate and the green key at Lock and Key Ltd.  Win the 
three battles at the Arena, the Monster bowl and the Colosseum.  Then go 
to castle Woodhaven and free the bishop of green battle from his 
imprisonment with the green key and collect your reward.  Repeat this 
process for the other color battles.  The bishop of yellow is in Castle 
Pinehurst, the bishop of red is in Castle Hillstone and the bishop of black is 
in Luxus Palace Royale.  Now go back to the queen to find out that she still 
demands some more deeds to be done before you can get an audience.  
Time for more strenghtening.
 
10.  Castle Xabran
This is a good time for exploring this castle from the last century.  You 
know now where it is and how to get there, don't you?  In this castle, you 
should be able to find complete information about the locations of all spells 
and all hirelings.  Here are also 4 vital objects for completing the game, the 
four elemental discs.  Also, in each of the other four castles, is a vital
object for your main quest.
 
11.  The circus.
By the way this is not a necessary task.  Go to the circus, then to D3-7,13 
with a cupie doll.  Follow the old man's advices and then return to the 
circus to raise the ability you like.
 
12.  The druid's cave and Murray's Resort Island.
To get most out of the island, you should buy at least one guided tour from 
the agency at Middlegate.  But go first to the Druid's cave to get a lot of 
information, much strenght and at least one spell.  Don't forget to finish off 
Horvath and only then go to Murray's island.  Explore the cave (if you have 
problems defeating the stone golems, then just skip them for now) to find 
the power oil and some information on your quest and then try to visit 
Murray.  To do this, you must head the signs on the way to his room.  He 
will offer you a quest, accept it and return after finishing it for your 
reward.
 
13.  The plus quest.
Now you should be ready for the long and somewhat tedious quest of the 
jurors on Mount Farwiew.  If you, for instance, start out with the knight's 
quest, you go to Middlegate Inn and get rid of all other characters but 
knights and robbers (remember, robbers can help in all quests).  Then go to 
all inns and collect all hirelings that are knights and robbers.  Equip them 
and take off to defeat the dread knight.  After that you go to the mountain 
to confirm your deed and then back to Middlegate to train your characters 
some 10 levels!  Repeat this process for all the characters you plan to use in 
the final quest.  If you are not using barbarians and ninjas, you don't have 
to finish their tasks.
After you have had all your favorite characters gain their plus, you gather 
them together again and visit queen Lamanda.  She will accept them as the 
stalwart band to rescue her father from the battle with the mega dragon, 
which happened last century.  Remember, to get her goodwill, all your 
characters visiting her must have won the triple battles and finished their 
plus quests.
 
14.  Some more training and money-making.
Now you are almost ready for the elemental planes but I assume you are 
getting low on money.  No problem anymore!  Your characters are so strong 
by now that they will have an easy riding in the dragon's dominion at D1, 
where a lot of money can be collected (I'm talking millions of gold each 
time you visit the cave).  Just don't bother with the ancient dragon until 
you have discovered the secrets of the desert at E2.  Underways, don't 
forget to visit the nomad's cave at E3 for a lot of information.  And the 
gemmaker's cave at E1 should also be visited at this time.
 
15.  The elemental planes, the orb and king Kalohn.
Now it is time to get the four elemental talons.  To do this you must have 
the four discs from castle Xabran.  I will not give you the excact locations of 
the talons but don't leave the elemental planes until you have found the 
red messages as well (3 of those at earth plane and 2 at the others).
After collecting the 4 talons, you go for the elemental orb.  It is located in 
Dawn's cave (D4 3,8) at 10,15.  On the way you must defeat the orb 
guardians and to get the orb, you must possess the fluxer, the todilor, the 
radicon and the capitor.  To escape from the cave with the orb, you must 
give it to a hireling and then dismiss that hireling.  He will return to the
inn you last checked into and wait for you there.
Now you visit your friend, lord Peabody, and use his time machine to get to 
era 8.  Go one step north and voops!  You are watching king Kalohn the 
vanguished preparing for the battle with the mega dragon.  The king will 
ask you for the talons and the orb.  Accept his request and you have 
changed history!  The dragon is defeated and the king thanks you and asks 
you to see him at Luxus Palace Royale.  Go there and get information on 
your final quest.
 
16.  The final quest.
The Square Lake Cavern is a very difficult one and you should by all means 
have finished off the dragon's dominion first to get get a BIG raise on your 
hit points (defeat the ancinent dragons, then explore the upper right half 
and then the lower right half of the cavern).  When you at last after a great 
effort have killed the evil threat, you'll have to solve a cryptogram in 15 
minutes.  This changes each time you get there but the solution is always 
the same:
 
WE, THE PEOPLE OF TERRA, IN ORDER TO FORM A
MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE,
INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY,
PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE...
 
The answer is always PREAMBLE as stated, so encode PREAMBLE according 
to the cryptogram and its solution ... and you have saved Cron!!!
 
Congratulations!!!
 
When you arrive at Middlegate, don't forget to train your characters a LOT
for the sequel.
 
P.S. If you find out how to get to squares 7,6 - 9,6 in dragon's dominion,

If personal statistics you'd like to enhance, with circus games you should 
take a chance. Win dumb prizes, but don't feel bad, you can offer these toys 
to an old man who can be had. His hut in the wilderness is dwarfed by a 
tree. For the toy, he gives you a tip for free. Drink from the Inner Limits 
pool. Though once it was acid, now it is cool. With thirst now thoroughly 
sated, go back to the Cicus and play games to raise those statistics which 
you truly hated.

To right ancient wrongs, the solution is very long. The Triple Crown must 
first be done, with Arena, Monster Bowl and Colosseum to be won. Next, the 
party must split individually so that each may fulfill their personal destiny. 
Request an audience with the Queen so the Chosen One can be seen.  Travel 
through time with Talons and Orb. Save the dead King from destruction and 
get the password. Then visit the lake geometrics to find passage to that 
which you must hurriedly fix. JVC

	HYBRID PRESENTS THE MANIAC MANSION 2 HINT FILE!
        -----------------------------------------------

	Ehrm guys, to be really honest with you I think
	that the only way to be sure about MM2 is to use
	the manual protection textfile we put out yester-
	day, coz all the cracks seems to fuck up somehow!

-Hoson 93.06.12
---------------------------------------------------------


        Here's the hints guys! All summarized up!

As Bernard when starting-
1)So where is the secret lab?
        Open the grandfather clock.

2)Where are the battery plans?
        On the bulletin board in the lab between the generator and the
        Sludge-o-Matic machine.
AS HOAGIE-
1)So how am I supposed to save the world?
        Find Red Edison, get the battery built, get the battery charged,
        plug in the Chron-o-John.

2)How do I find Red Edison?
        Enter the grandfather clock in the foyer and enter the secret
        passage.

3)Who's the guy in the field?
        That's Ben Franklin-knows a lot about electricity-check back with
        him after you get the battery built.

4)What about the mummy?
        That's Dead Cousin Ted-talking to his silent, bandage-wrapped bod
        often helps Hoagie organize his thoughts.

5)I can't get Red to build the battery.
        He needs oil, vinegar, and gold; you'll have to provide the 
        ingredients.

6)How can I get the gold?
        You could try to take the pen on the table, but they would catch
        you, You'll need to get rid of them, there is a smoke alarm on the
        mantle, they seem very concerned about fire.
        To start a fire, you'll need Jefferson's log.

7)Jefferson won't fork over the log.
        He sure does admire Washington!
        If he thought Washington was cold maybe?

8)What would make Washington look cold?
        Make his teeth shake so he thought he was cold.
        Replace his current false teeth with the chattering teeth
        found in the convention hall in Bernard's timeframe.

9)How do I get the chattering teeth?
        Open the floor grate by the fireplace, then chase the teeth into the 
        grate, and pick them up from there.

10)Washington won't take the teeth.
        You'll need a cigar to remove those teeth.  You have to find a way
        to get one from the novelty salesman in the convention hall in
        Bernard's time.

11)How do I get the cigar from the salesman?
        Sabotage the lighter so he can't use it! You need to switch the flag
        gun from Dwayne's room for the lighter gun in the convention hall.
        Dwayne's chair (on the door) is in the way; you need to get Dwayne
        to leave, so Bernard can grab the gun.

12)How can I get Dwayne to leave?
        He is very depressed-he could use some good news.  If only someone
        admired one of his ideas....Have Hoagie get the letter from the 
        mailbox and give it to Bernard to give to Dwayne.

13)O.K., I've built a fire, but I still can't get the pen.
        You need to block the chimney, but you need something that can be
        stuffed into the chimney to keep the smoke in.  Use Handcock's
        blanket-go up on the roof (through the attic) to do it.

14)Where can I find the oil?
        Check the kitchen for the oil.

15)How do I get vinegar?
        Start with the bottle of wine in Franklin's room.
        Wine turns into vinegar if not properly stored.
        Time is the key factor-give it to Jefferson for his time capsule.

16)How do I open the time capsule?
        Laverne has to open it in the future after the tentacles dig it up,
        now if only Laverne had some way to open a metal canister.  Have 
        Hoagie give Laverne the can opener.  Then she can use it in the
        Colonial Room to open the time capsule and give Hoagie the vinegar.

17)How do I get Laverne out of the tree and upstairs?
        See Laverne's section in this Hint Book.

18)O.K., I've given the battery ingredients to Red, and i've got the battery,
but it still won't work.
        Try looking at the battery. You need to get it electriclly charged-
        try Franklin's kite.

19)Ben says it's too sunny for his experiment.  How can I make it rain?
        Wash the carriage with brush, soap and water.

20)I've found the water.  Where's the brush and soap?
        The brush is in the cabinet in the washroom where you found the 
        bucket.  The soap is on the maid's cart.

21)I still haven't found where the soap is.
        You'll need to do something in Washingtons room to make it messy..
        Use the bed, pull the sash, then run out in the hall and pick up the 
        soap off the cart.

22)How can I get Ben to fly the kite again?
        He still needs waterproof kite material.  The lab coat in Red's 
        workshop is waterproof.  Give him the lab coat from the lab 
        downstairs, then use the battery with the kite when Ben gives it to
        you.  Push the kilte when Ben says "Now". Then pick up the battery
        and plug in the Chron-o-John.

23)How can I get the lab coat?
        Red might give it to you if you were trusted.. Hire on his assistant
        by giving him the Help Wanted sign.

AS BERNARD-

1)When can I get a diamond for the time machine?
        You need money. If Dr.Fred were to sign the contract in the safe in 
        his office...

2)How do I get Dr.Fred to open the safe?
        Talk to Edna about the way to his heart..
        Put him to sleep by using the Decaf coffee from the kitchen in his
        mug.

3)I still can't get the safe combination.
        He keeps his combination in his head.  You need someplace to observe
        Fred carefully.  Watch Dr.Fred on TV in Edna's room

4)How do I get past this Edna person?
        Don't you wish you could push her out of the way? The problem is 
        that sword on the statue.  If only the statue were right-handed...

5)How can I get rid of the statue?
        Have Hoagie get the left-handed hammer from Red's workshop, and
        switch it for the right-handed one in Jed & Ned's room, then push
        Edna.

6)Dr.Fred spins the dial too fast.  How can I slow him down?
        Maybe you could slow the TV image down... Get the video tape from
        Green Tentacle's room.

7)Fred is still to fast for me.
        Try instant replay.. Use the tape with the VCR, then press the red
        record button.  Rewind the tape, then change the right hand switch to 
        EP. Now play the tape again.  Bernard now knows the combonation and
        can open the safe.

8)How do I get the contract signed? Dr.Fred has disappeared.
        He hasn't disappeared; he's up in the attic tied to a bed.

9)The IRS won't let me see Dr.Fred.
        Sneak up the chimney.

10)Dr.Fred can't sign the contract. He's all tied up.
        Pick up the rope.

11)How do I remove red tape?
        If only someone would take his place.. Maybe you could get another
        family member to help here..

12)How do I move Ted?
        Use the rope with the pulley. Tie the rope to Ted.  Pull the rope 
        while standing on the roof.

13)The IRS dosen't seem to be fooled.
        Color him red.. Get the red paint from the attic.

14)How do I get Fred out of the attic?
        Try the same way you got Ted in. Tie the rope to Fred, then go out on
        the roof and pull it.

15)Now that i've freed Fred, how do I wake him up?
        You need the regular coffee from the kitchen.

16)Fred dosen't seem thirsty.
        Use the funnel from the cabinet in the washroom with Dr. Fred, then
        use coffee with the funnel.

17)Fred won't sign the contract.
        Tell him you'll stop the tentacles by yourself.

18)Wait a minute; this contract's outdated.
        Just like he should have shut off the sludge machine earlier.  This
        isin't a problem when you've got a time machine. Let Hoagie mail it.

19)Where can I get a stamp?
        Weird Ed's got some and as long as their useful he'll keep them.  
        Get the disappearing ink from Dwayne's room and use it with the stamp
        album.

20)O.K., Dr. Fred has money, but he won't order the diamond.
        Get Dr.Freds bankbook from the office, then make sure to watch TV
        before you call the Shopping Network.
AS LAVERNE-

1)How do I get Laverne out of the tree?
        That tree has got to go.

2)What could hurt a kumquat tree?
        Get Hoagie to talk to George Washington about chopping down the tree!

3)This isin't the right kind of tree for George.
        Paint the tree red with the paint from the attic, then challenge
        George's tree-chopping ability while he's in the convention hall.
        (Dialouge path 1,1,2,2, if you haven't alked to him before, otherwise
        2,2)

4)Now Laveren is imprisoned.  How can I get her out?
        Have Laverne talk to the guard and say she's sick or ask to go to the
        bathroom.

5)O.K., how can I get Laverne out of jail FOR GOOD?
        You need to make a tentacle costume with the tentacle chart from the
        tentacle doctor's office, those would make a good patern for a 
        costume.

6)Who would make a disquise?
        Try leaving the tentacle pattern with Betsy ROss.

7)Laverne can't get to the Chron-o-John.
        You'll have to get Laverne captured again, then tell the guard you 
        have to go to the bathroom and head for the yard.

8)How can I get to the roof?
        Use the fireplace!

9)How can I reach the disquise?
        Get the crank from Bernard and use it with the crank box, then turn
        the crank.

10)How can I get the guard to let me open the clock?
        Get rid of him. What is the thing he loves to do? Chase down and
        catch escaping humans. So get some to escape.

11)None of the humans in the front hall want to go anywhere.
        Get rid of the Kennel Guard. If you won the contest, you could use
        the dinner certificate.

12)How do I win the contest? I don't have a human.
        Ted, the mummy, sort of looks like a human.

13)Ted won't leave the room.
        Use the skates. Then push.

14)When does the contest start?
        You need to register Ted first.  Get a tag from the blue tentacle
        by the fireplace in the regisration room.

15)When does the judging start?
        Talk to the judges to get them to attend to business.

16)How can Laverne win?
        Get rid of Harold.

17)Harold won't leave.
        He might if he were sick or looked sick.  What about the fake barf
        in Bernard's time? You need to get it off the ceiling. Turn on the 
        stereo and push over the speaker in the middle of the tentacles'
        room, then get the barf and have Laverne use it with Ted.

18)I got rid of Harold, but I still don't think Laverne will win.
        Ted lacks a certain lifelike quality.  He needs a better laugh,
        a better smile, and better hair.

19)How can I get a better laugh?
        Get Oozo's laugh box from the clown in the convention hall in 
        Bernard's time.

20)That clown drives me crazy.
        Use the scapel to do him in.

21)How can Ted get a better smile?
        Who has nice teeth? The talking horse in Hoagie's time has a really
        good smile.

22)Smiles aren't easy to steal.
        They are dentures. Put the horse to sleep.

23)What could relax a horse?
        Bernard's textbook could put anyone to sleep.

24)How can I cure Ted's scalp problem?
        Have you flushed the spaghetti?

25)Ted's "hair" just isin't good enough.
        Use the fork from the kitchen in Bernard's time with the spaghetti
        on Ted's head...

26)Even with the kennel guard gone, those darn humans still won't leave.
        You'll have to scare them.

27)What could possibly scare a human?
        A wild animal? a SKUNK?

28)Where could I find one of those human-scaring critters?
        The black cat outside? Paint the fence white so when he rubs his back
        he will get a white stripe.

29)How could I improve the appearence of the fence?
        There is no white paint in the whole game.  So use the Booboo-b-gone
        from Fred's office on the fence.

30)I still can't pick up the cat.
        Cat food could be a good thing to use to lure him down.  Use the toy
        mouse from the attic in the past.

31)That cat in the past is very selfish.
        What if there was something to distract him like a mouse? Something
        like a squeaky mattress?

32)The cat's too fast for Hoagy.
        Use the squeaky mattress with the other bed.

33)I made it to the basement, but there's no way to use the generator.
        You'll need a hamster from Ed's room in Bernard's time to power it.

34)Ed threw me out of his room, and I can't get back in.
        Give Ed the stamp album.

35)The only hamster is in the present, and I can't flush it.
        How can I preserve the hamster? Put him on ice-Put the hamster in 
        the ice machine.

36)What good is a cold critter?
        Thaw the hamster out in the microwave.

37)A chilly and wet hamster isin't very useful either.
        Maybe a sweater would warm it up.  The sweater's stuck under the guy 
        in the bedroon in Bernard's time.

38)How do I wake up the guy in pajamas?
        The Fickle Finger machine might move him-if you had enough dimes.

39)How do I get the dime out of the gum?
        Use the crowbar.

40)The guy in the ski mask won't give me the crowbar.
        He needs some other way to get in the car.  Give him the keys you
        can get by closing the door inside the honeymoon suite.

41)The sweater won't flush.
        2 problems - it's too big and it's too wet.  A dryer might solve both
        but it needs quarters.

42)Where can I get quarters?
        Use the crowbar with the candy machine.

43)Bernard can't get the sweater out of the dryer.
        Laverne can get it out...

44)I forgot why I needed the sweater.
        To warm the hamster so it can run the generator.

45)I've lost my hamster.
        He's in the mousehole.  What you need is a vaccum-cleaner.

46)Where could I find a vaccum cleaner?
        Have Hoagie use the vaccum cleaner flier from the lobby with the
        suggestion box.

47)Help! The hamster's stuck in the vaccum cleaner.
        Open the hatch and get it out!

48)How do I disable the booby trap?
        You already have - it's a one-hit wonder.

49)The generator's running, but I can't connect it to the Chron-o-John.
        Use the extension cord from the seventies exhibit through the 
        basement window to connect the Chron-o-John to the generator.

AS HOAGIE, LAVERNE, AND BERNARD TOGETHER

1)I'm too small to do anything and somebody stole my inventory.
        Everything you need is in the mansion, and being small wears off.

2)How can I get to the switch? There's 10 tentacles guarding it.
        Get the bowling ball from green Tentacle's room.

3)Old Purple Tentacle zaps me before I can do anything.
        Maybe there's a secret passageway you haven't noticed yet all through
        the game.  Get Dwayne's door open when large, get Old Purple to zap
        you, run through the mousehold when small, wait there until you grow, 
        and pick up the bowling ball when large.

4)Now Old Purple Tentacle won't let me throw the switch.
        If only you could shoot HIM with the ray gun.  There IS a mirrow in
        the room.  Talk to Old Pur into shooting Dr.Fred (Dialouge path
        1,4,1,3)

                Was this a bitch to type? YES! Enjoy it!

[10/07/90]          Secret Of Monkey Island:Part 1
Hi all:
 This is a general start for Secret Of Monkey Island.

The 1st thing you do is go into the SCUMM bar, talk to all the pirates.
Then go into next room and talk to the 3 important Pirates.  After that
wait for the cook to exit the kitchen, and enter that, take the slab of
meat, and dip it in the boiling Stuff.  G o outside step on far right
corner and knock the bird in the air, take the Fish.  Go back inside,
dip the fish in the boiling stuff Pick up the pot under the counter and
exit.  Next go visit the Voodoo guy and he says some crap, but take the
single rubber c hicken.  Next go outside to the pirates and talk them
into giving you a map and some money.  Next go into the jail talk to the
guy and he will want breath mints go to the store buy them, and give it
to the guy, he will ask you for a trade....  You can also g o into the
cliffs by going directly left up from the 1st screen you start on, if
you are in the path you can take a yellow petal from a flower bush...  I
have found an Island house with no way across other to use the chicken
pulley..  Another thing, i have found the Troll, he wants something, you
give him the stewed fish, and he lets you pass..  You then can go to a
house and you will find the guy who will train you.  Ok now go to the
circus, and use the pot as a helmet.  They will give you money, you then
go to the store and buy a shovel, and a sword.  Leave town, and go to
the trainer's house, he'll teach you about sword play, then leave.  Go
out and see all the walking pirates, and learn their insults. go into
the fork again, and wander around, when you see a small sign, push it
with your shovel.  Then walk along the wood bridge, and find the sword
master.  Challenge and beat her..  Great You have completed 1/3 of being
a pirate..  Now continue to walk around and find an 'X' dig there and
get the second treasure. ..  Ok now make your way to the governors
mansion, and put the yellow petal in the meat and give to piranhas dogs.
They will go to sleep.  Go into he house, take the vase open the door,
and enter..  Just watch it is kind of cool..  Then when you exit, go bac
k to the jail, give the prisoner the gopher repellant.  He will give you
a cake, Open the cake and look at the file..  Go back to Governors
house, go through hole in wall, watch some more.  Congrats you have just
gotten the 3rd part of being a pirate..  Now g o back to the Chicken
Pulley Island, swing across, tell the chrome dome that the governor was
captured, let him think, and when you play with the animal, stroke it!
Now go to the Master Swordsmen, tell her about the governor, get her to
join you.  Now go t o Scumm bar, pick up another slab of meat, and all
the mugs you can find..  Fill 1 cup with grog, and exit, make your way
to the jail. when you are about to lose the mug o' grog, select the use
mug (with the liquid) and replace with new mug.. then do it ag ain when
it is near death..  Then when you get to the jail, use the grog on the
jail cell.  You have freed him, Now ask him to join you..  Ok now go to
Stan's (Boat Place) and ask to buy a boat, he will tell you you need
credit so go to the store in town ( h e will also give you a business
card, and a compass)..  Ask the guy for a note, and watch how he opens
the safe, when he puts note back ask him to go speak to sword master.
Then go up to safe use the push/pull thing on the handle to open safe,
get note c lose safe, and go back to stan.  When you go to stan ask him
for the boat in the far back.  You say $5000, he will say no, so u
leave, he calls you back, you then buy the boat for $5000!  Now go to
where you 1st start game, and you will meet stan, he will wa nt to buy
boat back, and it is kinda funny!  This is the end of part 1!

Oh BTW There is a part when the sheriff throws you in the water, you get
the idol, and climb out, you automatically get the sword.

                   The Secret of Monkey Island Solve
                                Part ][
-------------------------------------------------------------------
First I'd like to say before I get on with this solution that I'd
like to see more solutions to some of these new games coming out.
I enjoyed reading the solutions for Part 1 of Monkey Island but it
was too damn confusing for some people and there were about 10 or
so of them all under different file names which pissed me off cause
I don't need to waste the time downloading, eh?  So please anyone
who writes a solution to a game, keep it neat and clean and none of
this Word Perfect or Word for Windows format shit, ok?  Thanks...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, first thing you have to do is open the desk drawer and look
inside of it.  You'll notice a book which you take.  This is just
a diary of the previous owner of the ship which you can read it if
you want to but it's not necessary.  Then grab the feathered pen
and then the ink off the desk.  Go out onto the deck and you can
talk to the mutinous pirates if you want to but they aren't going
to help you any.  Go climb up the rope ladder and grab the Jolly
Roger.  Then go back to the deck and down the hatch behind your
mutinous crew.  Go to the door and down into the kitchen.  Next,
open the cupboard and grab a box of cereal.  Open it up and you
will find a toy surprise which turns out to be a small key when you
look at it.  Get the pot on the table and go back up the ladder.
Now go down the second hatch from the crew's living quarters.  Grab
the rope and open the kegs on the left and look in them to get some
gunpowder.  Open the bottom right chest and look in it to get the
fine wine you will need later.  Ok, now go back up to your room and
use the small key you found in the cereal on the cabinet.  Get the
small chest and open it then look in it.  You will find a recipe
and some cinnamon sticks.  You can look at the recipe but you don't
need it since I will include the correct ingredients here.  Go back
out to the deck and use the rope on the cannon.  Then put the
gunpowder you have in the cannon nozzle.  Go back down to the
leaking storeroom and get some more gunpowder then go back to the
kitchen.  You might want to save your game here...Just a
suggestion...Hahaha...Ok, now here is the list of objects you need
to use in the pot:

- CINAMON STICKS
- RUBBER CHICKEN
- BREATH MINTS
- JOLLY ROGER
- GUNPOWDER
- FINE WINE
- CEREAL
- INK

Pretty weird, eh?  Oh well...Now you'll pass out and when you
awake, go out to the deck and you'll see you're are Monkey Island.
Go down into the kitchen and use the bussiness cards you got from
Stan in the red hot fire.  Run back up to the deck and use the
flaming mass on the fuse and use the pot then you'll get blown onto
the island.  You might want to save your game before you do that
because it's frustrating when the fuse burns out before you get the
pot on and into the cannon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep an eye out for the solution to Part ]I[ since I'm in the
catacombs right now, which are a pain in the ass, but I should be
done with it soon.  It's weird...G.P. LeChuck doesn't really seem
like a bad guy on the island at all!  Anyways, you can email me on
a board that I call if you need any extra help on the game.

The Secret of Monkey Island Solve

Part III

Solved and Typed By The Blademan:


Haven't seen a solve for part 3 yet, guess its my turn to type it out. I think
this part was a bit harder that the prevous parts, but what do I know!  Try and
solve the game on your own first, use this as a last resort. It takes all the
fun and adventure out of the game to simply read these cheats and walk thru the
game. Now to business...

You've just been shot from the cannon and ended up on the beach.  Pick up the
banana. You can read the sign posted on the tree if you like, it has some hints.
Now head into the jungle, go northwest, the screens will scroll as you make your
way around the island.  Go to the beach to the leftmost part of the screen and
read the note. Head back into the jungle. Go to the fort. Take the rope, the
spyglass, push the cannon, take the cannon ball and some gunpowder. Head back
into the jungle.

Go to the right a few screens, find the dry river bed, there is a strung up
person with some rope. You can't get the rope yet. Read the note. Head back
into the jungle. Go to the northest to the river fork. Take the rock that's
holding a note down. Read the note, next look at the rock, it's a flint. Now
go up the footladder, you'll come to a rock on a see-saw (catapult). Use the
spyglass till it tells you your looking at the bananas, then push-pull the
"primitive art" till its directly inline with it. Now go up the ladder, use
the spyglass again and look around for fun. Now push the big rock that's near
the edge. If you aligned the catapult correctly, it will hit the tree and
knock the bananas off. If not, go down and realign it and then get another
rock from the pile and oush it off. Try not to sink the ship. Fo a laugh, while
ontop of the stone lookout, walk to the righ as far as you can and see what
happens. This is Lucasfilms dig at Sierra.

Climb down from the rocks, read any notes. Once down, go to the damn, stand in
front of it. Use the gunpowder on the damn, use the flint with the cannon ball.
Boom! Ride the water. The go tothe pond where the hung person was and get the
rope from him. Throughout the who game, Herman Toothrot will come up to you,
talk to him if you like to learn some hints. Head back into the jungle.

Go right one screen, go to the beach, find the bottle, read the note. Then
gp south two screens to the "crack" and find the strong branch. Tie a rope
to it, lower yourself, tie a rope to the stump and lower yourself again.
Get the oars. Head back into the jungle.

Go back to the beach. If you see the monkey you can feed him all the bananas
you have. Once on the beach, pick up the bananas that fell off the tree when
you hit it with the rock. Use the oars withthe rowboat. Go north three times,
go to the beach, the head back into the jungle.

Go to the village. It appears empty, go east twice tothe big monkey head.
Get the bananas in the bowl. Go east twice. The cannabals will stop you.
Talk to them, they'll throw you in jail. In jail, get the cute skull, move
the board and escape. Now go back to the beach, use the rowboat and go
to beach where you found the bananas. Head back into the jungle.

Find the monkey. Keep feeding him all the bananas you have till he looks
happy. (Click on LOOK AT MONKEY) He will then follow you around. Now
head in the jungle, go north twice, then east to the clearing, this is the
sacred monkey grounds. Go the the totem pole. Find the nose, pull it, it
opens a gate to the monkey head. It will close as soon as you release it.
The monkey will climb up and hold it down. Go in and get the whimpy idol.
Bring this back to the cannabals and offer it to them so they don't eat you.
They will be very grateful. Go into the hut and get the banana picker, then
give it to Herman Toothrot, he will give you a key. (its a giant Q-Tip)
Walk around, if the cannabals don't reappear, leave the village then come
right back. Talk them and and get the navigator's head from them. You'll
have to trade your leaflet or brochure for it. Head back into the jungle.

Go back to the sacred monkey grounds, go to the money's head. (if you can't
get back in type USE NAVIGATORS HEAD and the gate will open) Then position
yourself in the giant monkey's ear and use the monkey key and the mouth will
open. Go into the catacombs, use the navigators head and follow the direction
the eyes point. After awhile it will lead you to the ghost ship. Once there
TALK to the NAVIGATORS HEAD and tell him you want the necklace. Wear the
necklace, it makes you invisible, go onto the ship.

Go below using the hatch. look around. Go through the passage, then pick up
the chicken. (See the glowing crate!! Also, notice the locked hatch?) Now go
back to the sleeping ghost, tickle his feet with the feather a few times till
he drops the grog. Get the jug. Now go up on deck, go left to the door, open
it. Here is LeChuck. You want the key hanging on the wall, but can't get near
it. Use the magnetic compass to get the key (this is where I was stuck !@#$)
Go back below and now open the hatch, walk down it. To get by the rat, pour
grog into the dish. Go to the pot, get some grease. Go above deck.

Try opening the door to the righ (Tool shop and Brig) It squeaks and the ghost
keeps shutting it. Put some grease on the hinge. Open the door, get the tools
and go below deck and open the glowing crate and get the root. Go to the
canabals and they will make a special potion for you. Go back to the ship.
You'll meet up with the ghost, talk to him. Your crew will also show up.
You can kill the ghost if you want.

Now you're back on MeLee Island, you want to stop the marraige. Use the
seltzer to kill the two ghost you meet. Go to the church. Once inside, click on
STOP THE WEDDING!! Save the game here. You need to be fast at one point here,
but if you blow it, you can still win. After a confrontation with the govenor
and LeChuck, the monkeys run off with the govenors ghost killer potion. Now
LeChuck will attemp to beat you up. If you are fast enough, spray him will
selter. If you don't, you'll be knocked into orbit. (I suggest letting it
happen to see this happen, its quite funny) You'll land on Stan's Used Boat
lot, right on a soda machine. Quickly pick up the ROOT BEER bottle and use it
on LeChuck. If you blow it, don't worry, you'll be knocked in space again,
you'll land at the sword instructors house. Use the root beer as soon as you
can. Once you do, LeChuck will vanish for good, the govenor will be your
girlfriend, fireworks will go off and you can now go to bed!

Great game. If you bought it, you can send in a card for the 256 color VGA
upgrade. I hope someone does and posts it on the boards. Kinda sucks that they
didn't include it to begin with.

If there are any typos, though! What do you expect at 2am...The Blademan

                         MONKEY ISLAND USER MANUAL

READ THIS FIRST...IT'S IMPORTANT!

 Although you may have played other Lucasfilm games, there are a few
differences in The Secret of Monkey Island that you should be aware of.
  The interface you use to play the game now has an "auto-highlight"
feature that highlights an appropriate verb when the cursor touches and
interesting or useful object on the screen. For example, when the cursor
touches a door that can be opened, the verb OPEN is highlighted on the
screen. By pressing the right mouse button or equivalent key, you can
automatically perform the highlighted action-in this case, opening a door.
Don't worry, though, this won't give away solutions to any puzzles!
  Also, you do not need to double-click on objects (or ANYTHING) to use or
activate them. A single click of the controller button should be used
consistently through the game.

ABOUT THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND

 In the Secret of Monkey Island, you play the role of Guybrush Threepweed,
a young man who has just hit the shores of Melee Island (somewhere in the
Caribbean). Our naive hero's travels have lead him to Melee Island in a
quest to fulfill his life's ambition...to become a fierce, swashbuckling,
bloodthirsty PIRATE. Unbeknown to Guybrush, however, there have been some
strange happenings in the area surrounding Melee Island and on the more
mysterious Monkey Island. As he walks into this maelstrom of mystery,
Guybrush will soon be very aware that things are not what they appear to
be, that even bloodthirsty pirates can be scared, and that there's more to
being a pirate than swinging a sword and drinking grog!
  Here's where you come in..You direct the actions of Guybrush as he first
explores Melee Island and then ventures on to Monkey Island. On Melee
Island, Guybrush will have to prove himself worthy of becoming a pirate by
completing THE THREE TRIALS. Through the course of completing the trials,
you and Guybrush will learn much about pirate life and local folklore. But
don't be surprised if you find that some of the people that you meet seem
rather anachronistic!
  If this is your first computer adventure, be prepared for an
entertaining challenge. Be patient, even if it takes a while to figure out
some of the puzzles. If you get stuck, you might need to solve another
puzzle first or find and use an object. But hang in there and USE YOUR
IMAGINATION, and you will guide Guybrush to discover..the Secret of Monkey
Island!

(irrelevant sections about COPY PROTECTION skipped!!!)

PLAYING THE GAME

  After the opeing title sequence and introduction, Guybrush will meet the
Official Lookout for Melee Island. When they have finished talking,
Guybrush will walk down to the dock at one end of the town of Melee. You
may begin directing his actions as soon as he gets to the dock. The screen
is divided into the following sections:

  1) THE ANIMATION WINDOW is the largest part of the screen and where the
animated actions take place. It shows the "camera's-eye view" of the room
or location that the main character is in. Dialog spoken by the characters,
as well as game related messages, also appear here.
  2) THE SENTENCE LINE is directly below the Animation Window. You use this
line to construct sentences that tell Guybrush what to do. A sentence
consists of a VERB (action word) and one or two NOUNS (objects). An example
of a sentence you might construct on the Sentence Line is "Use shovel on
dirt." Connecting words like "on" or "with" will automatically be inserted
by the program.
  3) VERBS must be selected from the words in the columns below the
Sentence Line. To select a verb, position the cursor over the word and
press the LEFT mouse button or the ENTER key. Verbs are highlighted in a
bright color when an obvious use for them appears in the Animation Window.
For example, when Guybrush is near a door that can be opened, position the
pointer over the door will highlight the verb OPEN. Pressing the RIGHT
mouse button or the TAB key will use the highlighted verb with the object,
which in this case happens to be the door. But remember, although a verb is
highlighted, that one verb may not be the only way to use an object. Try
other verbs as well!
  4) THE INVENTORY is the area to the right of the Verbs. At the beginning
of the game the inventory is empty. When Guybrush picks up or is given an
object to use during game play, the object is added to the Inventory. There
is no limit to the number of objects that Guybrush can carry (after all,
he's young and strong!). When there are more than six objects in the
Inventory, arrows appear to the left of the list. Use them to move the list
up or down.
  NOUNS (OBJECTS) can be selected in two ways. You may select a noun by
placing the cursor over an object in the Animation Window. Many objects in
the environment, and all usable inthe game, have names. If an object has a
name, it will appear on the Sentence Line when you position the cursor over
it. If no name appears for an object on the screen, you can be sure that it
has no signifigance other than as part of the background. You may also
select nouns by clicking on them in the Inventory.
  TO MOVE GUYBRUSH AROUND, simply point the cursor where you want to go,
and click. Notice that WALK TO is the default verb in the Sentence
Line-this is because moving around is what Guybrush will be doing most
often.
  "CUT-SCENES" ARE SHORT, ANAIMATED SEQUENCES-like sequences from a
movie-which can provide clues and information about the characters. They're
also used to show special animated sequences, as when Guybrush gets himself
into a fight while "exploring" a mansion. When you are viewing a cut-scene,
you do not direct the action.

THINGS TO TRY IN THE TOWN OF MELEE

(stupid redundant instructions skipped)

  Look at the poster on the first house at the dock.
  Find the SCUMM BAR (off to the right) and go in.
  Talk to each of the pirates who pop up on the Sentence Line inside the
bar...they'll provide useful information.
  Talk to the Important-looking Pirates seated in the adjoining room.
They're full of good advice about how how to become a pirate.
  See if you can outwit the cook to get into the kitchen for a look around.
Once in the kitchen, step out onto the dock...you might be able to have
some fun with that bird!

TALKING TO CHARACTERS

  There are plenty of "colorful" characters inthe game with whom you can
converse. Each person Guybrush meets will have something to say, whether
friendly or unfriendly...helpful, or unhelpful! Often, you can talk with
someone at one point in the game, and then return to them later to get new
information. To talk with a character, position the pointer on them and
press the right mouse button or the TAB key to use the Talk to verb
automatically.
  In a conversation, you will have to select what Guybrush says from among
the possible phrases at the bottom of the screen. Just click on the phrase
you want him to say. Of course, what Guybrush says will affect how other
people respond. And, as conversation continues, you could be presented with
a new array of dialog choices. Don't worry-we'll never punish you for
selecting the wrong or "funny" dialog response. After all, you're playing
the game to have fun.

(more useless and redundant shit skipped)

OUR GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

  We believe that you buy games to be entertained, not to be whacked over
the head every time you make a mistake. So we don't bring the game to a
screeching halt when you poke your nose into a place you haven't visited
before. We make it clear, however, when you are in a dangerous situation.
  We think you'd prefer to solve the game's mysteries by exploring and
discovering, not by dying a thousand deaths. We also think you like to
spend your time involved in the STORY, not typing in synonyms until you
stumble upon the computer's word for a certain object.
  Unlike conventional computer adventures, you won't find yourself
accidentally stepping off a path, or dying because you've picked up a sharp
object. There are a few dangerous situations where Guybrush can die, but to
anticipate them takes a little common sense, not excessive paranoia. Save
the game when you think you may be entering a dangerous area, but don't
assume that every wrong step will result in death. Usually you'll get
another chance.

 A FEW HELPFUL HINTS

 Pick up everything you can. Odds are, at some point all those strange
things will serve some purpose.
  If you get stuck and can't figure out how to proceed, try looking through
all of the itmes you've found and about how each one might be used. Think
about places you've gone and the people you've met. Chances are there will
be a connection that'll put you back on track.
  There is more than one way to solve many of the puzzles.

  That concludes this doc file.....

MORDON'S QUEST - SOLUTION - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Take the blanket, s, w, n, take the newspaper, e, n, e, climb the drainpipe,
n, s, w, s, when Mordon will appear and tell you your quest. Say Yes 
(well, you don't have to), n, e, take transporter and torch, light the torch
and go n, n, n.
 You are now in THE JUNGLE AREA. Go e, drop blanket, e, take and transport 
tusks, take the bamboo, nw, nw, take the batteries, ne, se, e, 
take the thorns and make a blowpipe, n, nw, ne, use the blowpipe, take the
pygmy, drop the bamboo, sw, e, give pygmy to plant, e, e, say frog,
(because the outline of the map is is meant to look like a frog), w, w, w,
ne, n, e, s, e, e, n, e, s, se, sw, s, e, ne, se, sw, take the dagger,
sw, e, e, take and transport metallic device, w, w, ne, ne, nw, sw, w, n, 
ne, nw, n, w, sacrifice frog, take and transport piece of machine, sw, se,
go rubble, drop transporter, w, w, d, take and break iron pyrites,
take diamond and take pyrites, u, e, e, take transporter, transport diamond,
d, e, n, and the jungle area is complete.

 IN TIME MACHINE: Push or press plate to move to other zones, though these
are random and you have no control over which zone you will be taken to.
 Just keep trying until you get the one you want. There are two options
when exiting southwards as well: the large cave is the jungle area and the
ante room is the futuristic area.

 THE UNDERSEA AREA: N, n, nw, climb into boat, d, take aqualung, n, n, n, se,
u, se, d, n, e, fill aqualung, w, s, nw, take black pearl, nw, n, n, n, 
off lamp, n, n, on lamp, take and transport glowing metal object,
transport black pearl, e, take and transport doubloons, e, e, u, wait, wait,
e, n, n, give newspaper to spiderman in exchange for spray paint,
take remote control, s, s, w, d, w, w, w, off lamp, s, s, on lamp, s, s, s,
s, s, s, u, s, s, drop aqualung, s, and the undersea area is now complete.

 THE ADVENTURE DEVELOPMENT AREA: This is reached from the time machine by
pushing the button while carrying the remote control and the iron pyrites.
Give the pyrites to the jester, w, e, take piece of machine, e, s, u, 
transport piece.


 THE FUTURISTIC AREA: E, drop geiger counter, e, se, nw, sw, spray paint,
8875, s, take and transport device, n, nw, sw, s, s, s, take and transport
ingot, n, n, n, nw, w, w, n, e, insert battery, w, s, e, e, touch plate, s,
press 3, press 1, press 2, press 2, press 4, press 1, n, w, touch plate, 
s, s, s, touch plate, n, take and transport crystal orb, nw, nw, take cigar,
nw, nw, return to time machine and use the phone, dialling 1611919
(P=16, A=1 etc), then back to the droid and say perseverance, n, 
take and transport unit, s, se, se, se, s, touch plate, n, n, n, e, se, ne,
nw, ne, nw, w, w, s, se, se, take and transport Roman coins and Cretan coins,
nw, nw, n, n back to the machine. Push plate until you reach...

 THE ROMAN AREA: Make sure you still have the cigar with you. Go north until
you can take the sword and shield, then smoke the cigar, transport laurels,
s, s, s, w, w, n, ne, kill and skin minotaur, take and transport piece of
machine. THE END.

SOME BRIEF NOTES:
 Saying Yes to Mordon's request causes the cupboard in the annexe to open up.
 The blowpipe is made up of the bamboo, berries and thorns.
 In the cave beyond the waterfall in the jungle area, the south-west exit
isn't given in the location description. It's still there though.
 Also, in the location where you get the crystal orb, there's a north-west
exit that is not indicated.
 The octopus cannot see you if you turn your lamp off.
 The phone call tells you 'All that glitters is not gold.' a reference to
Fools Gold, or iron pyrites, and from this you deduce that this is what the
jester wants.
 When you spray the paint on the invisible barrier you see the deactivation
code, 8875.
 When the droid repeats the word 'PASS', you are meant to word out that this
is the clue to the password needed for the adamantium barrier. 'P' is the
16th letter of the alphabet, 'A' the first and 'S' the 19th, making 1611919.
 As the program only accepts the first four digits of any inputs, you need
only dial 1611 to learn of 'perseverance', which is certainly something you
need in order to get through this frequently illogical adventure. END

CHEAT MODE
~~~~~~~~~~
 When the game starts go east, east, north and then kill the man. When asked
if you wish to escape, press 'Y'. After he's had another swipe at you and
you're asked 'Which way?' use CAPS SHIFT + 8 to jump outside the quote marks
and then delete them. Now enter the line CHR$ USR 4867, which forces a jump
to ROM, then ENTER, then RUN, and the program runs but the break protection
disappears. If you then POKE 250 into 23323, 23324 and 23325, your abilities
are then increased accordingly, which should make you a pretty fearsome
opponent.

   DEJA VU, by Mindscape, Inc.,  The game is played almost entirely with
the mouse - just point and click or drag when necessary. Occasionally,
you'll need to type in an address so the taxi driver will know where to
take you. This is a good place to mention one little problem with the
commands: There is no SEARCH command. When you want to search, you must
use the OPEN command. This may seem a little strange considering some of
the things you will want to search.

   By the time you resort to this walkthru, I would hope that you already
know what the game is about. If you don't know, that's understandable
because you have amnesia. The game begins when you regain consciousness
in a not too clean men's room. You soon discover that you have been
injected with some drug and that you do indeed have amnesia. If you
haven't done so already, please explore and map as much as possible.
You'll need to visit several addresses which I will mention in the
walkthru. You will have to cope with a few annoying characters such as
the mugger. And you will need money to pay the taxi fares. To save time
and confusion, I'll first list the addresses, telling you where to find
them, then I'll tell you how I dealt with the annoying characters and
suggest ways to get money. With all of that out of the way, you probably
won't need to read the rest of the walkthru; but, I've tried to put it
in order by location. Please remember this walkthru is just one of the
ways in which the game may be solved.

ADDRESSES:

Address #1: 1212 West End St. (found in glove compartment)
Address #2: 520 S. Kedzie (found in Penthouse Apartment)
Address #3: 934 West Sherman (found in Office)
Address #4: 1060 South Peoria St. (found by memory flash when you look)
                                  (at the map after taking antidote)
Address #5: 626 Auburn Rd. (Mrs. Sternwood tells you)
Address #6: Same as Address #4

ANNOYING CHARACTERS: 

Mugger: Hit him! You can get by with this several times. 
Hooker: Hit her! Then search her purse. 
Begger: Give him money or ignore him. 
Big Bad Guy: Hope you don't meet him. He hangs out in the alley. You can fight 
  	     him and might even survive. 
Alligator: Avoid,avoid, avoid.

MONEY: 

You have a few quarters and a 20 dollar bill which isn't quite
enough. You can play the slot machines in the Casino. Sometimes you win;
sometimes you loose. You can take the Hooker's purse - there's money in it.

WASHROOM: 

You wake up in the washroom. Take coat, gun and holster.
Examine the contents of the coat. There's a wallet in it so examine its
contents also. You might want to look in the mirror and tidy up a bit
before you exit.

Notice the puddle in the hallway and take a look in the Ladies' Room.
You'll find a gawdy earring on the toilet.

BAR: 

Not much to do here. But, it's a good reference point. You can see
several exits and a big black Mercedes.

UPSTAIRS (ABOVE THE BAR): 

Look at the pictures in the hallway. Then enter the Office. Search the desk. 
Take envelope. You have just found Address #3. To enter the Private Office, 
use the key from the wallet. Search the body. Take the Mercedes' key. Open 
desk. Take pencil and key marked "Front." There's more than one way to 
explore the building; however, I chose to exit through the window using the 
fire escape to get to the Weird Room.
 
WEIRD ROOM: 

Examine everything. Ah ha! You must have been strapped in
the chair and injected with DIETHANOL TRIMENE -- or was it SODIUM
PENTATHOL? Take the syringe from the waste can. You can ride the
elevator or whatever to explore the rest of the building.

CASINO: 

Put a few coins in the slot machine. Maybe you'll get lucky!

SEWER: 

Explore this area carefully. Beware the alligator! Try to find
the whirlpool for you'll need to know about it. It's down, down, and
down (I forgot how many times).

MERCEDES: 

(Unlock it with key from corpse.) Look in glove compartment.
Take photo, car registration, and map. You have just found Address #1.

GUN SHOP: 

You can buy or trade; but it isn't worth the trouble. If you
play the game on Sunday, you can't get in.

FIRST ADDRESS: 

(1212 West End St.) Put plastic card in slot by elevator
door. Search the Penthouse. Take photograph. You've just found Address #2.

SECOND ADDRESS: 

(520 S. Kedzie) Shoot the door! Take paper (combination to safe), 
diary, and key.

THIRD ADDRESS:

(934 West Sherman) The key from 520 S. Kedzie unlocks
both the pharmacy and Ace's Office. In Dr. Brody's Pharmacy, shoot file
cabinet and read the files to learn antidote for DIETHANOL TRIMENE. I
believe it's BISODIUMITIS. Fill sringe and inject self. You might as
well take a vial of SODIUM PENTATHOL while you're here. Then go upstairs
to Ace's Office.

 Shoot the shadowy figure you see through the glass door. (You can drag
the thug from behind the desk if you want to.) Read Ace's files. Since
you've just run out of addresses and the antidote is beginning to work,
you should review the things you've found. Look at the map you found in
the glove compartment. This should cause a flash of memory giving you
Address #4.

FOURTH ADDRESS:

(1060 South Peoria St.) In Private Office, open safe
using combination found at 520 S. Kedzie. Take key (it might open the
Mercedes trunk).

MERCEDES TRUNK: 

The key from the safe unlocks it. Remove gag (drag with
mouse). Give Mrs. Sternwood a shot of SODIUM PENTATHOL. She will tell
you Address #5.

FIFTH ADDRESS: 

(626 Auburn Rd.) Open mailbox. Take letter (ransom note). Use the door 
knocker. Hit the butler. In Guest Room, open bedside table and take notepad. 
Rub notepad with pencil (this is the Timetable). In Master Bedroom, get 
briefcase and blackmail letter. (You may consume the chocolates.) 
In Kitchen, consume the bologna.

SIXTH ADDRESS: 

(1060 South Peoria St.) You're almost back where you
started. You should have all the evidence you need to solve the case and
become a hero; however, there's one small problem. You still have the
murder weapon and, no matter how much evidence you have, the police just
won't believe you. So, before you go to the police, get rid of that gun!

GUN: 

Remember the Whirlpool in the sewer? Seems like a good place to lose a gun.

POLICE: 

When you have enough evidence and do not have a gun, go to the
Police Station. The three "important" bits of evidence are: The diary
from Vicker's house, the blackmail letter and the timetable from
Sternwood's bedroom.

THAT'S ALL: 

That's it except for all the hullabaloo. You're a hero!
Hope I covered all the major points. Oops! Don't forget to turn on your
printer. You deserve a reward for this one!

Okay I'm a BIG BAD GUY (eh eh eh does this remember you something mentioned
above in this file ????), but when credit is due, well it's due.

To begin playing SHADOWGATE, as with UNINVITED and DEJU VU (all from
ICOM Simulations), you need to familiarize yourself with the commands.
In this game use OPEN to open doors, books,and scrolls. EXAMINE will
describe the details of an object, or it will read a scroll or book.
SPEAK is used only once. HIT is not used in this game, nor is CONSUME.
OPERATE is the most important command in the game! It is used for
anything that involves mechanical manipulation, such as secret panels
and there are many secret panels! 

 For example, when the game begins you see a door with a skull over it.
Click on Operate, and then click the skull, and finally click on the
skull again. The skull will move, revealing a key hidden behind it. 
 So...let's begin the adventure of SHADOWGATE!

 Before opening the door take the key from behind the skull. Now that
you're inside, take and light one of the unlit torches you see on the
wall. Take the other one. (As your torches burn out, they warn you by
flickering. Light another one immediately and discard the old one when
it burns out.) 

 You will see two doors. One to the right (in the pillar) and one up
center (a double-door). Unlock, open, and go through the center door.
Discard the key; you won't need it again. You will see a hallway and an
alcove with a book and two candles. Open the book. Another key is hidden
inside. Take it, and go back and use this key to unlock the pillar door.

 Open the pillar door and go in. It's a closet. Take the sword and
sling. Discard the key. (You ARE saving the game regularly, aren't you,
in case you make a mistake or these instructions are confusing?) 
 
 Go back to the room with the candles and book. Do NOT move the book or
the candles. A trapdoor will open under you and send you to your death!
Take the two torches (ESPECIALLY the one that looks like a flashlight!)
And examine the masonry in this hall. At the back you'll find a loose
stone. Operate it and it moves away revealing a hole in the wall! Go
through the hole and you'll be in a room with a ledge. There's a doorway
on top of the ledge. Ignore it. It's a red herring and can't be entered!

 A silver arrow points to the right. Operate the left torch (click
Operate then click the torch twice) and a door opens! You can't take
these torches. They're secured, but take the arrow. Go through the
secret door. You see two bridges. Take everything from your inventory
except your torch. You'll then be able to walk across the rope bridge
without it collapsing. 
 
 You'll see a statue of a snake. Leave it alone, but remember this room
and how you got there. Go back and cross the other bridge, but first
light the special torch (the one that looks like a flashlight). It burns
with a green flame! Now, when you meet the Waif you can operate the
green flame torch on the Waif and give it a banishing hotfoot! (If you
don't do it quickly enough the Waif will curse you! And I don't mean
with bad language either!) 
 
 Take the two torches, the cloak, and go through the doorway you see.
You'll be in a room with barred windows. There is something inside one
of the windows, but you'll never find out what. There is a rope on the
ground, and a sign: EPOR. Click on SPEAK. Click on the rope. Type in the
word EPOR. (Yes, it IS rope spelled backwards!) The rope should rise and
provide you egress through the ceiling, but don't go there yet. First
take the scroll from the shelf. Leave the bottles. If you examine the
room, you'll find another loose rock towards the back. Operate it, and
another hole appears. We'll come back and go through it later. We need
to gather a few things from some other rooms first. 
 
 You can either go back the way you came or go up the rope. Let's go up
the rope. Click on the top exit. You'll be in a mirrored room with an
exit down the rope and another exit. Take the other exit. You'll be in a
hall of coffins. Might as well open the bottom right sarcophagus -- the
one that's covered with fish scales. There's a mummy inside. Use your
torch to set fire to the mummy, and take the scepter. 

 The other coffins contain a Banshee which won't kill you, but will
deafen you for awhile; some green goo that dissolves your little body if
you walk through it; and a bag of (unneeded) gold coins. (One of the
bottles you left down in the rope room is a goo dissolver, if you're
curious.) 
 
 Exit this room towards the bottom, and you'll find yourself in a
hallway with three doors. The one to the right is where you want to go.
You will see a shark swimming in a lake and a skeleton in the lake. And
of course the skeleton holds in his outstretched bony hands...? Yes,
that's right, a skeleton key! We'll be back for it. How? Easy, we'll
walk on water. 
 
 But, first go through the door you see up left. You'll see a waterfall
and an entrance blocked by a rock slide and some stones. You need ONE of
the stones for your sling. Ignore the blocked exit (another red
herring). Examine the waterfall. Aren't there always caves behind
waterfalls? Yes, go into this little cave. Operate the obvious stone
protruding, and a little sack of gems pops out, remove the gems from the
pouch and put them in your inventory. (There should be three!) 
 
 Now go back to the hallway where we saw the three doors and go left
this time. (Center is back to the mirrored room) You should be in a room
with a trapdoor and a pedestal. Ignore the trapdoor. Another death exit.
But there is a little gem-shaped notch beside the door you see. Try out
your gems on this notch. One of them should fit and you'll hear a
mysterious sound and see an orb form on the pedestal! Take the orb and
go back to the lake. Operate the orb on the lake. It will freeze. Now
you can walk on water! (Don't forget to take your orb back. You'll find
it by operating your torch on the lake. A little spot will melt and the
orb will pop out!) Now you can take the skeleton key! 

 Now go back to the pedestal room. Take out some heavy items from your
inventory. You can pick them up later. (Like the sword and cloak.) Open
the door you see in the pedestal room and go through it. Lurking in a
cave in the background are two eyes belonging to a dragon. Take the
shield first. It will protect you while you take the other objects you
need. Take the war hammer and the spear, then get out of there! 
 
 In the pedestal room, you can discard the shield. You won't need it
again. Make sure you have your cloak. Go back to the mirrored room. (Go
out into the hallway and take the center door, remember? Then go through
the upper left coffin!) 
 
 Operate the war hammer on the center mirror. You will see a door.
Unlock it with the skeleton key. Discard the hammer and the skeleton
key. Put on the cloak. (Operate the cloak on yourself.) Go through the
door, and you'll be engulfed in flames. Operate the orb on the flames.
(Remember its chilling powers?) The flames will be gone and so will the
orb. Discard the cloak. 
 
 Go back to the pedestal room and pick up anything you left, then come
back to the mirrored room. (What are the other two mirrors for? One will
just crack. The other will break open and you'll be sucked out into
space! A horrible way to die!) Take the torches and the broom from the
mirrored room, and go out the center mirror. 

 So, you're back in the room with a bridge across a pool of hot oil! Go
through the exit at the top. You'll be on a bridge. Try to go through
the door up center and a Troll appears asking for a toll. Don't pay him.
Throw your spear at him. He'll go way temporarily.
 
 Go through the door and you'll be in a courtyard with a well and a
Cyclops who wants to kill you! Put the stone in your sling and operate
the sling on the Cyclops. And then operate your sword on him. Just like
David, eh? Yes, the Cyclops is now dead. 
 
 Operate the crank on the well and a bucket comes up. Open the bucket,
take the glove within, and put it on. (Discard the sword and the sling.
You don't need them anymore!) You're ready to go in the Castle! 

 SHADOWGATE
   Part 2

 When you enter the castle you see a hallway. Take the torch. On your
immediate right is the Library, on your left is the Trogg room (a red
herring; don't go there), straight ahead is the Banquet room, and the
second door on your left is to the Lab which leads to the Garden. 
 
 Go to the Library first. You can read all the books! There are about
fifteen titles each of which has a paragraph which you will find
entertaining. One of the books provides a clue: Books can be used to
cast spells as well as scrolls.
 
 There is a book on the desk. Take it. Open the desk and take the key
and scrolls. Take the spectacles. Operate them on yourself. Now you can
read the book and cast spells! (You have taken the torches in the hall,
haven't you?) Take the skull on the bookshelf and the map on the wall. 
 
 Notice the gem-shaped shape in the wall? Yes, use another of your gems.
The bookshelves slide opening revealing another room. Go in and open
your scrolls. Find the one that has the word "Terra" in it. Operate it
on the globe you find in this room. It opens up and you find another
key. Leave the bottle. It's only useful for curing the curse of the
Wraith and you haven't been cursed, have you? Take the bellows by the
fireplace. Leave the other objects. Leave the library and go to the
Banquet room. (The up center door in the main hall.) 
 
 Operate your torch on the rug (notice that lump in the rug). The rug
burns away and you find another key. Now that you have three keys,
unlock and open the three doors you find in this room. (Two upstairs,
one downstairs.) Discard the keys here. Also drop the broom, bellows,
map and skull. 

 Go back to the main hallway. It's time to go through the lab to the
garden. On the way through the lab, operate the ring in front of the
little cage door. Don't open the cage, just operate the ring. A rock
rises up and you find a bottle of Holy Water. Take it. Take the
horseshoe over the fireplace. Go to the Garden and take the flute. (You
did put on the glove didn't you?) You can now discard the glove. If you
didn't have the glove, you couldn't get the flute. The fountain is
acidic. 
 
 Operate the flute. A little tune should be heard and the tree should
open. There will be a gem-ring. Take it and discard the flute. 
 
 Go back to the banquet hall. Discard the horseshoe. Go up the stairs to
your right. Enter and find a sphinx and some weird drawings on the
stair. Get a pencil and mark down the drawings. They are clues to the
positions of levers you will operate later. (The bottom step shows the
first position of the levers. Going up the stairs shows the subsequent
positions the levers should be in.) 
 
 The Sphinx will not let you pass unless you answer his riddle. There
are six possible riddles. The object the Sphinx wants you to bring is
either the horseshoe, the skull, the broom, the bellows, the mirror, or
the map. Go out to the banquet room and get whatever object you think
the Sphinx is asking for. Go back and Operate the object on the Sphinx.

 You can now go up the stairs. You'll be in an observatory. Take the
shooting star. Operate the picture it was in. A secret panel will reveal
an iron rod. Take the rod. Go up the ladder. Operate the silver arrow on
the pretty girl. She turns into a dead werewolf. Take the Thorn and
leave the arrow. Go back downstairs to the banquet hall. Go in the door
up the stairs to your left. Open the bottle of holy water. Try to take
the platinum horn. A demon dog will appear. Banish him to hell with the
holy water. 
 
 Go up the ladder. You will see a Wyvern. Operate the shooting star on
the Wyvern. When the sparks clear, take the Bladed Sun. Go down, back to
the banquet room. 

 SHADOWGATE
   Part 3

 In the Banquet room, go through the bottom door. You'll see a door to
your right and a door to your left. Take the left door, go down the
stairs. Leave the pot of gold alone. Open the bag. Take the large coin,
and one of the small coins (with a skull on it). 
 
 On the stairs, notice the flagpole hole? Operate the steel rod on it.
It's a lightning rod! A flash of lightning and a hand comes out of the
floor and offers a wand. Take it. Examine it and discover the sign of
the serpent. 
 
 Now where have you seen a serpent? Yes, the rope bridge! Go back to the
rope bridge. Remove everything from your inventory, except for the wand
and a torch. Cross the bridge, operate the wand on the snake. Take the
staff. Cross back over the bridge and pick up your inventory. Now go
back to the rope room (cross the other bridge). Go through the hole in
the back. Place your remaining gem in the hole on the slab in the
center. The Mage will give you a scroll called Wind Shadow.
 
 Go back to the Troll bridge. The troll reappears. But you don't have a
spear! Operate the Wind Shadow scroll on yourself. You'll be invisible.
You can cross safely and go back to the banquet room, and through the
bottom door, but this time turn right! You'll see a skeleton sitting on
a Throne. But he's missing his scepter. You have it, so operate it on
the skeleton. He grasps it tightly.

 Operate the panel to the right of the throne. It slides up revealing
another gem-shaped hole. Put the gem-ring in it, and the Throne rises
revealing a secret passageway. Go down. Take the torches. Do NOT go
left! (A slab will fall and kill you.) Take the other exit. You'll see
some gargoyles. Leave them alone for now. Take the exit farthest to the
right. You'll see a statue in the center of a pool of lava, and an exit
on the other side of the lava. 
 
 You need a bridge! Open the book you got from the library. (You HAVE
put your spectacles back on, haven't you?) Operate the opened book on
the statue. A bridge will form. Cross the bridge. You'll be in a room
with some levers. Remember, you wrote down the positions you had to
change them too. Use those drawings now. Operate the levers one at a
time, so they are step by step in those positions. (Operate the third
one, then the second one, then the third one again) Machinery will
operate and you will get a silver orb. Operate the Thorn on the staff.
 
 Operate the staff on the silver orb. You now have the Staff of Life! Go
back to the gargoyles and blind them with the Illumunaris spell. Go
through their door, and you'll be in the well room. Operate the crank.
 
 The well will open. Operate the LARGE coin on the well. A wind will
come up. Go down the well. The wind will allow you to descend
gracefully. You will be on a riverside. Operate the drumstick on the
gong. The Ferryman comes asking for his fare. Operate the small coin on
him. He says come aboard. Click Go, and click on the RAFT! Not on the
Ferryman! He will ferry you to a room with a skull door. There will be
three odd shaped holes in a panel. Just the same shape as the Bladed
Sun! Put the Sun in the first panel on your left. Operate the Platinum
Horn. The horn blows and the skull door opens. 
 
 Go in and you will see the Wizard with a Giant Behemoth. Operate the
Staff of Life on The Wizard? No, the Behemoth! Angered and banished
below, he takes the Wizard with him and you have won the game!

   What a night to be out driving! How it happened doesn't matter; but,
boy, are you in a mess. The last thing you remember is that something
jumped out in front of you while you and your little brother were out
for an evening drive -- you swerved the car smack into a tree. The smell
of a ruptured gas tank signals your instinct to survive. You OPEN the
car door and go out with your first move. As soon as you click your
mouse to get out of the car you hear an explosion -- better get moving.
With the car gone, you have no choice but to go inside that
haunted-looking house that looks like it came straight out of a comic
book.

   Before you go inside the House, it would only be fitting to find out
where you are. A good place to check would be the mailbox. OPEN the
mailbox. Guess what? It looks like you're in luck because there's a
letter inside. EXAMINE the envelope. Oh, no! You're at the Crowley House
on 666 (sign of the Devil) Blackwell Road, Loch Ness, Scotland. Loch
Ness: doesn't that mean monsters? If only you could turn around -- well
it's too late. If you're in this much trouble, you might as well snoop
around some more. OPEN the envelope. EXAMINE the letter. The letter
contains a clue that the amulet might be good against the undead. DRAG
the amulet into your inventory. It might come in handy.
 
   Now OPEN the front door and go through it. What a creepy house. The
door has slammed shut behind you and it doesn't want to open up. What
kind of trouble are you in now? EXAMINE the various pictures and the
furniture. After your ordeal, why don't you sit down (OPERATE) and rest
your feet on either of the chairs. Ouch! One of the chairs hurt you!
(Remember this: You'll want revenge later.) OPEN both doors. First, go
inside the room to your east (all orientation in this game is northern).

   You're in the Library. Notice the book on the table. EXAMINE the book.
OPEN the book then EXAMINE the book again. There are some definitions
that you would be well advised to write down in your notebook. Go out of
the Library back into the Entrance Hall. Now go out the door to the
northwest to the Hall. There are five exits, including the one you just
passed through. Your best bet is to go upstairs first. Maybe that's
where you'll find your little brother.
   
   The Upstairs Hallway has six exits, including the stairway you just
came up. OPEN all the doors. Now to check out all of the rooms. First,
go through the lower right door into the Storage Closet. EXAMINE all the
items. Pretty mundane stuff, huh? Bet you've never seen a product at the
supermarket called "No Ghost." DRAG the bottle into your inventory.
"Spider Cider" looks interesting, too: DRAG that along into your
inventory, also. By this time, you'll get the first signal that
something is really wrong in this haunted house -- the evil is starting
to get to you in very tangible ways. Go back into the Upstairs Hallway.
Now go into the middle right door. Another stairwell! What's this? A
weapon! DRAG the axe into your inventory.

   If you venture upstairs to the Tower, well all I can say is don't open
the Prison and don't go inside no matter how tempting it looks. It might
be the last thing you ever do! Go back to the Upstairs Hallway. Go
through the door on the lower left side into the Master Bedroom. On the
nightstand is a candle and a book. OPEN the book. DRAG the candle to
your inventory. EXAMINE the book. Well now you know the name of the bad
guy -- Dracon, huh? "A key is hidden someplace beyond his stare, a chair
knows where."

   Go out of the room back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go down the stairs
(south exit). Go through the open door (upper right) back into the
Entrance Hall. Remember the chair that hurt you before? Now is the time
for revenge! OPERATE the axe on the chair. In the rip is a golden
skeleton key. DRAG the key into your inventory. Take the axe and leave
it in the Entrance Hall -- it's too large to carry for now. Now go
straight back upstairs.
 
   From the Upstairs Hallway go into the first room on the left. OPERATE
the key on the large chest behind the bed. Now that the chest is
unlocked, OPEN the chest. Take everything from the chest and put it in
your inventory. OPEN and EXAMINE both scrolls. They contain clues that
will be very important to finishing the game. OPEN the door in the upper
left corner. Though everything in the room looks interesting, there is
really nothing inside here that is worthwhile. Go back into the Master
Bedroom. EXAMINE the pictures on the wall. They contain some clues to
the Master's relationships with others.
 
   Go back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go through the door in the upper
left corner into the Bedroom. EXAMINE, then OPEN and, once again,
EXAMINE the book on the nightstand. Reading the egomaniacal rantings of
Dracon gives you quite a clue into just what you are up against. OPEN
the nightstand. Aha, another scroll! OPEN and EXAMINE the scroll. The
scroll contains some important magic spells that use words you should be
familiar with from the book in the library. Write these spells down on
your notepad; you will be needing them soon.

   OPEN the door in the upper right corner and go into the Bathroom. OPEN
the hamper. A blood stained towel -- yech! Could the blood belong to
someone near and dear, like your little brother? You had better find out
soon. Go out of the Bathroom through the Bedroom, back into the Upstairs
Hallway. There is one last room you haven't explored. Go into the room
in the upper right corner. OPEN the black dresser and DRAG the star into
your inventory. Go out of the Bedroom, through the Upstairs Hallway, and
back downstairs to the Hall.
 
   Remember that bottle of "No Ghost"? You had better OPEN it just in case
you need it in a hurry. Now OPEN the lower right door. What's this? Out
of nowhere a woman dressed like Scarlet O'Hara has appeared in the Hall!
Anyone dressed in clothes from a century ago must be a ghost. OPERATE
the bottle of "No Ghost" on Scarlet and see what happens. Well, that
takes care of that as another ghost bites the dust.

   OPEN all the doors in the Hall. First, go through the lower right door
that you first opened before "Scarlet O'Ghost" pranced in. That takes
you into the Parlor. OPEN the outside door and go to the Veranda.
There's a quick spider going by too fast for you to stop him. OPERATE
the "Spider Cider" on the railing. Go back in the Parlor. On second
thought, go back outside on the Veranda to see if the spider might come
around again. Here it comes, slowing down in its tracks due to the
numbing effects of the "Spider Cider." Pretty good stuff! DRAG the
spider into your inventory. You never know when a spider might come in
handy for stirring up a brew or something. Go back through the Parlor
into the Hall again.
 
   Remove the "Spider Cider" and the "No Ghost" from your inventory and
leave them in the Hall. Go through the lower left door into the Rec
Room. OPERATE the gramophone. Pretty neat, huh? Too bad you broke it. It
must be quite a valuable antique on today's market. But, then again, a
lot of the creepy things you see in this house might fetch a high price
at a graveyard auction.

   EXAMINE the cabinet at the back of the room. OPERATE the key on the
cabinet. OPEN the unlocked cabinet and SPEAK to the doll. Say "SPECAN
HEAFOD ABRAXAS" (like the scroll in Dracon's room said). The doll tells
you to speak to her brother. OPEN both remaining doors in the Rec Room.
Go through the right side door into the Dining Room.
 
   DRAG the flowers from the table into your inventory. EXAMINE all the
pictures in the room. Be aware that some strange things will float out
of the pictures as if they have a life of their own. OPEN all the doors
in the Dining Room. Go through the upper left door to the Kitchen first.
 
   OPEN both the left and right doors. Go through the room on your left to
the Bedroom. OPERATE the lamp. Something strange happens. (Actually, in
this game, everything is strange! So maybe what's strange for the real
world is normal here at 666 Blackwell Road.) Too bad that "No Ghost" was
used up. Neither the amulet nor the star has any effect on the ghost.
Maybe the ghost is frightened by small living animals the same way the
mouse is legend for scaring elephants?

   OPERATE the spider on the ghost and it vanishes! EXAMINE, OPEN, then,
again, EXAMINE the diary that was hidden in the wall behind the picture.
It contains a clue for whatever is inside the box that was locked in the
large chest upstairs in the Master Bedroom.
 
   Fire and ice -- where to find either would be helpful right this
moment. Go out of the Bedroom through the Kitchen to the Pantry (the
room off the Kitchen's right). DRAG the box of matches from the second
shelf from the top. OPEN the matchbox. OPERATE one of the matches on the
matchbox itself. OPERATE the newly lit match on the candle you took
earlier from the Master Bedroom. Great! Now that should shed some light
on the situation. Everything in the Kitchen, the Pantry, and the
downstairs Bedroom is interesting but will not help you to complete the
game. In fact the more mouse clicks that you waste in these rooms, the
more time you lose. And those mouse clicks become valuable with time.

   Go out of the Pantry through the Kitchen back into the Dining Room. Go
through the door in the top center of the Exits Box to the Study.
EXAMINE the locked door. Besides being locked, there is something
strange about that passageway. Hmm! Maybe the key that the creature has,
huh? You'll have to be patient with that one. You aren't fast enough to
make a difference in his life.
 
   OPEN the desk. Inside the desk are some files about different elements.
DRAG the file on Gold, Silver, and Mercury into your inventory. Those
elements were all mentioned as being able to make a key when put
together. You will have to EXAMINE most or all the files to find all
three cards.
 
   Go out the open door to the Dining Room. Go through the Hall back into
the Entrance Hall. OPERATE the LIT CANDLE (that you have been carrying
in your inventory) on the FIREPLACE. Besides taking a chill out of the
air, you now have a big fire. OPERATE the sealed box that you took from
the cabinet upstairs on the burning fire. The box will dissolve, leaving
a pentagram. DRAG the pentagram to your inventory. Without it you cannot
finish the game.
 
   Go back through the Hall and the Rec Room to the Trophy Room. DRAG the
cage into your inventory. While there are several items that look
helpful or interesting, they are red herrings.
 
   AT THIS POINT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR GAME because when you
OPEN the door in the upper right corner, you never know what kind of
hell is going to break loose!


 OPEN the door in the upper right corner, and go outside to the
Backyard. In the Backyard are three paths to three different buildings.
Obviously, you will have to visit each building. Your brother just might
be inside one of them waiting to be saved! First, go to the Building in
the center. OPEN the door at the entrance and go inside the Greenhouse.
EXAMINE ALL of the plant pots in the room. One of them is different from
the others. OPERATE the watering can on the DIRT-FILLED RED-CLAY POT.
DRAG the RED-CLAY POT into your inventory. There isn't much else of
interest in this building. Go out of the Greenhouse, and return to the
Backyard.

   Go to the Domed Building. No matter how you try to OPEN the door at the
Magisterium, you fail. EXAMINE the niche over the Magisterium door.
Something that should be there, isn't. Pay attention -- be on the
lookout for an object shaped like the emblem on Superman's chest to fill
that niche. Maybe a jewel? Maybe the same jewel mentioned on the scroll?
 Since there is nothing that will be accomplished by just standing
around a building that you can't get inside, you might as well try the
last building. Go back to the Backyard. From the Backyard, go to the
building on the right.

   At the Chapel entrance are two very rabid-looking dogs. They don't look
very nice. In fact, if you aren't careful, they might bite your head
off! SPEAK to one of the dogs and be very careful about your spelling.
Say "INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS." After the thunder and lightning
stop, the dogs will go away.
 
   Thank God! In fact, you might just get a chance to do so once you're
inside the Chapel! OPEN the Chapel door and go inside. There is a bust
inside the Chapel. SPEAK to the bust. Say "SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS." This
must be the brother to the doll in the rec room cabinet. The statue head
will open the door in the upper left corner for you.

   OPERATE the lit candle on the large standing candleholder in the
Chapel. You will need the candleholder to get through the next stage of
the game, so try to DRAG it into your inventory. If it doesn't fit (and,
if you've been following this walkthru to the letter, it shouldn't),
REMOVE the potted plant. You should note that it has begun to sprout.
Isn't nature wonderful? Now DRAG the candleholder to your inventory.
   
   Go out through the open upper left door to the Church Grounds. A ghost
will come by. If you have the candleholder he will leave you alone. If
you don't -- well don't say you weren't warned! Ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

   NOW IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DO A GAME SAVE!

   Go to the building in the center of the Church Grounds. Oh, no! A maze!
Now is the time to make a map. Go through the maze with the following
directions. All of them have a northward facing orientation.
 
   North, west twice, and north twice. At this point you'll find the grave
of Doug Dinsdale.
 
   East twice, north four times, and east four times.
 
   If you see a lone Zombie (and of course you will), OPERATE the gawdy
chain necklace that you originally found in the mailbox at the beginning
of the game ON THE LONE ZOMBIE. If you run into a group of
zombies...well, nothing works against them, so run away.
 
   Continue east twice and south twice. Here you will find a CROSS marking
a grave.
 
   OPERATE the bouquet of flowers on the CROSS as a sign of your respect
for the dead (which you hope you aren't among soon). The cross will
move, revealing another Secret Passage. Go through the Secret Passage
(west). You are in a room with three cages. OPERATE the KEY that you are
(hopefully) carrying in your inventory on the LOCK to the cages. OPERATE
the CAGE on the EAGLE to capture the bird. The snake will eat the cat
and slither away.

   Go south twice. You will meet a strange, ugly bouncing creature. Notice
as he bounces that there's an object just underneath him. OPEN the cage
and release the bird. The bird will fly away and the creature will
follow it. DRAG the gem into your inventory. It looks like it will fit
the niche in the Magisterium door!
   
   Go north twice, east, north twice, west four times, south twice, west
twice, south twice and east twice. Here you should find Doug Dinsdale
again.

   South twice, east twice and south twice. You should now be back outside
on the Church Grounds.
 
   It would be a good idea to save your game here. You wouldn't want to go
through that maze again. Would you?

   Yipes! It seems you are still being watched by that flying eyeball --
the proverbial eye in the sky! Go south into the relative safety of the
Chapel.
 
   Notice how the plant has thrived while you were away in the maze? Hey!
How long were in that maze anyway? Return the candleholder to the
Chapel. DRAG the potted plant to your inventory. DRAG the CROSS from
above the altar into your inventory. The altar will move, revealing a
new entrance. You will be warned about a giant spider. This time it pays
to heed the warning. DO NOT GO DOWN INTO THE SPIDER PIT! Exit the Chapel
and go back to the Backyard.
   
   From the Backyard, go to the Domed Building on the left. OPERATE the
gem on the niche above the door. The door will now open. Go through the
door to enter the Magisterium. As you enter the room, you will see,
floating in the center of the room, a creature that wiggles its tongue
and rolls its eyes. It doesn't look friendly; what does in this house?
DRAG the potted plant to the floor. The Creature will dive for it and
take one of its fruits. Then he will leave you for a while -- better
move quickly!

   The door on the right leads to the Observatory. Though it looks
interesting, ignore it. There's nothing but red herrings there, and you
don't have time for them. The door to the left is locked, and nothing
will open it. OPEN the center door.
 
   Go into the Laboratory. OPEN the safe. The combination is based on the
element numbers from the files you took out of the desk. The order of
the elements is the same as mentioned in the scroll from the cabinet you
found upstairs in the Master Bedroom: GOLD (#79), SILVER (#47), MERCURY
(#80). The combination is 79-47-80.
 
   Inside the safe is a cookie jar. DRAG the COOKIE JAR into your
inventory. The cookie jar is sealed so tight that the only way to open
it will be to break it open. The axe is back inside the House. Go back
out to the Backyard. Hurry! Now re-enter the House. Go through the
Trophy Room, through the Rec Room, through the Hall, back into the
Entrance Hall. OPERATE the axe on the cookie jar. Breaking the cookie
jar reveals a -- oh, no! -- a cookie! Just a damned cookie!
 And after all that running, too! Well, maybe that little creature who's
been running around with that key around his neck will be interested in
the cookie. At least someone will get some pleasure from it. DRAG the
cookie to the floor. The creature will stop and grab the cookie. He will
then return the favor by leaving the key that he wore around his neck on
the floor. DRAG the new key into your inventory.
 
   With the new key, it's time to go back to the Magisterium and see if
the new key will open the locked door. Go back to Magisterium through
the Hall, Rec Room, Trophy Room, Backyard, Magisterium entrance to
finally, the Room. OPERATE the NEW KEY on the door on the left to
unlock, and, ultimately, OPEN the door; and, maybe, find your brother.
  
   What? The key doesn't do anything! Go back through the center door to
the Laboratory. OPEN the Trapdoor that's located under the cauldron.
 
   BEFORE YOU GO THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR, IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SAVE
YOUR GAME!

   Go down through the Trapdoor to enter the Cave. You can't go back it
seems. The shaft is too high, and there is a spider in the upper Cave.
Go through the Cave on the left into the Ice Cave. OPERATE the PENTAGRAM
on the Ice Cave. A strange creature will engulf the ice mass and melt it
to steam.
 
   There will be a human figure that will float to the next Cave. The
robed man prompts you to follow the figure and move quickly. Once in the
next Cave, OPERATE the figure on the pit at the center of the altar. You
have just killed Dracon, but that doesn't save your brother. You aren't
out of hot water just yet!
 
   Go beyond the altar to the Stairway. OPERATE the NEW KEY on the door at
the Top of the Stairs. Now that the door is UNLOCKED, OPEN the door. Go
through the door. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! LISTEN CLOSELY! IS THAT YOUR
BROTHER THAT YOU HEAR YELLING FOR HELP UPSTAIRS?

   Go out of the Study, through the Dining Room, through the Hall, and up
the stairs to the Upstairs Hallway. Go into Dracon's Old Bedroom. OPEN
the door in the upper right. Go into the Bathroom. OPERATE the faucet on
the bathtub. The bathtub will overflow. EXAMINE the light fixture.
Notice that there are handgrips on it?
 
   Too bad you can't reach it. And nothing you can stand on will move for
you. Maybe with all that water flowing out of the bathtub you can float
to the top. The water is climbing fast! Keep on trying to OPEN the light
fixture. With each attempt, the water gets higher.
 
   Finally, you can OPEN the light fixture. Go through the hole in the
ceiling to the Secret Room. Thank God! There he is -- your brother. But
wait a moment he doesn't look too good. What's wrong?

   Suddenly a demon leaps from your brother's body and threatens to take
possession of you. In the meantime, your brother, scared out of his
wits, crashes out the window leaving you to finish off the demon.
OPERATE the cross from the Chapel on the DEMON. The DEMON will fade to
nothingness, leaving no tangible evidence of his having been there.
 
   You still need to check to see if your brother is okay. Go out the
window and -- CONGRATULATIONS! You have saved your brother! Print out
your certificate. You deserve it!

Damn! This file is NOT copyright, so I can NOT remove the rights....
Bleargh, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME .....
Later,

Solution for
MURDER ON THE MISSISSIPPI

Solved by Oistein Ihle, sent by Mr 2703, typed by Martin Brunner
Originally found at http://solutions.c64.org/

The first task involves identification of the body at Nr 4. To do this,
go into cabin 4, then up to the captain and ask him to follow you. Take
him into cabin 4, and after he has told you what he  knows, go out of
the cabin, still with the captain following you. Try to open a cabin
you know is closed (nr1 for example). This action gets the captain to
say "I'll ask Henry to open the door for you" or something like that.
After the captain has said this, Henry will when he is following you.
All closed cabins can be opened in this fashion. This rigmarole is necessary
to open the doors (and getting the clues) to cabins 1 and 16.

To use the list, just go into the room listed and inspect, but before
you inspect always ask the passenger about the victim. This makes them
aware of the situation (you wouldn't be able to inspect the cabin if
you didn't). For example, go to cabin 20, ask Twylla about the victim,
then inspect her cabin. You will find a rosewood box.

Right, here's a list of where clues are to be found:

Rosewood Box: Cabin 20
Colt Pistol: Cabin 15
Cleaning Cotton: Cabin 27
Key to Box: Cabin 1 (left near the pillow of the bed)
Bullet: Cabin 16
To get cabin 1 and 16 open ask Henry to follow
you, then try to open the cabin. Henry will open it for you.

In room 16 a knife comes against you when you open the door. To avoid
it, pull the joystick backwards as you enter. This should help, but
save the game before entering rooms 1 or 16, just in case. In these
rooms the roof may fall down, although it becomes apparent if this is
going to happen when you open the door. If you see something dropping
from the top edge of the door, when entering it pull joystick backward
to go out of door, then try again. If you do not, you die and are forced
to start it all over again! The floor is occasionally weak in cabin
1, so to avoid falling through the floor. Go near the wall until you
are in front of the bed. Now inspect the picture, where the key is hidden.

Drop as many clues as you can in the steamer trunk, Regis' pockets only
take between six and eight clues.

Go to cabin 3, inspect and put key and box on table. It opens, so examine
box, and examine it again (it has a false bottom). In the box there's
a Derringer and a newspaper clipping. Stand outside on the deck between
cabins 4 and 6, inspect and you see something that you can't reach dangling
in the railing. After you have done this, you must go down to the engine
room where Regis sees a gaff.

Getting the gaff is a little tricky, and involves inspecting twice in
the engine room. First Henry allows you to search his cabin. Inspect
for the second time, and Regis sees the gaff, and is able to take it.

After getting the gaff, inspect between cabins 4 and 6 again. This time
you're able to reach the dangling thing, which turns out to be a weapon
stock with chain.

Now the going begins to get tricky. Get all the new and old clues and
go to cabin 3. Inspect, then examine the table: the colt and bullet,
the Derringer and bullet and finally the Derringer and weapon stock.

Now the obvious clues have been solved, but more are needed. Go to Godwin
(cabin 12) and ask about Henry. No notes needed are needed here. Go
to Mdm Des Plaines (cabin 23) and ask about Captain Overbight. Note
this down "I gave him my jewels to keep in save".

After you've done that, ask about Henry, (take no notes) and go up to
Captain Overbight and share the "jewels" note with him.

He opens the safe. Inspect the safe and take the ticket. Go to Mr Humphrey
(cabin 15) and ask him about Mdm Les Plains and Henry. No notes are
needed, so don't take 'em.

Go to the Judge (cabin 9) and ask about Henry. Note this down "He wouldn't
tell me where next stop was". Go to Ms Smallworth and ask her about
Henry. No notes are needed. Share this note with Henry, (Engine Room).
He will answer (and please note this down) "He kept on asking me about
the stops". Ask Henry about Ms Smallworth. No notes are needed. Share
this note with the Captain (at the Wheelhouse). He answers (and note
this down) "Pree said she wanted to mail a letter". Share this note
with Daisy Du Pree (cabin 8). She tells you that the letter is in the
dresser. Inspect the dresser, get the letter and go to cabin 3 to inspect
and examine it, and out comes a mining certificate.

Go to Mr Humphrey (cabin 15) and ask him about Mdm Les Plains. Note
this down: "I'm fond of her unusual perfume". Share this note with Mdm
Les Plains (cabin 23) and she answers (and not this down) "He liked
that cologne Twylla loaned me". Share this not with Ms Smallworth (cabin
20). She answers, "I returned cologne to Daisy Du Pree". Note this down
and ask Ms Smallworth about Henry. No notes are needed. Share this note
with Daisy Du Pree (cabin 8) and she tells you that she has put the
cologne in her dresser. Inspect her dresser, and get the bottle of cologne.

Now go to cabin 3, inspect and then examine the cologne and cotton.

Go down to Henry and ask him about Ms Smallworth. The go to Ms Smallworth
again and ask her about Henry. If you now go to Henry and ask him about
Ms Smallworth again, he calls her Ms Gold... So a connection between
Mr Golden (see Newspaper Clipping) who committed suicide and Ms Smallworth,
who perhaps is his daughter becomes apparent? No notes are needed here.
Accuse Ms Smallworth (cabin 20) and take her to the saloon (cabin 24) and
the complete explanation is displayed, for your delectation.

   NEUROMANCER Solution by Siamak

The following is just one way of going through the game. Of course there are
many variations on the theme.

Start| When you wake up in Ratz restaurant use the PAX. Read the messages. They
will give you some useful info to start with. Download all your credits.
(Always carry all your money with you. I will tell you why later).
Pay your bill, you don't want to get arrested right at the start.

Getting money| You saw a message on PAX from a certain General Armitage. Send
him a message with your ID # (Type:BAMA ID 056306118).
If you check your account, you will find 10000 credits, courtesy of Armitage.
(Remember to download them all)
He also left a message to meet him outside Matrix Restaurant. Go there.
You will never get to meet Armitage but you get arrested when you go to the
rendezvous point.

NOTE: Whenever you get arrested and brought to court do this:

1) Never pay the lawyer fee.
2) Always plea guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. This way
   you never get death penalty. You only get fined.

Whenever you get fined (and it goes up with each additional offense) it will
be deducted from your bank account (on PAX), not from what you are carrying.
That's why I said carry all of your cash with you. Each time you upload credits
to PAX and you have fines outstanding, they will be deducted from your account.
The only danger in carrying your money is that if you die by some misfortune
and get revived at the Body Shop, you will lose all your money. But with usual
precautions (saving game before trying something new) that shouldn't happen.
Later you will find a safe place to put your money.

Do Armitage trick as many times as you can. I don't know how many times you can
do it. I did it twice and that was enough to complete the game. You will find
more money as you go on.
By the way, try not to sell your body parts. If you have to sell to raise cash,
buy them back as soon as you can afford it. You will need all your strength in
Cyberspace.
(In case you are very desperate for money, you can edit your disk to get it. I
will give the necessary info at the end. But try not to use it. It spoils the
game.)

Next go to Shin's Pawn Shop and get your UXB deck. You can start calling
databases using your deck and Comlink 1.0 software and a few link codes you got
from the messages on PAX.
Calling databases is an important part of the game. You will get all kinds of
information off them. You need link codes and passwords to call.
Some of them you get off other DBs, some from the people you meet. By the way
some boards let you get on the first level. It's the higher levels you have to
find passwords for. And there are some levels (DBs as well) you can get to only
in Cyberspace. There are no passwords (or link codes) for them.
Some words you have to decode. If you are unable to decode a word, you need to
upgrade your Cryptology skill.
Some DBs require higher versions of the Comlink for connection.
You also need a Cyberspace jack. They are located at different places. For the
moment use the one at Gentleman Loser or Cheap Hotel.
Later I will give a complete list of DBs and passwords.

Skills: You will need to buy skill chips and then upgrade them.
I figured you will need about 25000 credits to get all the skills and upgrade
them to limit. But you don't have to get them all at once. For the early stage
of the game in Chiba City you only need Cryptology, Coptalk, Musiancianship,
Bargaining, Software analysis and maybe Debug and Hardware repair.

Now let's explore Chiba City. I will tell you what to ask people and what you
can get at each location. The things you can ask a character you will find at
different places. The game doesn't necessarily proceed in the order given.

Massage Parlor: Tell the girl you want to buy info. You can buy five of them.
(You will get arrested and fined each time, but be persistent)

Microsofts: Ask Larry Moe about SEA, Matrix, Cyberspace, ROM, ROM Constructs,
Coptalk, Skill, Chip, Fuji, Police, Comlink, Code.
Some answers will be repetitive. Buy Coptalk skill. Implant it.
At the back room of Microsofts is the Panther Moderns HQ. You can't get to it
yet.

Donut World (near Body Shop): Use Coptalk skill to imitate a cop. You will get
a few link codes and passwords (some coded). Later when you get your Coptalk
skill upgraded visit again. You will get some more bits of info.

Gentleman Loser: Ask Shiva about Cryptology (a message on PAX told you to pick
it up here, remember?), Chip, Skill, Bargaining, Pshycoanalysis, Phenomenology,
Philosophy, Teach, Upgrade, Train, Instruct, ROM, ROM Construct, Software, AI,
Neuromancer, Loser, Wilson, Hitachi, Copenhagen, University, Matrix, Guest,
Pass, Norton, Emperor.
Again some answers are repetitive.
Get Cryptology chip. Buy hardware repair if you can afford it. Get guest pass
for Matrix restaurant.

Julius Dean (across from Maas Biolabs): Ask Julius about: most of what you ask
Shiva at Gentleman Loser,plus these: Screaming Fist, Fuji, IRS, Hosaka, Tozoku,
Musabori, Hitachi, Exotic/Hardware, Wintermute, Tessier-Ashpool.
You will get link codes and passwords. Buy and upgrade skills as much as you
can afford. Buy gas mask.

Now call a few databases. Use the jack in Gentleman Loser. You can't use the
Cheap Hotel until you pay your bill.

Call REGFELLOW. Get passwords. Dowload BattleChess 2.0, Scout 1.0.
Scout lets you find out how many levels a DB has. Otherwise it's not very
useful. To use it, when you connect to a DB and opening screen appears hit "I"
and choose Scout 1.0.

Call ASANOCOMP. Get a few link codes.

Call CHEAPO. Edit your bill on second level or pay it if you prefer.
Order caviar. Edit bill. Go to Cheap Hotel to pick it up.

Call WORLDCHESS. You can play in chess tournament using BattleChess 2.0 and
win a few hundred. Otherwise don't bother.

Call CONSUMEREV only if you have money to burn. It gives a review of all decks.
A very long list.

Now hit the streets again. If you meet Lonny Zone's girl along the way ask her
about: Lonny Zone, Microsofts, Hardware, Software, Hitachi, Justice, Law,
Lawyer, Judge, Cyberspace, Matrix, Massage. Not all of her answers are helpful.

Metro Holographix: Ask Finn about Chip, Skill, Debug, Ice breaking, ROM, ROM
Construct, Holy/Joystick, Software, Neuromancer, Wintermute, Tessier-Ashpool,
AI, Screaming Fist, Pong.
Buy skill chips and joystick. Don't buy any software as you can download all
of the software he has off DBs.

Crazy Edo's: Trade caviar for Comlink 2.0 software. Delete Comlink 1.0. (When
you get a higher version of Comlink delete the old one. You don't need it).
Don't buy any decks here. You get them cheaper at Asano Computing.

Asano Computing: Here you can buy better decks or ask about different decks.
He will tell you which ones are Cyberspace capable. You don't need a Cyberspace
deck yet.
If you bad mouth Crazy Edo you will get some discount.
The best non-Cyberspace decks are Ninja 3000 and Edokko, the best Cyberspace
ones are Ninja 5000, Samurai Seven and Cyberspace VII. Any one of them will do.

House of Pong: Listen to the ramblings of the monk and you will find what he
wants. Give him joystick and get Zen and Sophistry chips in return.

Matrix Restaurant (need guest pass to enter): Ask Norton about Anonymous/Bosch,
Matt Shaw, ROM/Construct, Dixie, Skill, Chip, Upgrade, Teach, Train, any skill
by name, Password, Loser, ESFA, NASA, AI.
Buy and upgrade skills as much as you can or come back later. Note all the
passwords you get.

Now go back to Cheap Hotel and call databases.

Call CHAOS. Get Comlink 3.0. Read messages. You will get quite a few hints.

Call FUJI. You will find Larry Moe is a consultant. Note his ID number.

Call HITACHIBIO, PSYCHO, IRS if you like. Not much of interest here.

Call BRAINSTORM. Read messages. You will find out which ICE breakers are best.

Call SOFTEN. Get Comlink 4.0. Upgrade Coptalk skill. Get Sequenser 1.0.
Sequencer 1.0 is used to find password of any DB (first level only). Use it
the same way as Scout 1.0. Use it on any board you don't have password for.
On some bases this is the only way to get in.
(After upgrading Coptalk visit Donut World again).

Call KEISATSU (Tactical Police). On second level edit the warrant list and put
in Larry Moe's name and ID. He vanishes (presumably arrested) and you can get
to Panther Moderns in the back room of his shop.

Panther Moderns: Ask Lupus about Sense/Net, Security/Pass, ROM/Construct, Chip,
Skill, Evasion, Bank, GemeinSchaft, Tozoku, any skill by name, Upgrade etc.,
Software, Easy Rider, Wilson, Hitachi, AI, Fuji, Hosaka, Musabori, Matrix,
Guest pass, Restaurant, Cyberspace.
He will give you a bank account number to get money from. Buy evasion chip and
security pass if you can afford it or wait until later.

Back to Cheap Hotel and calling databases.

Call LOSER. Read messages. You get a code for cracking bank. Download software:
Probe 3.0 and Hammer 1.0 on level 2.

Call FREEMATRIX if you like. You can't download any software. They are phony.
And don't bother with Blammo 1.0. (A message on LOSER warned you about this).
It's a Trojan horse. When you fire Blammo at ICE in Cyberspace, it rebounds and
hits you.

Call EASTSEABOD. Get Comlink 5.0. Read messages.

Call YAKUZA. Get Comlink 6.0, Blowtorch 1.0 and Decoder 1.0.

Call MUSABORIND and VOYAGER. Nothing of interest here.

Call JUSTTICE. You have to use Sequencer to get on. Nothing of interest anyway.

If you have survived by now, it's time to get some more money.

Call HOSAKACORP. Upload Comlink 6.0 to their library and you will get 7500
credits. (Can do this only once).
On level 2 edit the employee list and add your name and ID number. Then you can
go to Hosaka office and collect weekly paycheck of 10000.
You can do this every 7 days by game clock, which is about 6 hours of real
time. (If you don't pause the game).

Call BOZOBANK. Use Sequencer to get in. Open an account. Account number will be
712345450134.

Call BANKGEMEIN. On second level transfer fund from account 646328356481 to the
acount you opened at BOZOBANK. You get 30000 this way.

Call BOZOBANK and get money if you need. By the way this is the safe place to
keep all your dough, immune from court fines and the butcher at Body Shop.

These are all the databases you can call. Now go to Asano Computing and buy the
best Cyberspace deck you can and also buy/upgrade all remaining skills.
You should still have a few thousands credits left.

A few other places you can visit. You have already been to company offices in
the High Tech part of Chiba City when you collected your paycheck. Tell the
security computer you work for Hosaka to get in. You can't get into the offices
if you enter as a volunteer to sell yourlungs (and you don't want to do that
anyway).
There is a Cyberspace jack in each office. Also in Sense/Net office you can get
a ROM. (You have to have a security pass). You get ROM numbers from a DB in
Cyberspace. So come back for it later.

Maas Biolabs: You can't get in there until late in the game. When you unlocked
the door and turned off the alarm from Cyberspace, put on the gas mask and
enter. You can have a CyberEyes chip implanted. It functions the same as a
Cyberspace capable deck. It has more RAM so you can store up to 32 softwares
compared to 25 for best decks.

Zion Cluster and Freeside: From Chiba City airport you can ride a shuttle to
either Zion Cluster or Freeside.

Zion Cluster: Ask the man about Bank/Banking, Wintermute, Gemeinschaft, Music,
Dub, Freeside, Zion and Maelcum.
You get the code for vault in Gemeinschaft bank. Use Musicianship skill and
play music. Play Dub and you will get a free ride to Freeside aboard Maelcum's
spaceship. Keep playing other music and he will pay for your return to Chiba
City.
Ask Maelcum the same questions, but you get pretty much the same answers.

Freeside: Here are the offices of Bank of Bern and Gemeinschaft and Villa
Straylight. Each has a Cyberspace jack. The code to enter vault is BG1066.
Stay away from Villa Straylight as it drains your constitution. You only need
to use the jack in manager's office at bank of Bern. About that later.

Well, That's about all you can do in Chiba City and suburbs. Now it's time to
hit Cyberspace where real fun begins!

But first here is a complete list of databases. They are listed by name, link
code, number of levels ,passwords for each level and the lowest version of
Comlink needed for connection. If password for a level is not given, you can
reach that level through Cyberspace only.

    Database name          Link code   Lvls    Password(s)      Comlink version

Cyberspace

Cyberspace consists of 8 Zones, 0 to 7. Each zone has a number of databases
protected by ICE. Some of them have a resident AI. You enter a database, break
the ICE and kill the AI if any. You should start at Zone 0 which has weakest
ICE and AI and go on in order. After each Zone your skills go up, which you need
to tackle the higher Zone.

Each Zone can be entered at a different Cyberspace jack. You need a Cyberspace
deck (or CyberEyes) and Comlink 6.0 or Cyberspace 1.0 (found later).
The location of jack for each Zone:
Zone 0 - Cheap Hotel
Zone 1 - Gentleman Loser
Zone 2 - Fuji, Hitachi, Hosaka and Musabori offices.
Zone 3 - Bank of Bern
Zone 4 - Sense/Net office.
Zone 5 - Gemeinschaft Bank vault.
Zone 6 - None.
Zone 7 - Villa Straylight

You can get to Zone 6 through Cyberspace only. You will find KGB and Easy Rider
softwares in Zone 3. KGB takes you from any Zone to KGB database in Zone 6.
Easy Rider lets you cross Zone boundaries. After you find it just use the jack
at Cheap Hotel to get to Zone 0 and then use Easy Rider to go to other Zones.

The following are ICE cracking wares:

ICE breakers - Good  : Decoder, Blowtorch, Hammer
               Better: Doorstop, Drill
               Best  : Concrete, DepthCharge, LogicBomb
Interface Corruptors - Slow and Jammies. They jam and slow the firing of the
ICE. Slow is the better one.
Viruses - Injector, Acid, Python, ThunderHead. Unlike other wares they get used
up and you have to get new supplies. Also they have a limited lifetime. If
the effect of a virus runs out (the ICE turns blue) fire another virus.
Injectors are the best.
Shielding - Armorall. Whenever your shield is about to run out, use Armorall to
raise your shield. Armorall 1.0 can be use once, Armorall 2.0 twice and so on.
Carry a few versions.

You start with some basic wares which are enough for Zone 0. As you go on you
will find more powerful wares. Always get rid of lower version when you find
higher version of a program (except for Armorall) or your deck will become
full. Carry six different ICE breakers at any time. Not that you need that many
, but because some might crash during combat.

ICE breaking techniques: When you enter a base just keep hitting "I" so you can
get the maximum number of shots in. Fire in the following sequence:

1) Slow or Jammies (if you have them). Only once.
2) A Virus (if you have them). Fire virus as needed whenever ICE turns blue.
3) Cycle through your ICE breakers from strongest to weakest.
4) Use Armorall as needed to raise shield (if you have them).

You can use Probe to get some info about a DB, but it might cost you one round
of battle. The best way to use it is to fire when you first enter a DB, and
when you get the info exit and then reenter for combat. By the way, always save
the game before entering a new base.

Watch ICE strength bar at right at all times. If it's close to zero and you are
about to be flatlined, don't panic. Continue fighting. Chances are the ICE will
crack before you do.

AI combat: If a base has an AI you have to fight and kill it. AI killing skills
are Logic, Phenomenology, Philosophy and Sophistry.
First use Psychoanalysis to find out what the AI's weakness is.
Then following sequence:

1) Use weakness skill.
2) Rotate among other three skills in a fixed order.
3) Go to step 1.

Whenever you are about to be flatlined (life indicator turns red) use Zen skill
to raise your constitution and then resume battle from where you left it.
Use Evasion skill to get out if situation becomes too hot to handle.

If Psychoanalysis says unknown weakness, try it again. A couple of AIs you can
kill in a special manner explained later.

After finishing one base always exit Cyberspace to repair damage, debug crashed
programs and let your constitution reach maximum again before going on to the
next base. Specially early bases when you don't have powerful wares yet.

The following are complete list of databases found in each Zone. They include
coordinates, name, AI (if any) and what software or item of interest they might
contain. For each base there is also a list of wares in parenthesis which can
be used for cracking the ICE in that base. These are for the first time you
enter a base. Later when you find more powerful wares in higher Zones, you will
find it much easier to crack ICE in lower Zones. I do not claim that these are
the best combinations, they are just the ones I found effective. Experiment
with different combinations to find the best. I recommend going to bases in the
order given, at least in lower Zones.

 This is the final battle. After you break through the ICE, Neuromancer will
 send you to a prison island. Cycle through your skills (Logic, Phenomenology,
 Philosophy and Sophistry) until you are out and back to this DB again.
 Fire Kuang Eleven prg at it, and then cycle through above skills in a fixed
 order until you kill it. I have killed it using many different combinations
 of skills, but this is the most straightforward. Don't forget to use Zen
 skill as needed.

                         Neuromancer Code Wheel

         First, a short explanation of the evolution of code wheels.  The code
wheel is a form of protection against piracy of a particular game.  They first
appeared (to my knowledge) in the Electronic Arts game Amnesia in the form of
a "street index".  The next appearance was much later, in Legacy of the
Ancients, also EA.  The third (and most complicated one) was included in Bards
Tale III.  And, as you may have guessed, the latest use is in Neuromancer. The
first two also included disk protection, but the companies seem to be relying
on just the code wheel for their protection against piracy, as the last two
have had no disk protection whatsoever.  The protection comes when, at certain
points in the game, you will be given a set of two, three or four (depending
on the complexity of the wheel) words or locations or whatever, and, using the
code wheel, you must provide the required answer, or you will not be able to
proceed with that function.  Without the wheel and without altering the
programming of the disk, you are stuck.

         What is a code wheel?  It is two or three concentric paper circles,
each one smaller than the one beneath it, so that only the outer ring of the
larger one(s) shows.  It is on the outer ring that one set of words are
printed.  On the outside edge of the smallest circle can be found the second
set of words. One or several small windows are also cut out of the smallest
circle (and in the case of three wheels, windows may also be cut out of the
middle wheel at random points) so that the requested code numbers or words may
be seen through them.  If there is more than one window, each window will have
its own name printed above or below it.  In the most simple application, the
use would be something like this: the player is given the conditions of A and
B.  He would rotate the code wheel until A on the outer circle lines up with B
on the inner circle and observe the code through through the window.  In the
case of multiple windows, he would have been given A, B, and C, rotated as
before to line up A and B and look through window C for the answer.  Such is
the case with Neuromancer.

         The code wheel in Neuromancer is used to operate the PAX machine
found at various locations throughout the game.  You will be given three
access codes and asked for a verification code.  There are 16 possible A's,
B's and C's.  The codes are broken down into two tables.  The first tables
gives A (outer ring) and B (inner ring), to be cross referenced to each other
to get a position number. This position number will be cross referenced with C
(windows) to give the 3 to 6 digit verification code.  The access codes you
will be given are listed below with THREE LETTERS IN UPPER CASE (usually the
first three, but not always, so I have tried to draw your attention to the

    Blue Key can only be used once but has TWO possible uses! Opening the
    door before you, to rescue the Princess and return her to old misery
    guts, OR opening a safe that you have yet to locate. There are no
    points to be gained by rescuing the Princess, but you NEED to open the
    safe and then vote for maximum points, so forget the Princess. If you
    want to go ahead and rescue the old girl, then follow the
    'mini-solution' at the end of the main solution).

			  GAME CONQUERED BY BAGPUSS
			 ON Tue Aug 18 22:41:01 1992

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    WARNING! This solution is not for the faint-hearted or the squeamish.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1) Leave the producers office and walk downstairs and out of the building.
   Walk down the street to the Hub Cap Bar.
2) Once inside talk to to woman sitting at the bar,she'll mention the name
   of the street where Bela used to to live.Talk to the barman and buy the
   bottle of rum.
3) Go back into the  foyer and go  upstairs  into the producers office, he 
   should have gone by now. Examine his desk and you'll find a key-its for
   the editing room.
4) Go into his private room and examine the pictures on the back  wall. In
   particular the  one on the far left, you should  discover an address on
   one of them - Lot 9,Pleasant Rest,Highgate.
5) Then go downstairs  and talk to the doorman, ask him to call you a cab.
   Then go outside and  climb into  the cab.Tell the cabbie to take you to
   Lot 9,Pleasant Rest,Highgate.
6) Once you arrive go into the cemetery and enter the crypt.Examine Bela's
   body to  discover  a door key and pick up the hammer.
7) Climb back into the cab and go to  Vlad Street. Enter  the house and go
   into the study.
8) Examine  the flyer on  the  table next to  the books,its an  advert for  
   the local mall. Pick up the pictures of Bela also on the table.
9) Examine the trophies  hanging up on the back  wall. Try pushing the one 
   on the left-a credit card should fall out.
10)Leave the house and take the cab to the Mega-Mall.
11)Press the elavator  call button. When the doors open walk inside and go
   to floor number 2.
12)Leave the lift  and  enter  the Lycanthropository (huh??) Buy the scary
   mask.(Pay for everything you buy with the credit card).
13)Examine  the mask - you'll find a note and a small key (read the note).
14)Go to  floor number 3 and  go into Ted's Travel Agents and buy a ticket
   to Rio.
15)Then go to floor number 5 and go into the  hardware  store. Talk to the
   assistant  say..... "Nice day for gatherin' corn." then  buy the spade.
   (you'll have to examine the  tool you want  to buy first)  then use the
   passport with  the photocopier  and you'll get a copy of  your passport
   photograph.
16)Finally,go to floor number 6 and enter the bank. Talk to the teller and
   change some of your money into the currencies of Washington,Brazil,Hong
   Kong and Australia. Examine  the credit  card and  jot down the  number
   which is scribbled on  the back of it,it should be 350143. Hand the key
   which you found in the scary mask to the teller,she'll ask you for your
   safety deposit box number select 530143.
17)Open the safety deposit box and take the reel of film,examine it and it
   should have `WUN' on it. (If you want to watch the reels of film to see
   whats on  them you can either go to the editing room in the  studio  or
   go to any of the projection booths scattered throughout the game,simply
   give the guy the film.Theres a cinema on floor number 4).
18)Leave the mall and go to the cemetery for a spot of`Grave-digging'.Walk
   around the  cemetery until you  find a grave  with a wooden  cross as a 
   headstone with  the  name J Harris  on it. Use the  spade to dig up the
   grave-you'll  need to  use the spade  three  times before  you find the
   second reel of film.This reel should be marked `OF'.
19)Now go to the airport. Give the rep. the ticket and board the plane. Go
   inside to cockpit and talk to the pilot (the one on the right). Ask him
   if he knows a place to stay. Remember his name is Steve Peters.
20)Once you  arrive in Rio  jump in the cab and  you will be taken to  the 
   hotel.   
21)Remember the pilot said he left something behind  when he stayed  here?
   well examine the registration book to find out what room he  stayed in.
   Then ask for a room, when she asks you  what room  you want ask her for 
   the same room Steve Peters stayed in.
22)Once youve got the room key go upstairs to your room. Pick up the pilot
   ID off the table. Examine it to find out his address -  21 Aviation Way
   Studio Town.
23)Replace his photograph  on his  ID with the one of you, the one you got
   when you used the photocopier with your passport.
24)Then go into the cave at the beach. The bats should take the picture of
   Bela of you and leave you alone. Pick up the third reel of film, marked
   `LO'.
25)Go back to the airport where a group of not so friendly security guards
   will grab you and take you to the police station.
26)Dont bother trying to bribe the  guard it wont  work,after the somewhat
   unfair trial you'll end up in a prison cell.
27)Give the  bottle of rum to  the prison guard and he'll  leave  the room
   giving you the chance to escape..he'll drop a statue before he  leaves,
   pick it up.If you try hitting it you'll discover that it is hollow, use
   the hammer on the statue to break it open,you'll find a slimy DeathHead
   moth pupa.
28)Once youve escaped go to the airport and give the rep your ticket. Once
   you get back home get a cab to Avaition Way.
29)O.k,to get into the house use the credit card to open the door.Once you
   are inside pick up the scuba gear (you'll  have to drop some stuff) and
   then go  into the back  garden where you'll find the forth reel of film
   marked `property'.
30)Alrighty,go  to the studios store room and pick up the love beads. Then
   take a cab to the airport.
31)Give the pilot ID to the rep. and select Australia as your destination,
   then simply board the plane.
32)Go to the beach and talk to the sexy bather,say "Hi there,nice weather"
   then  ask her if she would like the love beads. She'll say yes and show
   you a path leading to a hippy commune.
33)Then fly back home and go to the building site,talk to the 2 guys about
   the hippy commune.Then go to the diner and pick up the balloon. Go back
   to the  store  room in the studio  and pick up the dictionary. Fly back
   to Australia and go to the hippy commune.Talk to the  two hippy's about
   Fred  and they'll  give you a reel of film he left  behind..it's marked
   `H.K'.
34)Way to go dude,you've only got one more reel to find, exciting isnt it?
35)Go to the bridge and talk to  the painter  you'll walk  over to him and 
   slip,falling off the bridge and into the water.  Quickly  use the scuba
   gear before you drown. Pick up the crow bar and then  use balloon  with
   the scuba gear,you'll then shoot to the surface!

   tell you about the netsuke which has been stolen from him.
37)Fly to Washington  and talk to the chief,he'll send you on an important
   mission in Cuba.When you are standing on the  wharf the guard  will say
   say  something  to you, to   understand what  he is saying examine  the 
   dictionary. After a  long chat  he'll  give you a box of  cigars and  a 
   poster.
38)Go back to Washington and see the chief,give him the box  of cigars and
   the poster.He'll then tell you to go to the Smithsonian Institution.
39)The taxi driver will automatically drive you there,when you arrive give

                         Personal Nightmare

The village of Tynham Cross, nestled in the hills of Woldshire, holds many
memories for you.  Brought up a vicar's son, life was very quiet in this sleepy
little village.  In order to pursue a more interesting career opportunity you
left home many years ago and lost contact with your parents.  consequently a
letter from your mother came like a bolt from the blue.  The letter troubled you,
you didn't know why but it seemed to be trying to tell you something.  On the
surface it was just an ordinary letter form a mother trying to re-establish
contact with her son but underneath there seemed to be something wrong, very wrong.
Perhaps it was the reference to your father's strange behavior.  According to your
mother, your father, the local vicar, has started behaving very strangely and has
developed a keen interest in the life story of James Hyatt, vicar at the Church of
St. Anthony some three hundred years earlier.  Your memories of this particular
character remain pretty vague but you do remember something about him being
killed by his own parishioners, apparently in some bizarre ritual to rid the
village of some devil or the other.  Of course such events were fairly common in
those times for it was during that period in history that the great witch hunts
were going on, and even something as simple as failed crop usually resulted in
some poor woman being burned at the stake or drowned in the village pond. 
Anyway, the tome of the letter seemed to beg you to come home and you have made
preparations to visit as soon as possible.  A second letter received only the
day before your visit alarms you even further.  More a message than a letter, it
came form your father advising that he had made arrangements for you to stay at
the local inn.  The Dong and Duck, as he was having the house redecorated and
didn't think that the work would be completed in time for your visit.  He had
added that your mother's sister, Alice, had been taken ill and was currently
bedridden and that your mother had gone to visit her in Campbelthrope, hoping to
return in time for your visit.  He also enclosed a brief brochure about the inn. 
You have taken the train and during the long journey have fallen asleep.

IBM instructions:

1. Insert Disk 1 in A Drive.
2. Type A: and then press return
3. Type install and answer the questions.  The install program will create a
   directory on C: called Horror.
4. Type PN while in the C: sub-directory Horror and the program will run.
5. From floppies, put Disk 1 in A drive and then type PN
6. A mouse maybe used.
7. The number key pad will move in the general direction of the key, ie. 9
   will move you to the right at 45 degrees.
8. 0=the left hand mouse button.
9. +=the right hand mouse button.

The object of the game is to defeat the power of the devil that has taken over
the lives of some of the residents of the village.  You will need to identify who
these characters are and then, by presenting the village policemen with evidence
of their horrific crimes, have them arrested.  You will also meet and have to
deal with one or two little pets belonging to the devil and in case you get bored
there are one or two people who need rescuing before they are used at some rather
unpleasant rituals.

The game can be controlled by use of the mouse, although on some occasions it
will be necessary for you to input some commands via the use of the keyboard. 
The game may also be played entirely by the use of the keyboard.  The main area
on the screen will graphically display the location you are in and the events
taking place within it.  The right hand panel is the command window.  The left
hand panel is the movement window.  The window directly beneath these is the text
response window and the bottom line is the text input window.  If you wish to
examine something on the screen, then the examine command should be selected from
the right hand window, by use of the mouse pointer.  You will notice that the
word examine has appeared in the text input window.  Alternatively, just type in
the word examine by pointing to the object or the character person displayed on
the screen and pressing the left hand mouse button.  Again, you will notice the
name of the object or person displayed in the text input window.  Your text input
window will now read something like examine bugle, this can now be selected by
either pressing the right hand mouse or alternatively by pressing return on the
keyboard.  The description, or appropriate response of the person or object will
be displayed in the text response window.  Should you wish to pick up an object
from the action window, then select the pick up command from the right hand
window and then select the item on screen.  Alternatively, if the item can be
picked up, then when the left hand mouse button is held down the mouse pointer
will change to a hand and by dragging the item to the inv box the item will be
placed in your inventory.

To display your inventory select the inv icon with the mouse.  The screen will
display icons of the objects that you are carrying.  Some of these objects may be
containers.  To view the contents of them, double click the icon of the container
object and the contents will be displayed.  These objects can be removed from the
container by selecting them with the mouse and dragging them to the inv icom.  To
exit the inventory mode select exit form the line displayed above the icons.

It is also possible to list the visible takable objects in any location by
selecting the icon marked room.  This will display on screen icons representing
all the items that can currently be removed from that location and again by
holding the mouse over the item required and then pressing the left button until
a hand appears, it is possible to transfer these item to your inventory.  

Similarly, should you wish to drop an item you will have to either select the
drop command from the right hand panel or the inv icon from the left hand panel. 
Once the inventory screen is displayed, then the item to be dropped is picked up
with the left hand mouse and place into the room icon.

Should you wish to examine an object you are carrying then just select the item
from the inventory with one click of the left hand mouse button and the items
description will be displayed in the text window at the bottom of the screen.  To
move around the game you may select any of the lit compass points or up and down
arrows in the left hand panel.  This will result in your moving to the location
in that direction.  Movement in that direction is prevented by someone or
something e.g. a locked door.  Movement is also possible by selecting, with the
mouse, any visible door on the action screen.  If the door is locked and providing
that you have the key, the door will be unlocked.  A second selection of the door
will open it and a third will allow you to pass through it.

Other commands you may find useful are:

Ask (character) about (character).
Ask (character) about (object)-Be careful with this one as it may have unfortunate
consequences.
Ask (character) about (event).

In order to complete the game it is necessary to show various pieces of evidence
to the policeman.

Mr. Roberts-Registrar of Births and Deaths.

Jimmy Blandford-A professional Photographer who enjoyed a good drink.
Susan Blandford-The pretty wife of Jimmy Blandford.

Personal Nightmare Hints

1.  Early In The Game-accidents do happen and require close examination.

    heard and all arms were lost.
3.  Cat a Nuisance-Playful creatures aren't they?

    would have been better employed elsewhere.  On reflection this may lead to   
    other problems.

    collection.
7.  Having A Problem With A Dog-An old chestnut this one, first thought for a    
    vampire perhaps.
8.  Haunted?-Don't get angry, stay cross.
9.  Registry Office Locked-A drinking partner perhaps, watch his every move.
10. Gardener Seems Over Zealous About His Duties-Patience is a virtue.
11. Can't Get Into The Garage-Search a wreak.
12. General Advice-The policeman is an arresting officer.  Being recognized at

    talk to people.

Welcome  to  POLICE  QUEST II.  Things haven't changed much  since  our  last 
adventure.  Other  than  your having been promoted to Detective  in  Homicide 
division,  and Lytton Police Station undergoing extensive remodeling, all has 
been quiet. Oh yes, one major change: You no longer have to maneuver your car 
through  the  streets of Lytton;  that nightmare has been removed  in  POLICE 
QUEST II.


     LYTTON POLICE STATION AND LOCKER

Get into your car,  open the glove compartment,  take the business card,  and 
read both sides.  Hm, I wonder what that number could be? TAKE THE KEYS. Now, 
go into the Police Station.

Enter  your  office (that's the door on the upper left).  Read  the  bulletin 
board on the rear wall. Well, you are going to have to improve your shooting. 
Walk over to your desk in the middle of the room.  Sit down. Open the drawer. 
Take and read the letter.  Take your wallet.  Now to get your gear. Leave the 
room,  and  go  into the door on the back wall (to the left of  the  evidence 
window).  Your  locker is the first one on the left wall.  Open  the  locker. 
What?  You don't know the combination?  What do you think that number on  the 
back of the business card was? Open your locker. Wow! Look at that picture of 
Marie: What a girl! Get your gun, ammo, and handcuffs. Close the locker.

     ADJUSTING YOUR GUN

Now,  to  improve your shooting.  Go right.  Get ear protection from the  guy 
standing outside the booth,  then go in.  (On the IBM keyboard, F6 loads your 
gun,  F8  draws  gun,  and F10 fires gun -- this may be  different  on  other 
keyboards. Read the card enclosed with the game.)

Aim  at the target and fire three shots.  Now press the  view  button.  Those 
bullets were well off the mark.  You're going to have to adjust your  sights. 
Type ADJUST SIGHTS.  Use the cursor keys to move the screws in the  direction 
you need.  Move it a few turns, that hit enter. That target is full of holes, 
so CHANGE TARGET.  Press the back button.  Now practice shooting  again.  You 
might  have to repeat this step a few times to perfect it.  You'll  know  you 
have it right when you get points for firing at the center of the target.  If 
you run out of ammo, get more from the man outside.

     COMPUTER PASSWORDS AND BAINS MUGSHOT

Go back to your office. Jessie Bains, the "Death Angel" (whom you risked your 
life to capture),  has escaped!  Your job:  Find him!  Look at the  Captain's 
table, and read the papers. Remember those passwords; you'll need them later. 
Go to the filing cabinet on the right.  Get the file on Bains,  and take  the 
mugshot.  You could do with a better one than that though;  that one is  left 
over from POLICE QUEST I! You'd better go to the Jail to gather information.

Take the keys from the rear wall.  On your way out,  pick up your field  kit. 
Where is it?  In the storage bin of course!  Where is that?  Oh,  it's on the 
wall  on the right,  opposite the evidence window,  where it can't  be  seen! 
Obvious,  isn't it?  In your car, RADIO DISPATCH. They like to know where you 
are (even detectives aren't trusted!).

     ADDITIONAL POINTS

ADJUSTING YOUR GUN:  Make certain you use up all of your ammo on the shooting 
range. This will allow you to "REQUEST AMMO" for 2 points. Also, don't forget 
to "RETURN THE EAR PROTECTORS."





OTHER THINGS: At some time, look in your basket for 1 point. Also, you should 
use the computer a little at this point.  Use "DIR" to get  directories,  and 
"CD" to change directories;  sometimes you will need to enter passwords.  You 
should  go into the Personnel directory and read Pratt's file.  Don't  forget 
your passwords,  though, as you'll need to get into the Vice directory later. 
After reading Pratt's file, go "ASK PRATT ABOUT DRUGS" for another 5 points.

     JAIL

Go to the jail door. Put your gun in the locker (you remember that from PQ I, 
don't you?).  Press button. Even the jail has been remodeled. Now you have to 
show your ID and pose in front of the closed-circuit camera!  Oh  well,  into 
the jail.  Ask about Bains. Take the new mugshot from his file. Now ask about 
the kidnapped officer.  Read his file.  Ask about the getaway car. That's it. 
Out you go.  (Don't forget your gun!) Radio dispatch.  You're told there's  a 
stolen car located in the Mall. Drive to the Mall.

     MALL

At the mall,  get your kit from the trunk.  Open the car door.  Examine  car. 
Dust for prints.  Look in glove compartment. Talk to the woman. Ask her about 
her car.  There doesn't seem to be much else here (the game won't let you  go 
shopping <sigh>).

     COTTON COVE AND MURDER EVIDENCE

A jogger reported violence at Cotton Cove!  You know that place; you had some 
fun  there back in PQ I.  (I wonder if it's been remodeled,  too?)  Get  your 
field kit.  Talk to the girl,  and ask her what happened.  She tells you that 
she saw blood marks,  You'd better check that out.  Go to the left.  Look  in 
garbage can.  Get the clothing.  Watch out for that car!  Look on the ground. 
Now to gather the evidence:  Take pictures,  get a blood sample,  and use the 
plaster on the footprint.

     DIVING, BODY, BADGE, AND KNIFE

Diving?  That's  part of the fun of being in Homicide!  Show the  diver  your 
diving certificate.  You don't have one?  Try looking in your wallet!  Now to 
change  into  diving gear.  Go into the van.  Put everything on  (except  the 
second set of flippers,  of course).  Look at each air tank, and take the one 
with the most air.  Now go and dive. Get the badge (in the middle screen) and 
the  knife  (to  the left of the screen).  The body is to the  right  of  the 
screen,  on the right, behind a rock. Up you go, hauling the body between the 
pair of you. Change your clothing, go back to your car, and (as if you didn't 
know) radio dispatch!

     ADDITIONAL POINTS

JAIL:  In  addition  to all the things mentioned in the  main  walkthru,  you 
should  also "ASK JAILER ABOUT KIDNAPPING." Then,  you can "ASK SAXTON  ABOUT 
KIDNAPPING." You may replace "kidnapping" with "escape" if you prefer.

MALL: When dusting for prints in the car, make certain you dust the glove box 
before  you  open it.  "DUST GLOVE BOX FOR FINGERPRINTS," then "USE  TAPE  ON 
GLOVE BOX." Be sure that you get the holster and bullets from the glove  box, 
as well.  After talking to the woman,  return to your car, "RADIO ABOUT GUN," 
and "RADIO ABOUT CAR" for a total of 3 points.

COTTON COVE: After talking to the jogger and asking her about blood or marks, 
walk  one screen to the left.  While still on the right edge of  the  screen, 
draw your gun.  Proceed left.  When Bains appears,  fire.  After scaring him, 
holster the gun,  and stay off the road.  Once the car goes racing by,  it is 
safe to proceed to the next screen to the left.  But better than that, return 
to your car and radio.  Then proceed two screens to the left.  After  getting 
the clothing, be sure to examine it, and read nametag (2 points).

     AIRPORT, STOLEN CAR, FLOWERS, AND GUN

Another stolen car has been seen in the vicinity of the airport.  Off you go. 
The  car  is  at the bottom right of the parking  lot.  Examine  car.  Get  a 
fingerprint  from  the rear view mirror by dusting  the  mirror,  then  using 
fingerprint tape.  Go over to the airport.  Press the button before crossing 
the  street!  (Didn't  your mother teach you that?) Wait for  a  few  seconds 
outside the airport, and buy flowers for Marie from the woman. What flower do 
you want? Why, a rose, of course!

Go into the airport and talk to the agent.  If the agent is busy,  show  your 
badge.  Ask about Bains, show the mugshot, and ask to see the passenger list. 
You're told that flight left 20 minutes ago. Looks like the bird got away! Go 
to the bathroom.  You don't need to go,  but do it anyway.  Enter the  middle 
stall.  Look at toilet,  open toilet,  and look in toilet. (Get that look off 
your face!) Flush the toilet,  get gun,  and leave. Go back to your car, and, 
yes, you guessed it: Radio dispatch.

     THE STATION, MARIE, COMPUTER, AND OFF DUTY

Drive back to the Police Station.  Book the evidence at the window, and go to 
your  office.  Look  in your basket.  Marie wants you to call.  To  find  her 
number,  call 411.  You don't know her last name (better not tell her that -- 
she'd be very upset!),  so go to the computer.  (You didn't know Sierra  made 
hardware,  did you?) Type DIR for directory,  and CD to change directory. You 
have  the passwords (they were written on the papers on the Captain's  desk). 
Go  to the "vice" directory,  (Marie was a prostitute in PQ I,  and a  record 
always  remains.)  When you find her name,  go back and  call  411,  get  her 
number, and call her.

You have a date tonight now.  (For a good laugh, use the phone to call Sierra 
Customer Service (209) 683-6858, and Sierra BBS (209) 683-4463). Put the keys 
back on the wall.  Put your gun, ammo, and cuffs back in the locker. Put your 
field kit back in its storage bin. You're now off duty.

     RESTAURANT

Take your own car and drive to the restaurant.  Marie is waiting for you. Sit 
down.  Talk to Marie. Give her the rose. Kiss her. (That was good, wasn't it? 
And you got 2 points for it,  too!) Kiss her again (for an extra point), call 
the waiter, and order food. (Yep, good food does take a while.) Eat the food; 
then, call the waiter again, and pay for the meal. Thus ends day 1.

     ADDITIONAL POINTS

AIRPORT: First, you should examine the car's license plate for 1 point. Then, 
after  getting the print,  you should radio the office for 2 points.  In  the 
bathroom,  you really should dry that gun off.  Try drying it underneath  the 
hand dryer. In addition, go northwest from the ticket agents. There, show the 
mug  shot (and your badge,  if necessary) to the rental agents.  One of  them 
will recognize Bains, and you can ask for a rental list. You can get 4 points 
at the rental agency.  Also,  don't forget to push the traffic button on your 
way back to the car.  Once in your car, make sure you both "RADIO" and "RADIO 
ABOUT RENTAL CAR."

     DAY 2, WAREHOUSE MURDER, AND ENVELOPE

There's been a murder at the Warehouse!  Drive to the warehouse.  The body is 
in the trunk.  Look at body,  then look in hand.  Get the envelope.  You have 
nothing else to do here; so, drive to the address on the envelope.






     MOTEL, SEARCH WARRANT, AND BUSINESS CARD

The  address  turns  out  to be a motel.  Ask the man  in  the  window  which 
apartment you want,  and ask for the key.  He won't give it to you; so, radio 
for a warrant.  Show the man the warrant and get the key.  Stand on the right 
of the door,  draw gun, and open door. BOOM! Good thing you were standing out 
of the line of fire!  Enter the apartment and go into bathroom. You can't see 
the bathroom,  but look around to see what's there. Look in the sink, get the 
business card,  and read it.  Colby?  You remember him: He's the guy who gave 
evidence  against Bains in PQ I.  What's Bains doing with his  card?  Nothing 
left to do here, so go to see Marie. You did promise her you'd visit.

     MARIE'S HOUSE

Drive to Marie's house.  You see a note on the door.  Take it and read it. Go 
inside.  What's happened here? Oh, no! Marie has been kidnapped! Look around. 
Look at table,  look in the ashtray,  take the paper, and read it. Looks like 
Bains' hit list...and you and Marie are next!  Heartbroken,  you head back to 
the station.

     THE STATION, BURGLARY OFFICE, AND STEELTON CALL

At the station,  book the evidence,  but get the number from Colby's business 
card first -- you'll need to call and warn him.  Go into the burglary office, 
and  ask about the gun you discovered.  Go back to your office,  sit down  at 
your desk,  and use the phone to find out the number of Steelton Police. Call 
them and warn them about Bains.  Now call Colby and warn him.  (Doesn't  seem 
too concerned, does he?) Read the envelope in your basket. If you're going to 
chase Bains,  you'd better go and adjust your gun sights again.  (You  should 
know  how to do that by now,  or you'd never have gotten this far!) Get  your 
field kit, and drive to the airport.

     THE AIRPORT, TICKETS, AND METAL DETECTOR

Careful as you cross the street to the airport. Go in and ask for a ticket to 
Steelton. How much? You don't have that much money! Ah, Keith has an idea. He 
calls the Captain and gets the okay to charge the tickets.  (If he doesn't do 
this,  you didn't read the envelope in your basket. Go back and read it.) Get 
the  tickets,  go  to the right,  up the escalator,  and  through  the  metal 
detector. You'd better show your ID to pass through. Next stop: the plane!

     PLANE, HIJACK, AND BOMB

Sit  down  and wear seatbelt.  Drink your drink.  The flight  seems  terribly 
uneventful  until  hijackers suddenly appear!  Remove seat  belt.  While  the 
hijacker is holding the stewardess,  stand and draw gun.  As soon as he drops 
her,  fire! Shoot the other guy as he leaves the cockpit. Check their pockets 
and turbans. Get the instructions and wire cutters. Now to find the bomb.

Go to the bathroom at the back of the plane. Open the dispenser. There it is! 
Read the instructions for making the bomb;  then, do the exact opposite. When 
the instructions say connect,  you cut; when it says disconnect, you connect! 
Well done! Now the the flight will be uneventful!

     ADDITIONAL POINTS

WAREHOUSE:  Before  departing  the  station,  be sure to  grab  all  of  your 
equipment out of your locker.  Also,  make sure you have your field kit. Once 
at the warehouse,  make certain that you take pictures of the trunk, and take 
a blood sample.  After getting the envelope's corner, "MOVE BODY." Then, look 
in the trunk again to find a death threat.  Looks like Bains really wants  to 
get you! These extra things will earn you an additional 6 points.




MOTEL:  To ask the manager which room you want,  show him the mug shot. After 
getting the key,  "RADIO FOR BACKUP," since Bains just might still be in  the 
room. After opening the door, wait a while for the smoke to clear, then enter 
the  room.  In addition to the business card,  you can find some lipstick  by 
"LOOK  UNDER BED." You should thoroughly examine the nightstand for the  rest 
of the envelope.

MARIE'S HOUSE: Make sure you "EXAMINE WRITING" on the note. It's not Marie's, 
and it gets you 3 points.

STATION:  When on the phone with Colby and the Steelton PD, say "HELLO," then 
"TELL MAN ABOUT BAINS." And be sure to check your message basket.

     STEELTON POLICE STATION

After a brief helicopter flight (Lytton station could do with one of  those), 
you find yourself in Steelton Police Station.  Go into the office and talk to 
the Inspector.  It seems as if you are too late:  Colby has been killed.  But 
Bains made a call from Burt Park;  perhaps he's still there!  Get the two-way 
radios from the table and go to the Park.

     BURT PARK, MUGGER, MANHOLE, SEWER, AND GAS MASK

Walk  around the park.  When the mugger runs over to you,  call Keith on  the 
radio.  Got him!  Now go to the right of the pond.  Look at manhole, open it, 
and down you go!

Walk very carefully down here -- don't slip into the sewer!  Cross the  sewer 
and go to the right.  At the end of the tunnel,  go down one screen.  DO  NOT 
STOP or you'll die of gas poisoning. Make a left and avoid the sewer pipes by 
crossing  the tunnel when necessary.  Open the cabinet,  get  the  mask,  and 
continue left.  Whenever you start to feel weak,  wear the gas mask.  Now  go 
down one screen and to the right: a door!

     FIND MARIE, BAINS, AND ENDGAME

Go through the door, and look! There's Marie tied up! Walk toward Marie. When 
she starts to mumble,  tell her to be quiet,  or else Bains will hear her and 
kill you both!  Untie Marie.  What's that?  Footsteps!  Quick!  Run and  hide 
behind that big pipe on the left. Load and draw your gun. As soon as Bains is 
level with you, fire three shots, and he's history!

That's it, the game takes over now! Sit back and enjoy the ending!

     ADDITIONAL POINTS

Problem:
Advice on playing as a Fighter.

Hint:
To  create  a  fighter,  add  more  points  to your Strength and
Vitality, as well as your fighting skills. Read in your Advanced
Adventuring Manual  the section on "Advanced  Fighting" and "The
Land of Shapeir". A fighter needs a daily regimen of exercise to
build up his abilities, so practice frequently with Uhura at the
Guild Hall.  He should learn  about the monsters  inhabiting the
desert  by talking  to Uhura  and Rakeesh.  He should also learn
something about desert  survival by talking to the  guard at the
city gate. The fighter should seek out monsters in the desert to
hone  his  fighting  skills,  once  he  is properly prepared for
desert travel.  Equipping with the  finest available sword  will
increase his  chances at survival, and  wagering with Issur will
help increase his strength.

Problem:
Advice on playing as a Magic User.

Hint:
To create a Magic User, add more points to your Intelligence and
Agility,  as  well  as  your  Magic  skill.  Read in your Famous
Adventurer's  Correspondence   School  Manual  the   section  on
"Advanced Magic Using", "Basic  Spell Usage" and "Advanced Spell
Usage". Visit the Magic Shop  to gain new spells and information
about  magic. Talk  to the  Enchantress to  learn more about the
magic  of this  land. Become  a Wizard  by finding the "Wizard's
Institute of Technocery" and passing the entrance exams.


Problem:
Hints on becoming a Wizard.

Hint:
To become a Wizard, you  must first find the "Wizard's Institute
of Technocery". This is carefully concealed so only a Magic User
can find it. Use your spells in the streets of Shapeir to locate
and  enter the  "Wizard's  Institute  of Technocery".  You might
detect something worthwhile. Take the  tests, but don't worry if
you don't succeed  at first. The practice in  spell casting will
help increase you skills.

Problem:
Advice on playing as a Thief.

Hint:
To create  a Thief, add  more points to  your Agility, Vitality,
and Luck,  as well as to  your Stealth and Lock  Picking skills.
Read  the  section  upon  Advanced  Thieving  Techniques in your
Famous Adventurer's  Correspondence School Manual  and make sure
you  are equipped with the  latest in  thieving technology. Make
contact  with  your  local  Thief  representative  by making the
"Sign",  and  learn  the  best  places  to  use  your particular
talents.  Practice  your  skills  wherever  possible,  and never
resist a good challenge.

Problem:
Hints on becoming a Journeyman Thief.

Hint:
To become  a Journeyman Thief,  you need first  to practice your
skills in Shapeir.  Once you are in Raseir,  you need to contact
the head of the Thieves' Guild.  He will ask you to "recover" an
object  for  him  through  the  use  of  your  skills.  Once you
accomplish this mission, you will  earn the respect and title of
"Journeyman".

Problem:
Hints on becoming a Paladin.

Hint:
To  become  a  Paladin,  you  must  concentrate  on doing things
honorably. Read  the section on Paladins  under "Combat Careers"
in  your Famous  Adventurer's Correspondence  School Manual, but
remember, it  is a bit  biased. Talk to  Rakeesh and Omar  about
Paladins  and Heroes.  Do good  deeds wherever  and whenever you
can,  and never  attack an  unarmed opponent.  Always choose the
most honorable way to do something.

Problem:
How do I Import a character?

Hint:
First play  Quest For Glory I  to the conclusion and  follow the
directions to  create a character disk  for transfer. Then, when
you  start "Quest  for Glory  II -  Trial by  Fire", select  the
"Import a Hero" and follow the directions given.

Problem:
A little background on your character before this game.

Hint:
In "Quest for  Glory I - So You  Want to Be a Hero",  you were a
beginning   adventurer  fresh   from  the   Famous  Adventurer's
Correspondence  School  for  Heroes."  You  visited  the land of
Spielburg,  drawn by  a notice   that the  town was  besieged by
brigands. You  helped rescue the  son and daughter  of the Baron
Stefan  von Spielburg,  and drove  Baba Yaga  from the land. You
also made  many friends, including Shameen,  Shema, Abdulla, and
the eccentric Wizard Erasmus with  his magical rat,  Fenrus. For
more information,  talk to Abdulla and  Shameen. Better yet, buy
the game and play it - you'll like it!

Problem:
The plot of Trial By Fire.

Hint:
Read the section on the  "Special Southern Supplement - The Land
of Shapeir"  in your "Famous  Adventurer's Correspondence School
Manual". Talk to Rakeesh and listen to Omar's poetry readings at
the Katta's  Tail Inn on  the evening of  day three. Someone  is
behind the Emir's disappearance in Raseir, and is trying to take
over all  of Shapeir as  well. Only a  skilled and cunning  Hero
like  yourself  can  overcome  his  deadly  magic  and solve the
mystery of who is behind these actions.

Problem:
How do I exchange my "old" money?

Hint:
Ask about the Money Changer. Harik Attar, Abdulla, and the Katta
merchants all can  help you. Use the map  supplied with the game
to figure  out where in  the city she  should be, following  the
directions you have been  given. Alichica's directions will also
get you  to the Money Changer's,  but it is very  hard to follow
them.

Problem:
What should I do when I locate the Money Changer?

Hint:
The Money Changer will be  overjoyed to exchange some money with
you (for a  slight commission, of course). You  can get a better
deal exchanging a little money at  a time. Ask her about Raseir,
money, and Sultan. She is  an excellent source of information if
you are  a thief and  approach her correctly.  After you've done
her a  favor, show her your  stuff and bargain about  it. You'll
get a  better deal. She'll  also tell you  another place to  use
your skills.

Problem:
Help! I keep getting lost in Shapeir!

Hint:
Whenever you  come to a  passageway in the  alleys, type "Look".
This  will give  you the  names  of  the streets  you have  come
across. Locate the streets on the  map supplied with the game to
navigate around  the city. As soon  as you have some  Dinars and
Centimes, buy  a map from  Alichica and use  it to help  you get
around.

Problem:
I need some tips on what to do in Shapier.

Hint:
Abdulla  is a  wealth of  gossip when  he is  around, so ask him
questions about what he is  saying. Talking to everyone you meet
and asking questions  will give you a feel for  what is going on
in Shapeir.  You can always go  mongering for rumors. Go  to the
Guild Hall and  read the "Quest Board" for things  to do. If you
really want some adventure, go out  in the desert and fight some
monsters.  That should  keep you  busy. Just  don't stay out too
long, or you might not survive.

Problem:
What should I do in the bazaars?

Hint:
The Katta  merchants in the  bazaars will be  happy to sell  you
things,  some  of  which  are  crucial  to  your  survival.  Try
bargaining  with them  if you  are running  short of money. They
will also occasionally keep you  informed about what is going on
in the  plazas. Everyone knows  one another in  the bazaars, and
they are certainly keeping track of your actions.

Problem:
All the plazas are empty of merchants! What happened?

Hint:
If you enter a plaza and the merchants are gone and the scene is
dark, then press the "control key" and the letter "D". This will
give you  the time of day.  The merchants of the  bazaar fold up
their stands  at night. If it  is daytime and the  merchants are
not present, perhaps there is a good reason for this. See if any
Elementals are around.

Problem:
I found something lying around in the fountain plaza. What should
I do with it?

Hint:
Look at the object  when you pick it up. There is  a clue to its
owner inside. You can keep it,  take the money, or try to return
it to the owner. This is entirely up to you and your character.

Problem:
What should I do at the Katta's Tail Inn?

Hint:
The Katta's Tail  Inn is a place to stay  the night and get free
meals, as  well as a great  source of information. Abdulla  is a
good source  of gossip when he  is around, so ask  him about the
Sultan, the Astrologer, the News, the Emir, and Raseir. Shema is
the motherly  type who tries to  make sure you get  a good meal.
Sit  down in  the morning  and evening  to order  some wonderful
meals. For entertainment,  watch her dance on the  nights of her
performance.  For  information,  ask  her  about Raseir, rumors,
Sharaf,  and the  Underground.  Shameen  will keep  you informed
about what  goes on at the  Inn and events in  the city. Ask him
about Raseir, the  Sultan, and guest. When Omar  performs, it is
best  to sit  down and  listen. Ask  him about  Dervish, Raseir,
Paladin, and Enchantress.  It is very rewarding to  make a point
of showing  up on the  evenings he is  to perform. Shameen  will
remind you of the days he shows up.

Problem:
The Apothecary.

Hint:
The  Apothecary is  the source   of pills  which will  help your
survival. Harik  Attar is a man  obsessed with fire, and  a good
source  for information  on the  subject. Ask  him about  Pills,
Dispel Potions, Components, Raseir, Fruit of Compassion, and the
Fire Elemental.

Problem:
The Magic Shop.

Hint:
The Magic Shop is the place  for Magic Items and information. If
you are a  Magic User, you can get spells  here. If you practice
the  arts of  thieving, a  crucial magic  item can be purchased,
providing you  have obtained enough money.  Keapon Laffin may be
an airhead and overly fond of dropping names, but he does know a
lot about magic and the  magical things going on around Shapeir.
Drop in to his store whenever you have a question. Ask him about
magic, the  enchantress, the dervish, spells,  the Air Elemental
and anything else that has to do with magic.

Problem:
The Weapons Shop.

Hint:
The Weapon  Shop of Issur is  the source for daggers  and a good
Sword.  It also  has an  object which  will be  critical for the
defeat of an elemental, but it  isn't for sale. Issur is a bully
and a braggart,  but he is strong. Ask  him about Arm Wrestling,
and use him to help build up  your strength. If you are a thief,
this place can be profitable, but you need more information from
the Money Changer first.

Problem:
The Guild Hall.

Hint:
Read  about   the  Guild  Hall   in  your  Famous   Adventurer's
Correspondence  School   Manual.  Study  the   Quest  Board  for
information on things that need to  be done and how to make some
money in  the city. Make the  Guild Hall a regular  stop in your
adventuring  activities.  You  never  know  just  what  might be
waiting  for  you  there.  Uhura  knows  a  lot  about fighting.
Practice  martial  arts  with  her  to  increase your skills and
chance  at  survival  in  the  desert.  Ask  her about monsters,
Rakeesh,  Raseir, and  the  Sultan.  Rakeesh is  sometimes found
around  the Guild  Hall. He   works with  the Sultan,  and helps
reward the virtuous. Ask him about Paladins, his leg, the demon,
his kingdom,  monsters, and power. He  can be a big  help to the
fighter against an Earth Elemental.

Problem:
The Palace of Shapeir -

Hint:
The only  way to get  into the Palace  of Shapeir is  to win the
game. The Hero Awards Ceremony is held there.

Problem:
The Enchantress Aziza.

Hint:
The Enchantress Aziza  knows much about the Magic  of this land,
especially Water-related  Magic and Elemental lore,  and is more
than willing to share this  with you, providing you approach her
politely. Her house is located off  the east end of Shmali Tarik
on the  side street called "Sitt  Tarik". To visit her,  do what
one normally does when approaching  a stranger's door and answer
her questions  truthfully. If you  don't know who  sent you, you
can always reply, "Keapon Laffin",  if you remember what element
the shopkeeper  of the Magic Shop  has between his ears.  As for
the riddle she poses, think in terms of the alphabet. Aziza will
give you crucial information about  Magic, the Djinn, Iblis, the
various  Elementals,  contrary  elements,  containers,  and  the
Plant. Make a point of visiting her on day 16 as she requests.

Problem:
The Astrologer.

Hint:
The Astrologer lives at the south  end of Tarik of Stars. He can
give  you  information  about  astrology  and  the  omens of the
future,  as  long  as  you  are  honest  with  him. He will even
foretell  your future,  if you   are willing  to tell  him about
yourself and return another day. If you want to be kind, ask him
about money and follow up on what he says.

Problem:
The Wizard's Institute of Technocery.

Hint:
The  Wizard's Institute  of Technocrey  is hidden  so that  only
Magic Users can  find it. Use one of your  spells in the streets
of  Shapeir to  find the  way there.  You will  need someone  to
sponsor  you at  this prestigious  school, so  pick the Archmage
from Spielburg  (see "The Story  Thus Far..." in  your Technical
Manual). His  pre-test is pretty  simple, use the  Detect Magic,
Fetch, and Trigger  spells. Don't worry if you  don't succeed at
first -  you are getting  valuable practice, and  you can always
try again later. To pass the Wizard's test, you will need almost
all the available spells purchase what  you do not have from the
Magic Shop. Stock up on Mana pills from the Apothecary. Try your
spells  against  the  challenges  knowing  that  you are gaining
experience as you use them.

Problem:
How to pass the Wizard's Test.

Hint:
The trick to the Air challenge is to stay above the problem once
it comes to  you. With the Earth challenge  it helps to remember
that  what  can  be  done  can  sometimes  be  undone. The Water
challenge tries to  teach you to only use a  spell as long as it
is  effective, and  by targeting  your efforts  where they  will
provide  the most  leverage. The  Fire challenge  is an open and
shut puzzle. Air challenge - Fetch and Levitate. Earth challenge
-  Trigger and  2 Calms.  Water or  Ice challenge  - Flame Dart,
Force Bolt,  and Open. Fire  challenge - Open,  Calm, Fetch, and
Force  Bolt.  Don't  take  the  easy  way  out  once  you are an
initiate!

Problem:
The Eternal Order of Fighters.

Hint:
The Order  will call on you  once you have proven  yourself as a
Fighter. You will  need high fighting skills to  become a member
so make  sure you practice daily.  Check the Guild Hall  on days
13, 14, and 15 for more  information. After sunset on day 15, go
to the east  end of Askeri Darb. You'll have  to trust them, and
prove yourself in battle. Use your dodging skills to obtain your
weapon  and shield.  It will  be your  skills against their best
warrior.

Problem:
The Break-in House (if you are a thief).

Hint:
First contact the Money Changer  and follow her directions about
when and  where to go.  Be fully equipped  as the Money  Changer
suggests. When you find the right  place at the right time, SAVE
your game.  Remember to use  all your thieving  skills here, and
search  the  room  carefully.  Don't  forget  to  look under the
carpet. Be as quiet as you can,  and when in doubt, hide. If you
don't want to  get caught, make sure you  put the obvious things
back the way you found them.

Problem:
Care and feeding of your Saurus.

Hint:
You must buy a Saurus if you want to win the game. You will have
to deal  with Ali Fakir  on day 2  or so. Hold  out for the best
deal. 5 dinar is the least  he will settle for. DON'T refuse the
final offer. Once  you own a saurus, type RIDE  to get it out of
the pen. You may also MOUNT  and DISMOUNT. The saurus, at first,
may seem to be a bad bargain, but this is a very special saurus.
If you are  lost in the desert, tell  it to go home and  it will
take  you directly  to the  stable. It  will also  allow you  to
travel faster and use less water. If the Saurus runs away from a
monster, just defeat  the monster, wander out of  the room, then
come back  and your Saurus  will be waiting.  It really is  very
loyal. If  you still can't find  him, head back to  town on your
own.  Your  Saurus  will  eventually  make  its  way back to the
stable. The guard at the gate will take care of your saurus once
you dismount.

Problem:
Elemental information.

Hint:
Read  the  Section  in  your  Famous Adventurer's Correspondence
School  Manual on  Elementals (page  20). Fortunately,  you will
never meet  the most powerful  Elemental mentioned, so  don't be
concerned about  the anchovies. Talk to  Aziza and Keapon Laffin
to get some basic information. There are two parts to the defeat
of  an Elemental:  Contrary Elements  and Containers.  There are
also  people  in  Shapeir  who  have  an  affinity  for  certain
elements. Those are  the ones to ask questions  about a specific
Elemental.

Problem:
Defeating the Fire Elemental.

Hint:
First  talk  to  Aziza   about  Elementals,  contrary  elements,
containers, and  the Fire Elemental.  Then talk to  Harik at the
Apothecary about the Fire Elemental  and Flame. You will need to
buy incense  from him in order  to lure the Elemental  away from
the  plaza before  you can  capture it.  Don't buy  more than  1
packet of incense. You will also need water from the fountain as
the Contrary Element  and a proper container for  fire (a lamp).
You  will need  to lure  the Fire  Elemental, put  the lamp down
before you weaken  it with its contrary Element,  and capture it
in the container.

Problem:
Defeating the Air Elemental.

Hint:
First  talk  to  Aziza   about  Elementals,  contrary  elements,
containers, and  the Air Elemental. Then  talk to Keapon Laffin.
He  will give  you a  very subtle  clue about  what is  a proper
container for air  (a bellows). It hangs above  the Weapon Shop.
If you tell Issur about the Air Elemental, you can try to win it
at  arm wrestling  if you  are a  very strong  fighter-type. The
thief will probably need to steal it at night, but will need the
magic rope. The  Magic User has a couple of  ways to get it. The
easiest is  to use a  spell at night.  You can get  the Contrary
Element (dirt) in  the Fountain Plaza from someone  who uses it,
or from Keapon if you ask  about it. To use the Contrary Element
against the Air Elemental, the fighter needs to use Strength and
then drop the  contrary element. The Thief can  use his throwing
skill to  get it into the  funnel. The Magic User  needs to rise
above the Elemental and drop the Contrary Element. Then you just
capture Air Elemental in the container.

Problem:
Defeating the Earth Elemental.

Hint:
First  talk  to  Aziza   about  Elementals,  contrary  elements,
containers, and the Earth Elemental.  You will need to wear down
the Earth Elemental with the  Contrary Element (fire) before you
can  capture it.  Go talk   to Rakeesh,  the liontaur,  for some
ideas. If you are a Fighter,  Rakeesh will be more than happy to
loan  you what  you need.  A thief  should talk  to Harik at the
Apothecary about the Earth Elemental and Earth. You will have to
bargain carefully for  what you need. The Magic  User is able to
use one of  his spells against the Earth  Elemental, but it will
take a  lot of spells to  weaken it. The container  (cloth sack)
can be purchased from a merchant in the Fighter's Plaza.

Problem:
Defeating the Water Elemental.

Hint:
Ask  Aziza about  the  Water  Elemental, Contrary  Elements, and
Containers. You  already have a source  for the Contrary Element
(the bellows  with air), as  well as a  container for the  Water
Elemental (a waterskin).  Just don't get too close  to the Water
Elemental unless you have these ready.

Problem:
Exploring the Desert.

Hint:
Read the desert survival section  (page 14) in your Manual. Talk
to the gate guard about preparations.  It is also a wise idea to
buy a compass from Alichica  to keep from getting turned around.
Healing pills and Vigor pills  from the Apothecary will help you
survive monster encounters. If you do get lost and you have your
saurus, just say  "go home" and the saurus  will take you there.
If  you are  lost without  a saurus,  remember the mountains are
both north and south of the  city of Shapeir, but the city rests
in the northern mountains. To  learn more about combat, read the
combat section in your Technical  Manual (page 9). Talk to Uhura
and Rakeesh  about monsters. Practice your  fighting skills with
Uhura  and she  will give  you valuable  tips on  combatting the
various monsters.  Some monsters may  be too tough  for you when
you are starting out, so don't forget to run away if your health
points get low.

Problem:
Dealing with the Dervish.

Hint:
The Dervish is  five screens south of Shapeir  and three screens
to the east  in the Oasis. He is happy  to talk to you, although
he doesn't seem  to say much. On day twelve,  he will try to get
you to  visit him. Seems he  has a puzzle for  you to solve. Ask
him for  details about what  he says. You  will find the  puzzle
five screens west of the city of Shapeir and three screens down.
You can  also rest or  sleep at the  Oasis, but don't  stay away
from town too long!

Problem:
The Griffin.

Hint:
The  Griffin nests  along the  cliff sides  west of  town. It is
usually  best  to  let  sleeping  Griffins  lie.  You may need a
feather,  though.  If  you  are  a  Fighter  and do some careful
searching,  you may  uncover one.  The Thief  will need  to do a
fancy  rope trick  to get  a feather.  The Magic  User should do
something similar to the Thief, but with magic.

Problem:
The Plant Woman.

Hint:
The Plant Woman can be found along the mountains several screens
to  the east  of the  City of  Shapeir. Talk  to the Enchantress
about the Plant Woman, and Aziza  will tell you a sad story. She
will  also tell  you how   to help.  Follow her  instructions in
order, pull some  magic out of your sack, say  her name, and the
Plant Woman will give you a  gift. Julanar may not yet be human,
but your part in her story  ends here. Once the tree blooms, she
will provide some shade for resting.

Problem:
The Caged Beast.

Hint:
The Dervish asks some important  questions about the Caged Beast
to which  you must learn the  answers. Don't show too  much pity
for  this monster,  but remember  nothing survives  long in this
desert  without supplies.  Talk to  the Apothecary  about Dispel
Potions and Fruit  of Compassion. Talk to Aziza  about the Plant
Woman. After  you have the Fruit  and the Feather, give  them to
Harik  to make  you a  potion. You  will need  to add  the final
ingredient  when you  get back  to the  Beast. Distract it first
before you try to get that  its fur. Then give the Dispel Potion
to the Beast, and see what happens.

Problem:
Fighting Jackalmen and Brigands.

Hint:
To  learn more  about combat,  read the  combat section  in your
Technical  Manual  (page  9).  Talk  to  Uhura and Rakeesh about
monsters. Practice your fighting skills  with Uhura and she will
give  you  valuable  tips  on  combatting  the various monsters.
Remember to search the body of the brigand after you defeat him.
The  Jackalmen  will  try  to  overwhelm  you  by sheer numbers.
Whenever you are low in Health Points, run away.

Problem:
Fighting scorpions.

Hint:
Before  you fight  a Scorpion,  talk to  Harik at the Apothecary
about pills. He has some  you'll need. Practice your dodging and
blocking skills with Uhura. You  don't want that Scorpion's tail
to  hit you.  Make sure  you take  a pill  before combat just in
case.  If in  doubt whether  you can  win, run  away. If  you do
defeat it, get the tail.

Problem:
Fighting Ghouls.

Hint:
The Ghouls only  come out at night. Ask  Uhura and Rakeesh about
them.  Unlike most  monsters, they  don't really  hurt you, they
just  sap your  will to  live. If  your Stamina  gets low  while
fighting  them -  run away.  Once  a  Ghoul drains  all of  your
Stamina, you  are finished. When  you have destroyed  the Ghoul,
don't forget to collect its claws.

Problem:
Fighting Terrorsauruses (or is that sauri?).

Hint:
The  Terrorsaurus is  the toughest  monster in  the desert. Make
sure you build up your combat skills before you try to face him.
Run away if you have to, but remember, the Terrorsaurus is fast.
You might not escape. Take some Healing and Stamina Pills if you
get a chance.

Problem:
How do I get to Raseir?

Hint:
The only  way to get  to Raseir is  by caravan, and  the caravan
leaves Shapeir on day 17. Just  get a good rest the night before
at  the Katta's  Tail Inn,  and  you'll  be on  your way  in the
morning. One  special note: if  you are a  thief, make sure  you
have a supply of oil before you leave!

Problem:
How do I obtain reservations at the Blue Parrot Inn?

Hint:
Senor Ferrari at the Blue Parrot Inn is a very important man, so
it is  important to follow  his "suggestions". This  will be the
place you spend  the night, assuming you stay  on Ferrari's good
side. He  is a most  influential man, and  can introduce you  to
someone who  knows things about  you. Ask him  about Raseir, the
Inn, the Emir, and rumors. Your room is past the wall behind the
bar, but you can only use  it at night. Don't worry about paying
for  your room  there. You  will discover  that you have already
paid more than enough.

Problem:
What should I do when introduced to Ugarte?

Hint:
When you have  been introduced to Ugarte, it is  best to pay him
for  information.   Ask  him  about   service,  water,  someone,
expected, lackeys, fountain, and prophecy.

Problem:
What should I do on my second day in Raseir?

Hint:
The  natives  are   going  out  of  their  way   to  stage  some
entertainment for you, so be sure  to visit the far southern end
of the  Fountain Plaza in Raseir.  If you head back  towards the
Blue Parrot Inn afterwards, you will meet a mysterious stranger.
Follow her  and then follow the  instructions given there. After
that, you can explore the town  some more, but keep track of the
time of day. You'd better not be out after dark.

Problem:
How do I handle a Harem Girl?

Hint:
Give the Harem Girl what she wants, but first ask about Khaveen,
marry,  father, disguise,  Ad Avis,  Power, control,  Harem, and
magic.

Problem:
A Thief's Guide to Raseir.

Hint:
Make the thief sign at the Blue Parrot Inn when talking to Senor
Ferrari. He  will give you  information about a  little favor he
wants you to do. Follow his instructions. You will need all your
thief skills and equipment to handle this case. Use your stealth
to travel at night, and your rope to get into the house. Be very
patient, take your time. Don't make any more noise than you have
to. If  you do make  noise, stop and  wait a few  moments before
moving  again. Before  you can  actually get  the Bird, you will
need to handle  the hinges and the lock.  Then quietly sneak out
the way you came in.

Problem:
What should I do in the Dungeons of the Emir's Palace?

Hint:
There are three  things you must do to  escape the dungeon. Open
the gate  to the cell, get  your equipment, and find  the secret
passage  out. If  you are  a Magic  User or  a Fighter, use your
natural skills to escape. If you  are a thief, your equipment is
missing. You will have to make  do with what you can find. Check
your  inventory or  the hay  near the  Katta prisoner.  Get your
stuff and search the room. Use  your strength or a spell to open
the secret passage. Then escape.

Problem:
What do I do my friend, Ad Avis?

Hint:
Ad Avis  is a wonderful person,  or so he says.  Just do what he
wants, and  you will get  along fine with  him, if you  survive.
After all, you don't really have a choice!

Hint:
When Ad Avis tells you to  open the door, use what Zayishah gave
you (check your inventory).

Problem:
I can't see in here!

Hint:
Rub the magic item you made  earlier to see your way around. You
will need  to do something in  the Water Room next  door to stop
the wind in this room.

Problem:
How can I make it over the river?

Hint:
Set the  Arcade Difficulty Level  in your Game  menu to a  level
appropriate  to your  own skill.  Save your  game. To  cross the
water, try  it near the  waterfall. Jump on  at the right  time,
then jump off  when you get near land. Restore  your game if you
make  a mistake.  Both the  Fighter and  the Magic  User need to
apply Force  here to stop  the wind in  the Air Room.  The Thief
needs  to use  his powers   of observation  and his  Thief tools
("rock  picks"?).  Then  climb  the  rocks  to  the  left of the
waterfall and cross back through the  Air Room and into the Fire
Room.

Use water on yourself, time the fire geysers carefully, and move
quickly but cautiously through this room.

Problem:
I'm in the room with the door, what should I do?

Hint:
When you  enter here, it  might be wise  to take a  Healing Pill
after the Fire  Room. A Thief uses his rope  to get down off the
ledge, a Magic  User uses an up and down  sort of spell, and the
Fighter just has to be Macho. To open the door, you will need to
say the  name of the  one who bound  Iblis (Suleiman). Read  the
Land of  Shapeir Background and  History Section in  your Famous
Adventurer's Correspondence School Manual.

Problem:
How can I get the Treasure?

Hint:
The entire  Treasure room is a  trap, so save as  you come in if
you want to check out ways to die. Otherwise, ignore the obvious
and pass through safely.
Please enter selection: n

Problem:
What should I do when I find the Statue of Iblis?

Hint:
As you head upward towards the glowing statue of Iblis, you will
find yourself trapped by Ad Avis. After he leaves, use your lamp
to see the way around, and you  will find a very magical ring to
help you escape.

Problem:
How do I handle the Genie of the Ring?

Hint:
Ask the  Djinni about wishes,  master, prophecy, ring,  prowess,
health, and teleport.  Wish for the things he  can give you, but
don't waste all  of the wishes. Use the final  wish to "wish for
transport", so you can escape the Forbidden City.

Problem:
How can I enter the Palace of the Emir of Raseir as a fighter?

Hint:
The fighter has no option but  to fight the guards and force the
door to  get into the castle.  Do it quickly before  more guards
arrive.

Problem:
How can I enter the Palace of the Emir of Raseir as a thief?

Hint:
The Thief  needs to sneak in  the shadows up to  the Palace wall
and uses  his rope to go  off left when the  Eunuch guard is not
watching.

Problem:
How can I enter the Palace of the Emir of Raseir as a Magic User?

Hint:
The Magic User must cast "Dazzle" at the guards, and then "Open"
at the Palace gates, to enter.

Problem:
I am a Fighter. How can I get past Khaveen?
Hint:
Jump down from the Balcony and challenge Khaveen to a duel after
the guard  has gone. Never  give up, but  you will need  to be a
very skilled  Fighter to defeat  Khaveen. Get your  weapon while
you can.  Take a Healing Pill  after the battle if  you can, and
head  for the  door to  the Ritual  Chamber. You  will take some
damage opening the door.

Problem:
I am a Thief. How can I get past the Eunuch Guards?

Hint:
Timing  is essential  in this  room. First  hide behind the Fish
fountain, and let the Harem  Girl distract the one Eunuch Guard.
Keep an eye on the roving guard,  and be ready to move before he
can see you.  Hide behind the table next  until the roving guard
is  out of  the room,  then  quickly  sneak across  to the  door
outside.

Problem:
I am a Magic User. How can I get past Khaveen?

Hint:
The Magic User should use the  Calm spell upon Khaveen after the
guard is gone. You can then use a spell to get down, use a spell
to prepare yourself for Ad Avis, use a spell to open the door to
the Ritual Chamber and then go in.

Problem:
How do I defeat Ad Avis as a Fighter?

Hint:
You have  no time to waste  in this room. Avoid  combat with the
living statue, kick over a candle, then move to the left side of
the  screen. Run  towards Ad  Avis before  he can  cast too many
spells. Don't let a little fire stop you from getting him.

Problem:
I am a Thief and I can't reach Ad Avis!

Hint:
You will need to  use your rope to get to Ad  Avis, and all your
balancing skills. Once on the other side, throw something at one
of the candles to stop the ritual. Carefully avoid the Spells Ad
Avis  is throwing  at you.  Move to  the right  pillar to  get a
direct line  of sight at Ad  Avis, and keep throwing  daggers at
him.

Problem:
How do I defeat Ad Avis as a Magic User?

Hint:
You have no time to waste here.  Cast a spell to stop the living
statue (remember  the WIT "Earth"  test?), make sure  you have a
protection spell  going, and cast  a spell at  one of the  unlit
candles to keep  Ad Avis from lighting it. Now  you have made Ad
Avis really mad. If you are  protected, Ad Avis will not be able
to cast a  spell directly at you, but  unfortunately, he has the
same Protection. You will need  to use an indirect spell against
him before he figures out how to  get you. Move a bit left, cast
a spell  to bounce off  the wall and  knock the brazier  into Ad
Avis to defeat him.

HOW TO SOLVE ... -=> QUESTRON <=- ...

BY : COPY/CAT - */HI-RES<>HIJACKERS/*

THANX : SORCEROR, CRACKER JACK, NINJA

QUESTRON IS ESSENTIALLY ULTIMA 1.5 OR
SO.  IT IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN ULTIMA
I, AND HAS NICER GRAPHICS.  IT IS NOT
NEAR THE MACHINE LANGUAGE SPEED OF
EITHER OF THE TWO LATTER ULTIMAS.  IT
IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ALL THREE.  THE
OBJECT OF QUESTRON IS TO KILL MANTOR,
THE EVIL WIZARD.  YOU ARE AIDED BY
MESRON, THE GOOD WIZARD.  THERE ARE NO
LEVELS IN QUESTRON.  YOU MOVE UP BY
RANKS, FROM SERF THROUGH KNIGHT.  HERE
IS HOW TO WIN QUESTRON STEP-BY-STEP:

1] BEFORE EVEN MAKING A CHARACTER, GET
   A MAP OF BOTH CONTINENTS.  TO DO
   THIS, YOU MUST BREAK INTO R-DOS AND
   LOAD IN THE PICTURES.  THE EASIEST
   WAY TO DO THIS IS WITH "RINGSIDE
   SEAT", WHICH HAS R-DOS ON IT, AND
   ALLOWS YOU TO CTRL-C OUT OF IT.
   JUST BOOT IT UP, AND AFTER THE DOS
   LOADS IN, HIT CTRL-C.  THEN INSERT
   QUESTRON DISK 1 AND TYPE '&CAT',
   WHICH DOES AN R-DOS DIRECTORY.
   THEN TYPE '&RECALL "CONT ONE-PIC",
   16384.  THIS LOADS IN THE FIRST PIC
   ONTO HI-RES PAGE 2.  THEN BOOT ANY
   SLAVE DISK, AND TYPE 'BSAVE QPIC1,
   A$4000,L$1FF8'.  THEN DUMP IT ON
   YOUR PRINTER.  DO THE SAME WITH THE
   SECOND PICTURE, ALTHOUGH YOU WON'T
   NEED IT FOR A WHILE.

2] NOW YOU JUST NEED TO GET TO THE
   RANK OF KNIGHT.  YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
   AROUND BLOWING EVERYTHING AWAY AS
   FAST AS POSSIBLE.  GO TO A TOWN AND
   BUY THE BEST ARMOR AND WEAPONS YOU
   CAN AFFORD.  THEN FIGHT YOUR WAY TO
   OTHER TOWNS, UPGRADING YOUR WEAPONS
   AND ARMOR AS YOU GO.  BE SURE TO
   GET FOOD EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.  TO
   ADD A LITTLE SPICE TO THE GAME, GO
   TO THE SWAMP AND OCEAN CATHEDRALS.
   AT THE SWAMP ONE, YOU CAN PLAY A
   GAME OF SKEET AND GAIN DEXTERITY.
   AT THE OCEAN POINT ONE YOU CAN GET
   A MAGIC FLUTE WHICH WILL GRANT YOU
   CERTAIN WISHES.  ANOTHER FUN THING
   TO DO IS TO GAMBLE.  THE BEST PLACE
   TO GAMBLE IS NOT "GAMBLERS GROTTO".
   AT THE SMALLER TOWNS, YOU CAN WIN
   BIG WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL A TON OF
   GUARDS ON THE WAY OUT.  ANYWAYS,
   EVERY TIME THE GAME SAYS "MESRON
   WANTS TO SEE YOU", THAT MEANS THAT
   YOU HAVE GAINED A RANK.  MESRON IS
   IN THE CASTLE, WHICH IS ON A SMALL
   MOUNTAIN-SURROUNDED PENINSULA NEAR
   THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONTINENT.
   ENTER IT, AND GO EAST UNTIL YOU GET
   TO A LARGE CORRIDOR.  SOON YOU WILL
   FIND A ONE-BLOCK CORRIDOR LEADING
   TO THE NORTH.  THIS GOES TO MESRON.
   (S)PEAK TO HIM, AND HE WILL RAISE
   YOUR RANK.  AFTER A FEW PROMOTIONS,
   HE WILL TELL YOU TO BECOME THE BEST
   WARRIOR IN THE LAND.  TO DO THIS,
   YOU MUST STEAL THE SILVER TRUMPET
   FROM THIS CASTLE.  TO DO THAT, YOU
   MUST GET ALL THE KEYS.  YOU WILL
   SEE NUMEROUS WHITE AND BLUE THINGS,
   WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CHESTS.
   BEFORE OPENING ONE, BE SURE THAT
   YOU HAVE SOME MAGIC POWDER, WHICH
   MESRON SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU.  BY
   SPRINKLING SOME, YOU WILL SLOW DOWN
   THE GUARDS, ALLOWING YOU TO OPEN
   ALL THE CHESTS MORE EASILY.  MAKE
   SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF HIT POINTS,
   THOUGH.  TO GET MORE HIT POINTS YOU
   MUST MAKE DONATIONS TO CATHEDRALS.
   THEN GO TO THE CROSS AND CLAIM YOUR
   VIALS.  DRINK THEM FOR MORE POINTS.
   WHEN RAIDING THE CASTLE, BE SURE TO
   OPEN ALL CHESTS, ESPECIALLY THE
   ONES THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY FANCY
   ORNAMENTS ETC.  THEY USUALLY HOLD A
   KEY OR THE SILVER TRUMPET INSIDE.
   ALSO, TRY EXPLORING THE REST OF
   THE CASTLE BY USING THE KEYS.  YOU
   WILL FIND A PRINCESS WHO ADDS TO
   YOUR CHARISMA AND SOME OTHER GUY
   WHO ADDS TO YOUR STRENGTH.  ONCE
   YOU HAVE STOLEN THE TRUMPET,
   RETURN TO MESRON AND HE WILL KNIGHT
   YOU.  NOW YOU ARE READY FOR THE BIG
   PART OF THE GAME.

3] HEAD TO THE TOP OF THE CONTINENT,
   WHERE THE FOG IS.  HOLD THE TRUMPET
   AND (O)PERATE IT WHENEVER YOU ARE
   ON FOG.  THEN CONTINUE ONWARD UNTIL
   YOU GET TO THE HIDDEN PORT.  ENTER
   AND BUY A CLIPPER (2000+ GOLD).
   NOW YOU ARE READY TO SET SAIL FOR
   THE OTHER, EVIL CONTINENT.  JUST
   KEEP SAILING IN ONE DIRECTION UNTIL
   IT ASKS YOU TO SWITCH DISKS.

4] THE EVIL CONTINENT IS FULL OF NASTY
   MONSTERS WHO DO MUCH MORE DAMAGE
   THAN THOSE ON CONTINENT ONE.  YOU
   CANNOT GET HIT POINT VIALS, BECAUSE
   THERE ARE NO CATHEDRALS.  TO GET
   MORE HIT POINTS, ENTER ONE OF THE
   SIX TOWNS AND (S)PEAK TO THE MAGIC
   SHOP OWNER.  NUMBER 6 WILL GET YOU
   HIT POINTS.  BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE
   ALMOST 20,000 HIT POINTS.  IF NOT,
   GET MORE GOLD AND BUY THEM.  THEN
   GET ABOUT 10,000 GOLD TO BUY SOME
   SPELLS.  TO BE PREPARED FOR THE
   DUNGEONS, YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED
   FOR THE WORST.  BUY AT LEAST THREE
   CUTLASSES, A ROPE AND SPIKES, 50
   MAGIC MISSILES, 50 FIREBALLS, 10
   STONE SPELLS, 10 ARMOR ENHANCEMENT
   SPELLS, AND 5 PASS WALLS.  ALSO, BE
   READY TO CHEAT.  USE AN OLD MONITOR
   OR RAMCARD EMULATOR (AS DESCRIBED
   IN MY BASICS OF BASIC CRACKING I).
   PLAY NORMALLY, BUT WHEN YOU GET TOO
   LOW ON HIT POINTS, BREAK INTO THE
   MONITOR, HIT "D6:00", CTRL-C <CR>,
   "HP=20000", "HGR", AND "GOTO 10".
   OBVIOUSLY, YOU COULD CHEAT A LOT
   MORE, BUT THAT'S FOR YOU TO FIGURE
   OUT.  ENTER "MOUNTAIN CATACOMBS"
   (CENTER OF CONTINENT), AND FIGHT
   YOUR WAY DOWN TO THE (HOLY SHIT!)
   EIGHTH LEVEL.  THERE YOU WILL FIND
   ONLY ONE WAY TO GO, SO FOLLOW IT
   ALL THE WAY.  AT THE END THERE WILL
   BE A SAFE.  TURN AROUND AND OPEN IT
   AND YOU WILL FIND AN IRON KEY.  NOW
   YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY BACK UP.

5] IF YOU'RE SICK OF DUNGEONS, JUST
   WAIT.  WITH THE IRON KEY,  YOU CAN
   ENTER "DUNGEON OF DEATH" (BOTTOM
   RIGHT OF CONTINENT).  AGAIN FIGHT
   YOUR WAY DOWN TO THE EIGHTH LEVEL
   (EVEN HARDER), AND FIND THE SAFE.
   OPENING THIS ONE WILL REVEAL A
   DIAMOND RING.  THIS ALLOWS YOU TO
   ENTER -GULP- MANTOR'S MOUNTAIN!
   GETTING OUT OF THIS DUNGEON MAY BE
   EASIER THAN THE FIRST, IF YOU CAN
   FIND A CERTAIN CHUTE THAT GOES ALL
   THE WAY TO THE FIRST LEVEL.

6] MANTOR'S MOUNTAIN IS MORE THAN
   TWICE AS DEEP AS THE OTHER TWO.  TO
   BE PREPARED, BUY 100 FIREBALLS, 100
   MAGIC MISSILES, 50 STONE SPELLS, 50
   ARMOR ENHANCEMENT SPELLS, AND 5
   PASS WALL SPELLS.  ONCE AGAIN, YOU
   WILL HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY TO THE
   BOTTOM.  ONCE AT THE 16TH LEVEL,
   YOU WILL FIND AN ALMOST ENDLESS
   ONSLAUGHT OF MONSTERS.  SO AS SOON
   AS YOU KILL ONE, MOVE FORWARD TO
   TAKE ITS PLACE.  WHEN YOU'RE DONE
   KILLING ALL THOSE, YOU SHOULD FIND
   A NEARBY CHUTE.  THE 17TH LEVEL OF
   THIS DUNGEON IS SIMILAR TO THE 8TH
   OF "MOUNTAIN CATACOMBS".  THERE IS
   ONLY ONE WAY TO GO, SO YOU CAN'T
   GET LOST.  AFTER A LONG WHILE, SOME
   MONSTER WILL OFFER TO SHOW YOU THE
   WAY TO THE SAFE FOR ALMOST ALL YOUR
   GOLD.  GIVE IT TO HIM!  GO THROUGH
   THE DOOR AND THE SAFE WILL BE THERE
   WAITING FOR YOU.  AFTER YOU OPEN IT
   IT WILL DISAPPEAR, AND LEAVE A PIT.
   NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO HIT <RESET>
   AND GIVE YOURSELF 20,000 HIT POINTS
   UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST 15,000 AT
   THIS TIME ANYWAYS.  WHEN READY, HIT
   (C) TO CLIMB DOWN.

7] YOU WILL WIND UP IN MANTOR'S CASTLE
   WHICH IS FULL OF GUARDS.  DO NOT
   BOTHER SPRINKLING ANY POWDER; IT
   DOESN'T WORK.  KILL ALL THE GUARDS,
   AND FIND THE TWO ORANGE DOORS.  USE
   (H) TO HOLD YOUR GOLD KEY, AND
   (O)PERATE IT TO OPEN THE LEFT DOOR.
   WHEN IT'S OPEN, HOLD YOUR TRUMPET.
   MANTOR WILL START TO ATTACK YOU.
   JUST KEEP HEADING TO THE LEFT, AND
   WHEN YOU GET RIGHT NEXT TO HIM,
   (O)PERATE IT.  AN IMAGE OF MESRON
   WILL APPEAR, AND TELL YOU THAT HE
   GAVE YOU THE ANSWER.  THE ONLY REAL
   OBJECT THAT MESRON GAVE YOU WAS THE
   MAGIC POWDER, SO HOLD AND OPERATE
   THAT.  MANTOR WILL DIE, LEAVING A
   MAGIC BOOK OF SPELLS.  GO DIRECTLY
   EAST TO THE OTHER ORANGE DOOR, THEN
   HOLD AND OPERATE THE GOLD KEY.  THE
   DOOR WILL OPEN.  GO DOWN TO THE
   MACHINE, THEN HOLD AND OPERATE THE
   MAGIC BOOK OF SPELLS.  BOOM!  THE
   LAND OF QUESTRON IS SAVED.  NOW TO
   GET YOUR AWARD.  GO BACK TO WHERE
   MANTOR WAS, THEN OPERATE THE BOOK
   AGAIN.  YOU WILL WIND UP ON TOP OF
   MESRON'S CASTLE.  ENTER THAT, AND
   GO TO THE KING'S CHAMBERS.  THE
   REST WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

carry, and it's not allowed into the cosmop. At the start it contains the
jetpack and a fuel capsule. EXAMINE KUBE to check contents.

LASER SWORD
 A weapon. ACTIVATE LASER first, then FIRE LASER (or KILL XXXX). You must
de-activate it afterwards or it explodes. In an emergency it's best to have
it activated as you may not have time to do this and fire it too. Use it to
kill the guard at the armoury and the policer, and to cut open the museum
case for the bone. On Tropos you must hide it in the kube to avoid arrest.
Apparently unlimited ammunition.

 RISE OF THE DRAGON
       Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 The year is 2053. You are Blade Hunter, private investigator and former cop,
living in the decaying city of Los Angeles, California. On the morning of July
31st, you wake up in your dingy, one-bedroom apartment to find three messages
waiting on your VidPhone, two of them urgent....

 That's the beginning of RISE OF THE DRAGON. In this walkthru, you'll be guided
step by step through the next five days of Blade Hunter's life. You'll
investigate a series of drug-related deaths and uncover a conspiracy to destroy
Los Angeles and take over the world. You'll discover the meaning of true love
and come face to face with true terror. In the end, you'll confront the ancient
Oriental god, Bahumat, and only one of you will walk away from the confrontation
alive. Not a bad way to spend a week....
Press <CR> for more !



CompuServe CIS:TEG-15066


 In the paragraphs that follow, I'll assume that you're using a mouse to control
the game action, and that you've at least glanced through the instructions for
using the RISE OF THE DRAGON interface. If not, you might want to take time out
to do so now.

 During the game there will be occasional events that can't be predicted
precisely in this walkthru. Time is always passing during the game and certain
events occur like clockwork, whether or not you're prepared for them. I'll try
to keep the timing reasonably loose as I walk you through these five days of
Blade's life. But if you dawdle too much, you may find that events in the game
world are getting ahead of you. If this happens, you may have to restore to an
earlier part of the game, or even start again from the beginning.

 Occasionally, the game will be interrupted by semi-animated sequences depicting
events elsewhere in Los Angeles. These sequences are preceded by the word
"Meanwhile," and will happen at fairly regular intervals. Because there's no way
to know exactly where these sequences will occur relative to your progress in
the game, I won't mention them in the walkthru (except in cases where the
sequences represent significant advances in the plot or are triggered by
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15069

specific actions on the part of your character). But don't be surprised to find
your actions interrupted by one of these sequences at places where no such
interruption is mentioned in this walkthru.

 All clear? Then, let's get started.

 DRESSING FOR THE PART

 The game begins in Blade Hunter's apartment. A helicopter buzzes perpetually
past the window, rattling the overhead lamp, and sending flickering shadows up
and down the walls of the room. Blade has just awakened from a sound night's
sleep and is now standing around in his undershorts. So, the first thing you'll
want to do is put some clothes on the poor guy. Use the mouse pointer to drag
that pile of clothing from the floor into Blade's inventory icon (the rectangle
containing the tiny silhouette of Blade in the lower right-hand corner of the
screen). Then, drag the trench coat from Blade's coat rack into the inventory.
Finally, aim the mouse pointer at the inventory icon and click the right mouse
button to bring up the main inventory window.

 See the picture of Blade in his Fruit-of-the-Looms? Drag the pile of clothing
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15071

over the picture of Blade and let go of the mouse button. Blade will get
dressed. Much better! Now, drag the trench coat over the picture of Blade and
he'll put that on. Why would Blade (or anybody in their right mind) wear a
trench coat in Los Angeles in July? Because he's a private eye, of course.
Private eyes always wear trench coats; it's part of the job.

 Put the inventory window away by clicking on the box marked EXIT. Notice the
flickering red light on Blade's VidPhone? That means he's got a message or three
waiting on his answering machine. Aim the mouse pointer at the VidPhone (on the
desk behind Blade's bed), and the pointer will turn into a tiny magnifying
glass, indicating that you can take a closer look at the VidPhone and other
items on the desk. Click the left mouse button to ZOOM IN on the VidPhone.

 (Most, but not all, of the mouse-clicking you'll do in the game will involve
the left mouse button. From now on, when I tell you to click the mouse button,
assume that you should click the left button unless told otherwise.)

 Now, you should be looking at a close-up of Blade's desk, dominated by the
rather clunky apparatus of the VidPhone. (Blade can't afford one of the fancier
models.) To learn more about the items on the desk, point at each one and click
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15073

the right mouse button; a description box will pop up and give you more
information about each. To operate the VidPhone, click on the power switch, just
above the upper left-hand corner of the computer-like keyboard. The VidPhone
screen will announce that there is a message waiting for William Hunter --
that's you, Blade -- from Mayor Vincenzi. To read the message, click on the
remote control device lying to the left of the empty can of bio-beer. The remote
will pop into position at the top of the screen and present you with four
buttons. Click on the one labeled PLAY. Mayor Vincenzi's face will appear on the
VidPhone screen.

 THE STORY UNFOLDS

 The Mayor will tell you that more kids have been dying in the same horrible
manner that his daughter, Chandra, died. (The Mayor's daughter's death is the
case on which Blade is currently working. For more details, read the comic book
that came in the game box, and watch the introductory sequence that precedes the
game.) He wants you to find the cause of this epidemic and suggests that you
look up a friend of his daughter -- someone called The Jake -- at a place called
the Pleasure Dome. In case you need it, he faxes you a picture of his daughter,
showing how she looked after she died. It's not, so to speak, a pretty picture.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-15075

As the message ends, the picture pops out of the tiny fax machine next to the
VidPhone. Use the mouse pointer to drag the picture onto the inventory icon.

 Click on the button labeled NEXT. The second message on the answering machine
is from Momar's Cars. Left-click on PLAY and watch the message. Why, it's an
unsolicited advertisement! It looks like things really haven't changed much by
the middle of the 21st century.

 Ignore this ad (it has nothing to do with the story that follows) and click on
NEXT. The third message is from Karyn Sommers. Click on PLAY and you'll learn
that Karyn is your girlfriend. She's mad at you because you promised to take her
out last night and didn't show up. As if that wasn't bad enough, it seems that
you left your keys at her apartment, and she's threatening to flush them down
the toilet! She'll be at the Bureau of Records, if you have the nerve to
confront her in person.

 That's the last message on the VidPhone, so click on DONE. See the red button
on the panel resembling a floppy disk drive just above the keyboard? Click on
the red button and your personal I.D. card will pop out of the slot. (It must
not have been a floppy drive after all.) Drag the I.D. card onto the inventory
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-15077

icon; you'll need it later.

 Before you leave the VidPhone screen, drag the ammo clip from the extreme
lower-left corner of the screen onto the inventory icon. Finally, move the mouse
pointer to the far right side of the screen. The pointer will turn into an exit
sign. Click to EXIT the VidPhone screen and return to Blade's apartment.

 RISE OF THE DRAGON
       Part 2

 GETTING IT TOGETHER

 Move the mouse pointer to the cabinet above Blade's sink and it will change
into a magnifying glass again. ZOOM IN on the cabinet by clicking on the mouse
to get a better look at the items Blade keeps in his "kitchen." Right-click on
each to see what they are. Then click on the cabinet handles to open the
cabinet. Uh-oh, it's locked. Wonder where Blade keeps his keys? Hey, didn't
Karyn say something about keys?

 Play with the water taps to turn the water on and off, then move the mouse
pointer to either side of the screen, and click to EXIT the cabinet screen. It's
about time to hit the road, but you really should go to the bathroom first. Aim
the mouse pointer at the bathroom door and click to EXIT the apartment and enter
the bathroom.
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-15080


 Click on the shower controls to take a shower and on the toilet handle to
flush. (Maybe you should have done this before Blade got dressed.) Then, click
on the medicine chest to open it. There are two items inside: a first-aid kit
and a bottle of NaPent (an "aerosol personal protection device"). Drag both of
these into Blade's inventory, then move the mouse pointer to either side of the
screen, and EXIT the bathroom.

 A private eye needs a weapon, but so far we haven't seen any guns in Blade's
apartment. Maybe he hides his gun in the sort of place where fictional tough
guys always like to keep their guns, the kind of place where he can reach it in
a hurry if somebody tries to break into his apartment in the middle of the
night. Click on Blade's pillow to move it out of the way and, sure enough,
there's Blade's pistol. Drag it onto the inventory icon. Then, click on the
inventory icon (with the left button, not the right) to call up the inventory
window. Drag the ammo clip over the gun to load it, then click on the box marked
EXIT to get the inventory window out of the way.

 MOVING AROUND TOWN

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15082

 We're ready to go. Move the pointer to the extreme left side of the screen and
click to EXIT the apartment. You'll find yourself in the hallway next to Blade's
door. The door will swish closed almost immediately. You can reopen it by
inserting Blade's I.D. card in the panel to the right of the door. (To use the
I.D. card, click on the inventory icon, and drag the card off the inventory.
Then, move it to the panel and release it.) If you should accidentally leave
Blade's I.D. card in his apartment -- in the VidPhone, say -- you can get back
into the apartment by manipulating the red water spigot in the upper left-hand
corner of the screen with your mouse pointer. But this only works once, so try
not to get locked out too often.

 Before we leave the building, let's take a look at the other end of the
hallway. Move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen and click to EXIT
this half of the hallway. You'll find yourself looking out on a silhouetted
landscape of construction girders. Click on a few things to see what they are,
but don't walk off any girders without saving your game first: It's a long drop
to street level.

 Move the mouse pointer back to the bottom of the screen and click to EXIT.
You'll be outside of Blade's doorway again. See the elevator at the end of the
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15085

hallway? There are two buttons next to the sliding doors, one for up and one for
down. Click on the UP button to take a quick ride to the roof. Once on the roof,
look around for a moment, then click on the elevator button to get a ride back
down to Blade's apartment. Now, click on the DOWN button to EXIT the building
altogether.

 Welcome to the Compton M-way station. You can get an idea of the caliber of
Blade's neighborhood from the stylish graffiti on the wall, and the homeless
gentleman snoozing on the floor. ZOOM IN on that route map in the center of the
screen so that you can catch a ride to a better class of neighborhood.

 The route map shows you all the places that you can get to via the M-way. There
will be more such places later as you piece together the clues that will solve
the case, but for now, there are only four. To go to one of the places shown on
the map, point at the text box containing the name of the location you want to
visit, and click with the mouse. You'll be transported there in a mere spin of
the hard disk. (Clicking on one of these text boxes with the right mouse button
instead of the left will tell you how long it takes to get to that particular
location, in case you're pressed for time.)

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15087

 PATCHING THINGS UP

 The Mayor suggested you visit the Pleasure Dome, but let's go to City Hall
first and try to patch things up with Blade's girlfriend Karyn. Click on the
City Hall box and presto! We're standing on a street corner somewhere in the
vicinity of Chinatown. See the old Chinese derelict sprawled against the wall?
Aim the mouse pointer at him and click to have a brief conversation. Then, talk
with the flower vendor to his right. Let him sell you a bouquet of roses.
They're expensive, but they'll get you back into Karyn's good graces.

 To buy the roses, you'll need to wait until the inventory window pops up, then
drag your I.D. card out of the inventory with the mouse. Drop it on the vendor.
It'll reappear in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, along with a dozen
roses. Drag both into your inventory. (Whenever someone gives you an object in
this game, it first appears in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. Always
remember to drag these objects into your inventory before leaving the screen. If
you forget, they may or may not be waiting for you when you get back. The same
holds true for objects that you drop yourself.)

 EXIT to the left side of the screen. City Hall is a large imposing building
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15089

with a crowd of people streaming by outside. Point and click at the front door
to go inside.

 Once in the main lobby of City Hall, it's just you and Jenni the receptionist.
Talk with Jenni and she'll let it be known that she has more than a casual
attraction toward you. Ignore her come-on (or, if you're feeling particularly
adventurous, call her bluff), and tell her you want to see Karyn Sommers. She'll
relent and break off the conversation. EXIT through the door marked Records.

 There are three people working in the Bureau of Records. Karyn is the one in
the middle. Point at her and click. She'll tell you what she thinks of
you...again. Tell her you're sorry and that you brought some roses. Your
inventory will pop up; give the roses to Karyn. This will cool her anger, but
she'll insist on another date to make up for the one you missed. Take her up on
it. Tell her you'll see her that evening at 7:30. (Don't forget the time. You'll
want to be at Karyn's apartment, which is visible as one of the text boxes on
the M-way map, before 7:30 arrives!)

 Karyn will give you the keys you left at her apartment. Pick them up and drag
them into your inventory. Then, point at the bottom of the screen and click to

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15091

EXIT. Once back in the main lobby, try going through the doors marked "Mayor"
and "Police Headquarters." You won't be able to get into the Mayor's office, but
you can barge past Jenni and into Police Headquarters. This won't do you a lot
of good, though. You'll be stopped by the guard inside.

 WAREHOUSE DISTRICT

 Retrace your steps back to the main lobby, then out to the front steps, and
back to the street corner where you bought the roses from the flower vendor. See
that small alley leading off on the right side of the screen? Point at it and
click to EXIT. You'll enter the warehouse district. Click on the open gate at
the right-hand edge of the screen and EXIT to the large warehouse on the other
side of the fence. There are two places around the warehouse where you can ZOOM
IN for a closer look. Examine them carefully. One is an electrical panel that
appears to be part of the power supply for the warehouse cooling system. The
other is the doorway of a loading dock.

 EXIT back through the warehouse gate, but don't leave the warehouse district.
There's a small alley below and to the left of the large cooling fan set in the
warehouse wall. EXIT to this alley. Inside, you'll find a small passage marked
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-15093

KEEP OUT. Ignore the sign and EXIT into the passage. You'll find yourself inside
a small warehouse along with an ancient Asian gentleman in a shawl.

 The man's name is Chang Li. Talk with him and you'll learn that he already
knows your name, as well as your mission. After a brief exchange, he'll dismiss
you. Retrace your steps back to the street corner, then EXIT to the M-way
station. (Point at the bottom of the screen and click.)

 DISCOVERING KEY ITEMS

 Where to next? First, let's head back to Blade's apartment to see what we can
do with the keys that Karyn gave you. ZOOM IN on the M-way route map and click
on the box marked Blade's. Once back at your apartment, drag the I.D. card out
of your inventory, and use it to unlock your door. Enter the apartment, ZOOM IN
on the cabinets above the sink, and use the key to unlock the cabinet doors.
Inside the cabinet you'll find four mini-bombs, a candy bar, and a wire tester.
Drag them all into your inventory, then close the cabinet door, and EXIT back to
the apartment. EXIT the apartment, remove your I.D. card from the door panel,
put it in your inventory, then click on the DOWN elevator button to get back to
the M-way station.

 RISE OF THE DRAGON
       Part 3

 PLEASURE DOME

 Now it's time to check out the Pleasure Dome. Zoom in on the M-way route map
and click on the Pleasure Dome text box. You'll be transported to a sleazy
alleyway outside a high-tech nightclub with a blinking neon sign out front.
Click on the front door and EXIT to the club. You'll be stopped at the door by a
pair of sinister looking guards. Wait a few seconds while they scan you
electronically. Hm, they don't seem to like that gun you're carrying! Don't
hassle them (unless you're prepared to save the game and try again after they've
pounded your skull into the pavement). Tell them that they can have your gun
and, when the inventory window pops up, drag your weapon over to the woman at
the, um, gun-check window.

 The guards will now ask if you have anything else for them. If you plan to see
Press <CR> for more !





CompuServe CIS:TEG-15098

that gun again, better give them a little something nice. Hand the candy bar to
the fat guard and he'll give you a claim check in return. Put it in your
inventory. Then, EXIT through the front door of the club.

 Inside, you'll see people chatting, scantily-clad women dancing, and a trio of
gamblers playing cards. Talk with the gamblers. Only the woman in the gold hood
will give you the time of day, and even she won't tell you anything useful. When
you're finished talking, EXIT through the door marked Bar.

 The big man behind the bar is Mujalambo. Talk with him. After a ritual exchange
of insults, ask him about The Jake, the friend of Chandra's that the Mayor
mentioned to you in the phone call this morning. He'll direct you to the man at
the end of the bar.

 Chat with the man at the end of the bar. Tell him that you're looking for The
Jake, then tell him that a friend of The Jake's is in trouble. He'll give you
some lip, but don't lose your temper. Tell him that the friend is Chandra
Vincenzi and that she's dead. He won't believe you. In fact, he'll break off the
conversation. So, show him the picture of Chandra that the Mayor faxed you. The
shock of seeing Chandra's corpse will bring him around fast.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15100


 Surprise! The guy at the end of the bar is The Jake himself! He'll pull you
aside for some serious conversation in his "office" -- a secluded booth in the
corner of the bar. Talk with him and he'll drop the name of a drug pusher named
Chen. Save the game at this point and interrogate The Jake about Chen. If you
play your cards right, he'll give you Chen's address. If not, restore the game
to the beginning of the conversation and try again. (As with many of the
conversations in this game, there are several dozen possible conversational
sequences that you can have with The Jake. Roughly half of these lead to The
Jake giving you Chen's address. We're not going to restrict you to a specific
conversational sequence in this walkthru since so many possible sequences will
do the job.)

 When the conversation ends, EXIT The Jake's "office," then EXIT the bar.
(Before you go, you might want to talk with some of the other patrons of the
bar. But if you decide to engage the services of the hooker named Candi, be sure
to save the game first!) Once back in the room with the gamblers, EXIT to the
left of the screen and take a look around in the next room. There's nothing
useful here, just some atmospheric scenery. When you've seen enough, EXIT to the
right, then go back out the front door of the Pleasure Dome.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15103


 KEEPING YOUR SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS

 Give your claim check to the fat guard and he'll return your gun. Drag it into
your inventory and go back to the M-way. This time, when you ZOOM IN on the
M-way route map, you'll notice a new location: Chen Lu's. This is the address of
the drug pusher that The Jake told you about. Should we go there now? No.
There's no reason to cram too much action into the first day of this adventure,
especially when Karyn is expecting you to show up at her apartment at 7:30.
Instead of going to Chen Lu's, click on the box labeled Karyn's.

 Now, you're standing in the hallway outside Karyn's apartment. Knock on the
door of Apartment 40 and see if she's home. No answer? Okay, you can wait around
until she arrives. So you don't get bored, use the fast forward button on the
inventory window to kill some time. (Click on the inventory icon to bring up the
inventory window. Then, click on the button marked with the ">>" symbol at the
top of the window. Every click will advance the time by an hour.) Before you
know it, Karyn will open her door and invite you inside. At this point, you can
sit back and watch a sequence of scenes depicting your date. When it's over,
you'll be standing outside the door of your apartment at 12 noon the next day.

 CHEN LU

 Ready to investigate Chen Lu? Click on the DOWN elevator button to enter the
M-way station, call up the route map, and click on Chen Lu's. On your way into
Chen's building, you'll literally bump into a hulking blonde-haired thug with an
eye patch who's on his way out. When you see the door of Chen's apartment,
slightly ajar, EXIT through the door and into Chen's living room. You'll see
Chen almost immediately, writhing in obvious distress on the floor, his body
covered with small white patches. There's nothing you can do for Chen at this
point, so ZOOM IN on his VidPhone (to the left of the large screen television),
and turn it on by pressing the POWER button. (You'll be interrupted by a
MEANWHILE sequence at this point, showing the police dispatching units to Chen's
apartment.) Drag Chen's I.D. card out of the slot and into your inventory, then
EXIT back to the living room.
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-15107


 There are two ways you can handle the rest of this sequence. Either look around
Chen's apartment until the cops arrive and arrest you -- you'll be taken to
jail, then released the next morning on the Mayor's orders. Or you can leave the
apartment and hang out somewhere else for a few minutes while the police do
their work. If you choose to get arrested, you'll lose a full day's time, which
makes the timing a bit tighter on at least part of what follows. But you'll also
get to see some scenes you wouldn't get to see if you weren't get arrested.
Either way, return to Chen's apartment as soon as possible using the I.D. you
swiped from Chen's VidPhone to open the door. (Drag it from your inventory onto
the panel next to the door. Remember to drag it back into your inventory before
you EXIT to the apartment.)

 Once you're back in Chen's living room, ZOOM IN on his VidPhone again, and
insert Chen's I.D. in the slot. Some information will appear on the VidPhone
display, including Chen's name, address, phone number, social security number,
and gun permit number. Notice how the number 0772 keeps recurring in all of
these? Maybe that's significant....

 Use the VidPhone to view Chen's messages. (There's only one and it will explain
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15110

why Chen got iced.) Then drag Chen's I.D. back into your inventory. EXIT back to
the living room, and from there, EXIT to the bathroom (the door in the center of
the rear wall). See that tiny white rectangle next to the filthy sink? Pick it
up and put it in your inventory. If you examine it, you'll learn that it's a
device for administering measured doses of drugs directly through the skin. It
looks a lot like the patches that were covering Chen just before he died.

 EXIT back to the living room, then EXIT around the corner next to the VidPhone,
into Chen's bedroom. Examine the dragon statue next to the ventilator fans.
Notice those glaring eyes? Click on one and the statue will descend into its
pedestal, revealing a safe hidden behind it. ZOOM IN on the safe.

 There's a numeric keypad on the front of the safe, with a tiny video display
big enough for a four-digit combination. Four digits? How about 0772? Type those
four digits, then click on the door handle to open the safe.

 Inside the safe is another candy bar and a scroll with some kind of Oriental
writing on it. Drag them both into your inventory, close the safe, and EXIT back
to the bedroom.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15112

 CITY HALL

 You're finished with Chen's apartment. Go back to City Hall -- I'm sure that
you can find your way there by now -- and visit Karyn in the Bureau of Records.
Talk to her and she'll ask if there's anything you want her to look at. Tell her
there is. Drag the drug patch out of your inventory and give it to her. She'll
send it to the lab for analysis. Then, show her Chen's I.D. She'll run it
through the computer, which will turn up pictures of two of Chen's accomplices:
Jonny Qwong and the Snake. (The Snake looks a lot like the guy you ran into
outside Chen's apartment last night.) Qwong's address is also in the computer.

 Finally, show her the scroll with the Chinese writing on it. She won't
recognize the writing, but she'll suggest you show it to a Chinese scholar.
Where have you met a wise-looking Chinese person recently? Ah, yes....

 CHANG LI

 Gather up the I.D. and the scroll, bid Karyn a fond farewell, and return to the
warehouse district. (Go back out to the street and EXIT to the alley next to the
flower vendor.) Remember where you met Chang Li in the warehouse? Seek him out
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15114

again. Talk to him and he'll tell you about a time of prophecies, about a
terrible doom that awaits humankind, and the hero that will save them. He seems
to think that the hero is you.

 Humor the old boy. If you tell him that you think he's full of stuff, he'll
clam up, so pretend to go along. As soon as the topic comes up, offer to show
him the scroll (or "sample of calligraphy," as it's called in the menus). He'll
translate it for you. It says something about the ancient god Bahumat, a date in
the VERY near future, and the Hollywood Reservoir. Bahumat is the god mentioned
in the legend and the hero who will slay him is somebody named "Knife" (or
"Blade," perhaps?).

 To aid you in your upcoming battle with Bahumat, Chang Li gives you a bunch of
goodies, including a fortune cookie with an incomprehensible message inside, a
tome of ancient wisdom, the stone of life, and a bullet-proof Kevlar vest.
Shovel all of it into your inventory, then call up the Main Inventory Window
(right-click on the inventory icon), and put on the Kevlar vest. (You'll have to
remove your trench coat, put on the vest, then put the trench coat back on
again.) Be sure to examine the new items in your inventory by right-clicking on
each one, then head back to the M-way.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15116


 There are a couple of new locations on the M-way map: the Reservoir and Jonny
Qwong's. Ignore them for the moment; go to the Pleasure Dome. Enter the club
(remember to give the guards your gun and pick up the claim check, though you
won't need to bribe them again), and head straight for the bar. Talk with The
Jake. He'll take you into his booth and give you a rundown on what's happening
in the city. Most pathways through this conversation end in desirable outcomes,
but be sure that you give The Jake your telephone number, and ask him to call
you later if anything comes up.

 Leave the Pleasure Dome, use your claim check to pick up your gun outside, and
return to the M-way. Go to Jonny Qwong's house. When you get there, you'll find
that it's patrolled by armed guards and that there's no way to get inside.
However, there's a manhole in the middle of the street that looks accessible.
Click on it and EXIT to the sewer. (The first time you try this, you'll be
interrupted by a comment from a street person about the size of the rats in the
sewer. Ignore him and try again.)

 JONNY QWONG'S VIDPHONE

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-15118

 In the sewer, ZOOM IN on the VidPhone trunk on the left wall. You'll find a
VidPhone access box with a locked cover. Remove one of the mini-bombs from your
inventory and attach it to the padlock. Wait for it to explode. Then, click on
the broken padlock to open the cover and reveal the contents of the box.

 Lord, look at all those wires and gauges! This must be a puzzle, right? Yes,
it's not only a puzzle, but a timed puzzle. Take too long to solve it and you'll
be eaten by rats; make a false move and you'll be electrocuted. It's a good idea
to save the game now (or even at the point where you entered the sewer) and
follow these instructions very carefully!

 Remove the wire testing kit (which is really a wire TAPPING kit) from your
inventory and drop it in the middle of all the wires in the phone box. Three
wire clips -- colored red, blue and yellow -- will appear at the bottom of the
screen, along with a picture of the kit itself. Close the door to the phone box
and ZOOM IN on the wiring diagram taped to the outside. The red, blue and yellow
arrows on the diagram show you where the three clips are to be attached inside.
Keep this diagram in mind and open the door again.

 You now have to attach the clips to the wires. See those two rapidly changing

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15120

gauges at the top of the phone box? NEVER attach a clip while the gauges are in
the red or you'll be electrocuted. With that in mind, attach the red clip at the
top of the long red wire and the blue clip at the bottom of the long black wire.
(If you put a clip in the wrong place, it will simply pop back to the bottom
left-hand corner of the screen, where you can pick it up and try again.) See
those eight golden connectors along that vertical post in the middle of the box?
Attach the yellow clip to the post at the position of the second connector from
the bottom. If you get the yellow clip in the right place, Blade will tell you
that the job is done. If you get it wrong, a light on the wire tester will start
flashing. Remove the yellow clip FAST before you get electrocuted, and try
again. Once you're done, close the box and get out of the sewer before the rats
devour you.

 ENDING THE DAY WITH A BANG

 EXIT to the M-way and head back to City Hall. Enter the alley next to the
flower vendor. Step through the open gate into the area around the big
warehouse. ZOOM IN on the electrical panel. Ready to throw a monkey wrench into
Bahumat's works? Take one of the mini-bombs from your inventory and attach it to
the panel, then sit back and watch the fireworks!

 The warehouse is now a smoldering ruin. EXIT back to the M-way and return to
your apartment. There's nothing more to do tonight, so use the fast forward
button on the inventory window to accelerate time. Check every hour or so to see
if the button is flashing on your VidPhone. If it is, read any new messages
using the method described in the first part of this walkthru. (ZOOM IN on the
phone, pop up the remote, insert your I.D. in the phone, and press the

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15124

appropriate buttons. Reverse the process when done. Remember to drag your I.D.
into your inventory before EXITing back to your apartment.) You should intercept
at least one call to Jonny Qwong's number from somebody named Deng Hwang. You
should also see at least one "Meanwhile" sequence showing the consequences of
the explosion at the warehouse. At 1 a.m., Blade will crawl into bed and go to
sleep.

 When you wake up the next afternoon, head straight to City Hall and visit Karyn
in her office. She'll give you the lab report based on the drug patch you gave
her the day before. It's in the form of a video tape, depicting the animated
structure of a new drug called MTZ that instantly mutates human DNA. Could this
be the stuff that's killed a lot of kids on the street, including the Mayor's
daughter?

 While you're talking with Karyn, ask her about Deng Hwang. She'll start to run
a computer trace on the name, then find that's somebody's blocked access to the
file. Tell her to throw caution to the winds and override the block. She'll give
you some cryptic information about Deng Hwang.

 GETTING TO THE MAYOR
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15126


 Break off the conversation and pick up the video tape. EXIT to the main lobby
of City Hall and click on the Mayor's door. Jenni, the receptionist, will try to
stop you. Tell her you have to see the Mayor about an urgent matter. She'll try
to dissuade you, but stick your guns. Finally, she'll call the Mayor and get his
okay. Click on his door again and EXIT to the Mayor's office.

 Talk to the Mayor. The conversation that follows is a bit tricky, but here's a
sequence of menu choices that will produce optimal results:

 1. "You should show a little courtesy to someone who has information that could
cost you the next election."

 2. "I found out who killed your daughter."

 3. "No effin' way. I'm finished with this crap. Show me the door."

 Hand the Mayor the video tape when prompted. At the end of the conversation,
he'll give you a Los Angeles Police Department pass. Put it in your inventory
and EXIT the office.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15128


 Now that you have a pass, you can enter Police Headquarters. Click on the
Headquarters door, give your pass to the guard inside, and EXIT to the hallway
behind him. (Be sure to pick up your pass again after the guard is finished with
it.) You'll see some impressive looking artillery on the wall. Drag it into your
inventory; it may come in handy later. Then, EXIT all the way back to the M-way.

 When you click on the route map, you'll see that another location has been
added to the map: Deng Hwang's. Go there and look around. It appears to be some
kind of factory. Talk to the guard at the gate. He'll tell you that you can't
get in without a pass. Look around a little more, then EXIT back to the M-way.
Visit the Reservoir, take yet another look around, then head back to your
apartment.

 There's nothing else to do for the moment. It's now the afternoon of August 2nd
(or 3rd, depending on whether you allowed yourself to get arrested back at
Deng's apartment). Use the fast forward button on the inventory window to
accelerate forward to August 4th, pausing periodically to check the VidPhone for
calls. You should see a "Meanwhile" sequence in which Karyn is kidnaped, and
receive a nasty call from Deng Hwang. At 1 a.m. each evening, Blade will crawl
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15130

into bed for a night's sleep.

 HOLLYWOOD RESERVOIR

 On the morning of the 4th, you'll find a call waiting on the VidPhone from The
Jake. He'll ask you to meet him at the warehouse at 8:30 that evening. Should
you head to the warehouse? Not quite yet. While still in your apartment, fast
forward ahead one hour. You'll see a "Meanwhile" sequence in which Bahumat
announces to the people of Los Angeles that he is going to poison them with the
drug MZT. Remember what Chang Li said about Hollywood Reservoir? Bahumat must be
planning to drop the MZT in the Reservoir!

 Go to the Reservoir. Nothing will be happening when you get there, but take
precautions anyway. Call up the main inventory window by right-clicking on the
inventory icon. Drag the gun you picked up at police headquarters over the
picture of Blade, and release it. Blade will take the gun in hand. Then, fast
forward to evening. You'll be interrupted by a brief "Meanwhile" sequence in
which Bahumat's henchmen are dispatched to the Reservoir. When the Reservoir
reappears, three things will have been added: a truck, a hovercar, and a guard.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15132

 Quick! The shooting's about to start, so save the game! The guard will see you
and start shooting at you, as will several other guards concealed at various
points around the Reservoir. Aim your mouse pointer at them. Notice how the
mouse pointer now looks like a set of cross-hairs? That's your gunsight. Fire at
the guards by clicking on the left mouse button. If you shoot them before they
riddle you with bullet holes (represented by the bloody holes rapidly appearing
along the left side of the screen), you'll stop them from poisoning the
Reservoir; otherwise, you'll die and be treated to a sequence depicting the "End
of Life in Los Angeles As We Know It."

 WAREHOUSE DISTRICT

 Keep restoring to the beginning of this sequence until you win. Then, click on
the hovercar. When the control panel of the hovercar appears, click on the route
map, and choose City Hall as your destination. You'll land on the front steps of
City Hall. It's almost time for your appointment with The Jake. Hurry to the
warehouse district, then fast forward until The Jake shows up.

 (If you arrive too late, The Jake will be dead when you get to the warehouse.

 The Jake will show up slightly early for your meeting...with the Snake pointing
a gun at his head. You are given a chance to save your game, then you are
plunged into an arcade sequence, the goal of which is to shoot your way through
hordes of gun-wielding bad guys to save The Jake's life. Instructions for
playing arcade sequences are in the manual. If you hate arcade games and manage
to lose this one repeatedly, you'll be given a chance to WIN THE ARCADE after
you've died five times. You may take this opportunity or leave it, as you see
fit. If you want to die in a hurry, just jump repeatedly into the pool of toxic
chemicals beneath the loading dock where the sequence starts.

life, and give you the Snake's I.D. card. Put it in your inventory and return to
the hovercar. (You left it on the steps of City Hall, remember?) Get back into
the hovercar and fly to Deng Hwang's. You'll land on the roof of Hwang's
factory. Take the elevator to the lobby. Talk to the receptionist. Tell her that
she reminds you of somebody. When she recognizes you from high school, tell her
that you remember her well, and that you'd like to go out with her for drinks
that evening. When she refuses to let you into the security room, tell her
you'll take her out to a movie. Then, enter the security room through the red
door on the left of the screen.

 Move fast in the security room: The receptionist isn't going to let you stay in

there forever. (It's a good idea to save the game at the beginning of this
sequence, in case you need to start over.) Click on the control panel beneath
the large video screen. See those lock switches in the upper right corner of the
panel marked LOCK and UNLOCK? Set all of them to UNLOCK, except for the Break
Switch, which you should set to LOCK. (This will lock the guards in the break
room.)

 You can't do anything else until you deactivate the security systems. Push down
on the large bar marked Security Systems. No good. You have to enter a manual
override sequence by pressing the buttons with the colored squares over them in
the proper sequence. And what's the proper sequence? Remember the fortune cookie
that Chang Li gave you? Take a look at it now, and note the sequence of letters
inscribed on it: RYP YWP YRPWRY PBW. It seems to consist of the letters R, Y, P,
W and B repeated in random order. Could those be the initials of the five colors
above the security buttons -- Red, Yellow, Purple, White, and Blue? Yes! Push
the buttons in this order:

 Red, Yellow, Purple, Yellow, White, Purple, Yellow, Red, Purple, White, Red,
Yellow, Purple, Blue, White.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15388

 Great! Now the security systems are disabled! Press the button for 100KV - OFF,
then EXIT back to the security room and into the lobby.

 The receptionist will call security, but it's too late: You've disabled the
alarm. EXIT to the hallway behind the security desk. Enter the red door on the
right. See the electrical box on the wall? Open the top and bottom doors of the
box. Throw the switch behind the top door, then use the screwdriver next to the
sink to remove the panel behind the lower door. (Drag the screwdriver from the
sink to the panel, then release it over the panel.) A mass of wires will appear
behind the panel. Drag the wires from the box to your inventory and EXIT back to
the hallway.

 ENDGAME

 This time, enter the red door in the middle. Inside, you'll find Karyn! She's
strapped into a chair, with some sort of automated gadget around her neck that's
about to inject her with the deadly MTZ! Connect the wires you grabbed in the
last room to the wires surrounding Karyn. (Drag the wires from your inventory
and release them over Karyn's body.) Then ZOOM IN on Karyn's head. Detach the
three wires attached to the collar around Karyn's neck by clicking on the points
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15623

where they connect to the collar.

 You've saved Karyn's life! Sit back and watch as you and Karyn flee Deng
Hwang's guards, only to find yourselves trapped and at the mercy of Deng Hwang's
minions. Suddenly Deng Hwang himself appears and transforms himself into...the
ancient god Bahumat! Another arcade sequence begins. As before, you'll have the
option to WIN THE ARCADE after you've died five times.

 Everything following the arcade sequence is animation. Sit back and enjoy your
victory. You've saved Los Angeles from the evil god Bahumat and his disciples.
More importantly, you've saved your true love Karyn; in the end, the two of you
walk off together in the somber glow of the street lamps.

 FINAL NOTES

 Although this walkthru should give you all the information you need to play
through RISE OF THE DRAGON from beginning to end, there are a few avenues that
I've left unexplored. If you enjoyed the game your first time through, you might
want to play again with an eye toward exploring some of these undiscovered
possibilities. Here are a frw taings you might want to investigate the second
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15625

time around:

 The drug MZT is so deadly that no sane person would even think of slapping one
of those little white patches on his or her neck. But why not go a little crazy
and have Blade try the MZT patch from Chen's apartment on himself? Be sure to
save the game first!

 Blade would sure hate to see Karyn die in the chair where Deng Hwang imprisoned
her, but aren't you curious what would have happened if you hadn't released her
in time? Indulge yourself! Watch Karyn turn into yet another ugly mutant!

 There's a second method for disabling the security systems from the security
room panel. Check the comic book that came with the game. I leave the details
as, um, an exercise for the reader.

 Spraying the can of NaPent on characters in the game can produce interesting
effects. Instead of sweet-talking your way past the receptionist at Deng Hwang's
factory, try spritzing her with NaPent.

			Les Manley search for THE KING
			  Solved by Fabulous Furlough


     Well guys, after 3 or 4 days of SERIOUS playing I finished it..  Anything
in quotes is what you type in, everything else is either a description or it is
telling you where to move Les.

     Ok in the beginning you start off in you office, go around behind the desk
and "Open Desk" "Take Lunch" "Take Thermos"..Hey you..stop looking at Stella!!
Ok.. Now go out in the hall, and "Open Thermos", walk over to the water fountain
and "Fill Thermos with Water", "Close Thermos".  Now walk to the end of the hall
and into the Bosses office..  walk to the front of his desk, and
"Ask About Raise".  This part is kinda tricky..  You have to catch him looking
at Stella's Ass..  Keep pressing enter until he tells Stella to bring in your
file, then put your finger on the g key, and wait for Stella to give him the
file and turn, when she does, his eyes will go to look at her.. Press the G, and
you can finish your command before he can get his eyes back..Type "Get Keys".

  Now you have the keys, "Ask about Raise", then leave.  Walk down the hall and
to the front of the door by the water fountain.  "Unlock door with Keys", "Open
door"..  go in  and walk straight to the toolbox (in the middle of the floor)..
"Get ID".  Turn around and Leave "Close Door".  Now go to the Elevator and
"Press Button", enter the elevator, and you'll come out by the guard..  At this
point press the ESC key, and save your game.. Some fluke makes it bomb every
once in a while here.  Ok, your back.. walk in front of the guards desk and
"Get Dream".  Then open door, and go outside.  Once outside, cross the street,
and go off to the left, and continue 'till you get the overhead view of the
circus.  On the lower left corner of the screen you'll see a section of black
with a white border around it, and a break right between two trailers.  Walk to
this section, and you'll be 'Zoomed' in, and see the trailer in front of you.
Walk to the front of the trailer and "Knock Door", as soon as the colonel comes
to the door "Ask for Job", and give him time to finish telling you about your
job, and shut the door before leaving, or you'll have to do it all again.

  Walk over to the elephants and "Get Shovel", then after about 1 or 2 shovels
full of elephant dip, type "Drop Shovel".  Walk back to the trailer and "Knock
Door" again, "Take Ticket".  walk back between the breaks in the border, and
you'll be returned to the overhead view.  Walk to the gypsey wagon, this is
right beside the clown juggling the balls..  Walk to the front and type "Look"
this will zoom you in, and then you can walk up the steps using the PgUp, and
the right arrow, and eventually an Up arrow to get you in..  Once inside "Touch
Woman", she'll disappear, "Pet Lizard", "Get Card", "Get Wax", "Leave".

  Now that we have that stuff, walk over to the Strong man, and type "Look",
you'll get a close up, and see Luigi sitting bent over..  Walk over in front of
him and "Give Wax".  When he gets the weights up, "Take Rosin".  Now walk off
the screen, and you'll get the overhead view again.  Walk over to the 'Test-o-
strength' machine (Right in front of the Big Top), and type look, you'll see
a Popcorn Machine, walk to the front and type "Get Popcorn", then walk into the
Big Top at the top left corner of the screen.  You'll be confronted by a Lion
licking his lips and thinking that you are a steak..  "Get Jar from Bag" "Open
Jar","Drop Jar", and he'll lick the peanut butter.  Now walk to the right and
you'll see Frederick Von Leepov.  Walk to the front of Fred and "Give Rosin".
He'll take it, climb the ladder, and miss terribly.  "Take Cape", and walk to
the left and off the screen, and in front of the Lion.  "Drop Popcorn", "Get
Jar", walk off the screen to the left..Sometimes it doesn't like you going to
the left, so you have to walk forward (towards the screen) to make him get out.

  Now that we have all of that stuff, walk over behind Luigi (Strong Man), and
right beside the Fat Lady, and type look.  You will see Helmut Bean 'World's
Smallest Man'.  Walk to the front of his booth, and "Give Dream to Helmut",
"Take Helmut".  At his point, we are all done with the Circus, so leave out the
front gate by the ticket booths (By the Fence).  Walk to the right, and you'll
come out in front of the Bus Station.  Walk to the right from there, and you'll
come out in front of the BUS.  Walk right from there, and you'll come out in
front of a house, go up the steps, and "Knock Door", wait for her to say
something then "Show ID", and she'll let you in.  Go the the sofa and "Sit on
Sofa","Ask for Soda","Show Scarf","Spill Soda on Scarf".  She's gonna get PISSED
and throw you out.  Walk off the screen to the right, and you'll be by the fence
"Climb Fence".  Go to the clothes line, and "Get Scarf", come back to the fence
and "Climb Fence".  Go back to the left 'till you get to the Bus Depot again.
walk to the 'mailing' position and "Open Mailbox","Mail Helmut".

  Now that that is over with.  Go LEFT to the circus, and go back by the Test-O
Strength, and walk up on the test-o-strength, and he'll blast you into orbit. IF
you can't get blasted, try walking from side-to-side, and he'll get you.  You'll
land on a peice of land in Las Vegas.  From here, go Right, and you'll be in the
desert, Right again, and you'll see the Pay Phone.  walk to the front of the
phone, and type "Answer Phone".  Talk to Stella.. Nice Artwork Guys!  After the
converation is over, "Open Thermos","Drink Water from Thermos", and then walk
left 'till you come back to the screen with the Mailbox on it.  Walk to the
'mailing' position, and "Open Mailbox","Take Helmut","Close Mailbox".  Walk left
and you'll be in the front of the Casion Hotel.  Walk up the Steps, and use the
same Wiggle technique that you used to get into the gypsey wagon.  This will put
you in the Lobby, walk to the front counter, and "Page Mr. Fabulous", the guy
will do it, and you need to go up to the next room, and then left to the Pool.
Continue left 'till you see a woman sitting in a Chair, and an empty chair to
her left.  Walk to the front of the chair, and "Sit in Chair".  You will get to
see her..once again Nice Artwork guys.  she'll get you gassed up, and then get
up, and jump in the pool.  When this happens, "Get Glasses".  go back to the
right, and go back into the hotel, come back to the front, and go to the right
down the hallway.  You will come out in front of an elevator.  Walk towards the
elevator, and the doors will open for you.  Once inside, "Press Button", and
it'll take you to the 2nd Floor.  Get out of the elevator, and turn to the right
go until you see the cart, and then enter the room..  Once in the room, go into
the bathroom, this takes a couple of tries usually..  It is REALLY picky about
letting you into it..  "Get Floss".  Now come out, and get on the front side of
the bed, and "Sit on Bed","Get Up".  Walk to the door, and "Get Sign","Turn Sign
","Put sign on Door".  At this point, walk out to the Maid's cart and wait for
her to bend over to make the bed.  "Get Key", when she is bent over.  If you
don't make it, just go back in the room, and sit on the bed again.  After you
get the key, walk back to the left, and get back in the elevator, and "Press
Button".

  You will end up on the 3rd floor, usuall you have to do a HOME to get out of
the elevator.  Once inside the room, go to the left, and go to the Hot Tub.
You need to be by the faucets at the top of it.  Once you get there,
"Tie floss to Helmut","Lower Helmut into drain".  You get to see Helmut go
into the drain and get you a receipt for some laundry.  When he gets out
"Get Floss", and walk back to the elevator.  Once inside "Press Button", and
you'll come out on the bottom floor.  Walk to the Dry Cleaners, and in front of
the door type "Open Door", then walk in and "Give Receipt to Susie","Get Suit",
"Leave".  You are now through in the Hotel, walk to the left until you get
outside, and then "Hitchhike", and a VW Van will come by and get you, and take
you to Memphis.  Once there, you'll get a close up of 'The Kingdom'.  Walk off
the screen to the left so that you get an overhead view.  Walk down the streets
to the break between buildings on the right side of the street.  walk through,
and between the two buildings.  You are trying to get to the building that has
both a phone and restrooms, and is towards the top.  There is a small building
beside it on the bottom.  You want to walk between them, and you'll get a close
up of Red's Bar.  Walk to the front, and go in the Phone booth, and "Wear Suit".
WHen you come out, walk to the front door, and "Open Door", and go in.  Once on
stage "Sing"..  You'll do a nice rendition of 'The Pee Wee Herman', and win a
free pass to 'The Kingdom'.  Leave here, and go back to the kingdom gates which
are on the left of the road.  Once inside go to the front of the big house with
the attraction symbol out front.  Walk up the front steps and you are inside.

  Once inside, "Put Helmut in Mouth", and he'll disarm the alarm system.  Once
that is done, walk off the screen to the right, and walk behind the ropes so
that you can get to the stuff. "Get Microphone","Get Guitar", and walk back to
the left, and go into the kitchen.  (Top Left Room).  Walk to the back side of
the Table, and "Get Banana".  Walk back into the Living room, and go up the
steps.  At the top of the steps, go left, and it'll put you outside his bedroom.
Go into the bedroom, and go to the bureau.  Type "Open Bureau","Move mechanism".
a 'KingPole' will show up.  Move to the back of it and "Slide down Kingpole".
Once at the bottom type "Release Kingpole".  Walk to the back right side of the
bar and "Open Counter",go through and "Close Counter", walk to where you are
beching the clear spot on the counter (No Bottles or Napkins), and "Get Bread"
Once you have the bread, go to the spot in the counter where you can in and
"Make Sandwich".  This will make you Fat and look like Elvis..er..The King..
"Open Counter", and come out, and go to the door on the Right of the screen and
"Open Door", and go through the door.  From here you are through in the House,
so leave the house, which usually means that you have to walk towards the screen
and you'll get the overhead view of you again.  Got out onto the street, and go
back to Red's.  "Open Door", and go in..  Hang on one command left!! "Sing".
You'll get trampled by adoring Fans, but you have the resurrection card that you
got from the Gypsy, so you are ok.  You'll be brought back to life, and see the
ending.  I got 460 points out of this, I don't know what I missed, if you find
anything, leave me a message.. I'd like to know.

     How to Solve

      SEX VIXENS
   from Outer Space

As if you really cared...

This is not exactly a difficult game. The toughest parts are figuring out
the exact wording that the program wants, which can be a bitch and a half.
Cheating by viewing the SEXVIXEN.EXE file reveals most of the syntax.

Anything in []'s is what you type (followed by a c/r...)

Anyway, here we go...

Starting off you see your space ship. The magic word is [SPACE].
Go [N]orth to your control panel and just to get the magic message, [N]orth
again to receive a very important message. Sit your butt [D]own and [BLAST]
off for Fed Planet One.

Now get back [U]p, and let's jam [S]outh, [S]outh and [S]outh yet again to get
to the air-lock. [OPEN] the air-lock and go [S]outh to exit the Thruster. Go
[E]ast to the car, and [GET IN]. No controls, but it wants your credit card so
[GET CARD] out of your pocket and [INSERT CARD] into the slot. You
automatically go cruisin' to the Pink Flamingo Hotel where you go [S]outh
and [S]outh again to get to the hotel desk. As in real life, never pass up
free money so [GET COIN] and now we gotta pay the robot. [GET CARD] from your
pocket again and [GIVE CARD] to the robot. Go [W]est to the lift, and again,
since you want to go up, [GET CARD] from your pocket and [INSERT CARD] into
the lift device. You are in your room. Let's go to the bathroom first, so go
[E]ast and ... instant woman capsules? Gotta get one of these. [GET COIN] out
of your pocket (yeah, for such a studly dude, this guy goes digging around in
his pockets a lot) and [INSERT COIN] into the machine. [GET CAPSULE], and who
cares what that Sandie thinks. Go [W]est back to the bedroom, and
[TURN ON COMPUTER]. What do we want? Why, Lila of course, so tell 'em to
[SEND MAID] up to your room. She is, of course, impressed by you. Give her
what she wants so get [D]own on the bed and [MAKE LOVE] with her. Yup, it's
a dirty thankless job doing things this way, but someone has to do it. [ASK]
her for some information about the Tribe and she will spill her guts to ya.
Our job is finished here, so go [W]est, [S]outh, [S]outh, [U]p into the BT,
and [N], [N], [N] to our control panel. Sit [D]own again and [BLAST] off
for what's his face's space station.

When you arrive, get [U]p, [S]outh three times to get to the air-lock, [OPEN]
it, go [S]outh, [OPEN] the space station's airlock, and let's take a look
around. Go [W]est to the kitchen and [EAT CHERRY] since you're kind of hungry.
We want to find the guy who runs the place so [E]ast and [S]outh and you see
him. We want to [ASK] him about Mongo, but he won't tell you shit without
something in return so [GET CAPSULE] from your pocket and [GIVE CAPSULE] to
the horny bastard. He gives you the navagational code to the next place and
like magic you're back at your controls. Sit [D]own and [BLAST] to Mongo.

Get [U]p again, [S]outh three times to the air-lock, [OPEN], and step out
[S]outh to take a look at Mongo. Yeah, very clever hills. Go any direction
twice (let's say [N]orth, [N]orth) and, uh oh, it's the goon squad. A bunch
of blue chicks wanna see what you're made of so [UNDRESS] for 'em. They toss
you in prison with She-La who will help you escape, for a price. Get [D]own
and with her and [FUCK SHE-LA]'s brains out. Exhausting, but you must go on so
[ASK] her how to escape. You get booted down a shaft and end up in some sort of
lab. Go [E]ast and, hey, lookie here, it's a Sex-Ray. [PRESS GREEN] button to
turn that sucker on. [PRESS RED] to make it fuck up. Now go [W]est and [W]est
again to where you got two of the amazon guards waiting there to capture you
again. They take you to La-Lust, and maybe this shows up better on VGA, but she
looks like a shapeless yellow blob with too much eyeliner. Still, screw up your
courage and get [D]own onto her bed and [MAKE LOVE] to her. Yeah, pretty
impressive, but she wants to show you the Sex-Ray in action, so do anything at
all really (like [N]orth). Ha, joke is on her. You wanna blow this fiesta
before it destructs all around you, so [E]ast outta there. Whoops, looks like
our only hope is one of those Sky Bikes so [RIDE BIKE] back to your ship, go
[U]p into the Big Thruster. You're at the control panel. Sit [D]own a final
time, and [BLAST] off that hellhole and you have won the game. Hit a
directional key to see your prize and then Ctrl-S if ya want to see the 'hey
dude, you won' text. Lame, huh?

Some other points of interest (and ways to die).

First and formost, hit Ctrl-S when you enter a room or when something happens
to see Sandie's reaction. Sometimes helpful, sometimes not.

Blast off standing up. (Wonder how She-La survived at the end?)

[KILL SANDIE]. Didn't need that bitch anyway. Alternately, [KISS] her at the
control panel, [MAKE LOVE], [RUB TITS], [RUB SNATCH], [JACK], ya know, the
usual sex stuff. You can also use this sort of stuff with the other ladies you
encounter.

Break their hearts... When you get [D]own with a woman, immediately get back
[U]p. oooOOOOooo... Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, eh?

Piss of the guy in the space station... [EAT EGG] and die of food poisoning.
[PICK UP EGG] or [PICK UP CHERRY] from the galley and watch him blow his top.
Of course, if you're feeling a little light footed, [KISS] him. You can also
make the mistake of going to [SLEEP] in the barracks or even in your own bed.

If you don't [EAT CHERRY], you will die when you try and make love with
She-La. You can also die if you try to do anything to the guards they don't
like, such as running away, fighting 'em, or trying to grab anything
belonging to LaLust that you shouldn't. You will also die if you forget to
fix up the Sex-Ray.

Did I bother playing through this solve to make sure that it worked exactly?
Well, no, but it should be pretty close.

ECSTATICA SOLVE (Home made, use at your own risc)

Tip. * Don't try to kill the warewolf. You can't :)
     * Save often since warious creatures tend to sneak up
       on you and kill you in one sec.


START.
Enter the shop and back out as soon as the warewolf has spotted you.
When outside let him hit you once (that enables you to run) then run
into the ally behind the shop. Turn left (where else) and run until
you see a door to the left. Enter and pick up the sword NOT THE ARMOUR!
Kill the piggys (or the red dragon) and get out of there.


MAKE POTION.
Now get back to the church and pick up the little woodo doll lyin under
the dead priest. Walk out of the church and turn left, run into the
other alley. There in the corner you will find a closed door. Open it
and kill the bear inside, then run up the stairs two floors. There
you will find a fromula, read it then put the doll into the cooking pot.

Go down one floor and read the book. Then pick up the teddy and run to
the stable (where the little girl is seen in the beginning). Give her
the teddy and follow her to the church. Pick up the bible and follow
her down the stairs. When you have been down the dungeons.

Now go back to the second alley, don't enter the door but turn right
and go into the garden. Turn right at the cross and run up to the
monestary. Knock on the door, when the door is open go back and pick
up the flower. Put it in the pot aswell. Now go back to the first
alley (behind the shop) there there is a closed door, open it and
enter. Rescue the man.


SHOP.
Listen to the man then walk towards the door, the warewolf will kick
it down, to avoid being killed jump into the barrel! When he has left
go to the shelf and pick up the thingy there (only one is needed).
Put it inte pot!


POTION IS READY.
Drink the potion then go to the church down the stairs and enter the
hole. Walk along until you get big again. Then just run up the stairs
take the scared knights sword and go out the door.

Now go back to the cross and go right this time. Kill the minotaur
(if you haven't alredy) and keep on walking. When you get to the
lake walk to the flat stone and wait.....


BECOME A KNIGHT.
Turn back the same way you came and run straight on to the castle, Talk
to the old man. Enter the tower and run up the stairs, read the book.


DOWN IN THE TOWER.
Walk down the stairs ALL the way down. Sneak by the guard and walk on,
kill the two ghost fighters. Walk along to the stairs leading down.
Take the stairs to the LEFT on the screen. This part of the game is
really tricky. Save the game here befor you go down the stairs.
When you go down the stairs there are two traps on the way down and
to avoid them I simply walked backwards at the first and truned around
at the second facing forward again. Got it?


PASSED THE STAIRS.
Down here you simply cant die so try everything. But there are a few
things you should do

1. Talk to the king. (skeletton in trone)
2. Get the magic book (at the entrance to the demon)
3. Get the arour (in one of the mummy coffins)

when this is done get out of here, now run to the stone henge.


STONE HENGE.
Leave the book here and run back to the monestary. There you should
take the holy relic and run out thru the underground paths.
Go back to the stone henge put down your sword and pick up the
magic book. Place your self in the middle and pray ;).

Now you've got a real powerful relic to beat up the demon with.

FINAL FIGHT.
Go down the tower and enter the room with the demon (where you got
the magic book). Now go down the stairs and talk with the demon by
the table. Then when he's finished you could either:

A. Give him the relic.  Happy ending for you ;)
B. Kill him.            Happy ending for all...


Hope this works for you..  it did for me ;)

ITEMS THAT YOU AREN'T WEARING AND PUTS THEM IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE
YOUR BED. THEY ALSO AREN'T VISIBLE UNLESS YOU 'LOOK' OR GO OUT OF
THE ROOM AND RE-ENTER. F YOU FIND YOU'RE MISSING YOUR ACCESS

    NOW, THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IS THE LOWER ELEVATOR ACCESS
ARD. FLOYD HAS IT, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT FROM HIM IS TO BE
IN THE UPPER ELEVATOR WITH HIM AND KEEP SAYING 'SLIDE UPPER CARD

    YOU SHOULD NOW BE IN THE SHUTTLE. ALFIE CONTROL EAST, TO BE

THE OTHER ISLAND. THE SHUTTLE CONTROLS ARE VERY SIMPLE. THE LEVER
CONTINUALLY ACCELERATES THE SHUTTLE WHEN IN THE UP POSITION. IT
MAINTAINS CURRENT SPEED WHEN IN THE MIDDLE POSITION AND DE
CELERATES THE SHUTTLE WHEN IN THE DOWN POSITION. TO ACTIVATE THE
CONTROLS, INPUT: SLIDE SHUTTLE CARD THROUGH SLOT, DROP SHUTTLE
CARD, PUSH LEVER UP.

    OK, NOW KEEP HITTING 'L' AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOUR SPEED
INCREASING EACH TIME IN INCREMENTS OF 5. KEEP HITTING 'L' UNTIL
YOUR SPEED HIT 55 MPH. (NEVER MIND THE SIGN YOU SEE). THEN, 'PULL
LEVER DOWN'. IT WILL NOW BE IN THE MIDDLE POSITION AND YOU WILL
BE STEADY AT 55 MPH. SOON YOU WILL SEE A SIGN MARKING  THE
HALFWAY POINT. WHEN YOU SEE IT, HIT 'L' ONE MORE TIME, THEN INPUT
'PULL LEVER DOWN'. THE SHUTTLE WILL DECELERATE (IGNORE THE SPEED
LIMIT SIGNS) AND SHOULD STOP RIGHT WHEN  YOU'VE ENTERED THE
LAWANDA STAION! (THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD TIME TO SAVE THE GAME!).


    OK, NOW TO FINISH FIXING THE REST OF THE SYSTEMS AND FINISH
THE GAME. NOT E>>> SOMETIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE GAME
(DEPENDING UPON HOW LONG IT TOOK FLOYD TO GIVE YOU THE LOWER
CARD), YOU WILL GET  HUNGRY. WHEN YOU DO, JUST 'DRINK LIQUID' AND
DISCARD THE CANTEEN. O.K., FROM ALFIE CONTROL EAST GO: W,N,U

    COURSE CONTROL IS FIXED! NOW GO: S,S,S,S.

    YOU SHOULD NOW BE IN THE COMPUTER ROOM. YOU MUST NOW WAIT

 SORCERIAN
   Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 Due to the unique manner in which SORCERIAN is presented, this walkthru will be
a guide to finding your way through the various quests. After you've solved each
quest, before exiting back to the menu screen, take the time to travel back
through the quests' landscapes to locate hidden goodies -- items which won't be
discovered until after the quest is over.

 CREATING CHARACTERS

 You can create up to ten characters, but most parties may only consist of up to
four characters; several quests only allow three characters to participate.

 Generally, fighting characters (fighters and dwarves) have low (or minus)
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-11019

intelligence, but high strength and vitality; magical characters (wizards and
elves) have high intelligence but low (or minus) strength and vitality. At
various points in the quests, these attributes become important: High vitality
is required to open doors in the later quests; intelligence is needed to use the
magic in the items you will acquire; karma is important when talking to the NPCs
you'll meet, getting better prices, and for dealing with the priest in the
temple on the "Go to Town" menu. Other important stats are dexterity,
protection, magic protection (the ability to escape magical traps), and age.
And, as is true in most games of this type, male characters have higher strength
and vitality than females, but the ladies have higher karma and intelligence.

 So, give your character a name, select their class (fighter, dwarf, elf, or
wizard), their sex, and press ENTER to see what point bonus you get. Fighters
and dwarves get relatively high bonus points, while wizards and elves get lower
bonuses; females get lower bonuses than males, regardless of class. If you get a
bonus lower than five points, you might want to consider deleting the character
and trying again. Additional bonus points can be gained by raising the
character's starting age. You receive one additional point for increasing the
age of fighters, dwarves, and wizards by two years; elves' ages increase in
increments of five years per point.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11022


 Spread the bonus points around your characters' stats. Strength, dexterity, and
intelligence are the best ones to add to at the beginning; the other stats will
go up with experience, training, worship, and magic item acquisition.

 OCCUPATIONS

 This gets rather tricky. The occupations carry stat bonuses and penalties with
them. For example, some occupations may lower your character's strength but
increase his intelligence. Refer to the SORPRO.HLP file in LIBrary 9 -- CRPGs --
in The Gamers' Forum for a list of occupations, bonuses, penalties, and
earnings. There are four occupations which carry no point penalties (Farmer,
Florist, Housekeeper, and Cook). If you don't change your characters'
occupations, they'll all be Farmers. One of the quests requires that certain
occupations be included in the party. These will be noted at the beginning of
the quest.

 When you view the Occupations Menu, only those jobs printed in gold can be
selected by the character; occupations printed in purple cannot be selected; the
character's current occupation will be printed in white. The gold coins paid per
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11024

year will be listed at the top of the screen, and this will change as you move
the cursor to the different jobs. Note: Karma will affect the annual pay of your
characters; the higher the karma, the higher the pay.

 GOING TO TOWN

 After you've generated at least four characters, save them, and go into town.
Take each character to the weapons shop for outfitting; if they're not fully
equipped, they can't go on quests. That's all you need to do in town at the very
beginning. After you've been through the first quest, you'll do much more here.
The following paragraphs explain the functions of the various town locations:

 WEAPONS SHOP: In addition to buying weapons and armor, you can sell items and
potions: Don't! The prices you'll get are ridiculously low. Instead, sell them
after a quest is over (on the "end of quest" menu) to get fantastically high
prices.

 MAGICIAN: Come here to enchant items, retrieve those already enchanted, remove
enchantments from items, and to resurrect the dead (it's cheaper than the
temple, and karma's not a factor). Item enchantment takes three years to
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11026

complete and costs vary. Remember that you can only add one god's influence to
an item per enchantment request. So, if you want to create a sword with two Mars
influences, you'll have to enchant it twice -- that's six years. (Refer to the
MAGIC.SOR file in LIBrary 9 -- CRPGs -- in the Gamers' Forum for explicit
details.)

 HERBALIST: You can buy potions here, or you can have the herbalist mix the
herbs you've found in the quests. Note that all the potions listed in the
documentation aren't available; refer to it when you're having herbs mixed to
get those not for sale.

 While I'm talking about the herbs and potion mixtures, I'll touch briefly on
the creation of potions by characters skilled in Herbs. As mentioned, not all
the potions listed in the documentation can be purchased; some need to be mixed
by the herbalist. On the quests, you'll find the five different herbs which
combine to create potions. Refer to the documentation to have the herbalist mix
a potion he doesn't carry from your list of herbs. Once you have that potion,
the game will automatically "clone" it if the character possessing the potion
has Herb Knowledge and if the proper herbs are in _any_ character's possession.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11028

 To summarize: If your Herb Knowledge character has a potion of Cure and a
potion of Anti-Magic, and if the party's carrying five Verbenas and two Savorys,
the Cure potion (Verbena) could be cast six times, or the Anti-Magic (Verbena
and Savory) and Cure (Verbena) potions could be cast three times each. It's a
bit tricky and requires a close check of your herb/potion inventory, but you'll
get the hang of it as you go along.

 TEMPLE: While seemingly unimportant, a visit to the temple is necessary after
each quest to keep your karma high and to keep you in the gods' good graces.
Donate gold and make a confession to raise the negative karma of a character.
Only do this once a year, though. Praying after each quest is equally important;
doing so lets the gods know you're worthy of their intercession -- essential if
you need to resurrect a fallen hero. Only use the resurrect feature in the
temple if the magician isn't guaranteeing a 100% rate of success, or if his
price is beyond your means.

 ELDER'S HOUSE: Until you have a character trained in Item Knowledge, bring
items you find in quests here to be identified. The elder will charge for his
services, but it's money well spent. In addition, he'll tell you various legends
about which combination of gods create which spells; be sure to answer YES when
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11030

he offers to tell you the legends. He'll only tell you a legend after he's
identified one of your items. It's a good idea to make notes of what influences
your items have for future reference. If an especially powerful spell is on an
item, he'll charge you to "turn on" the magic spell. Again, the prices for this
service will vary.

 THRONE ROOM: This is where you come to gain level and stat increases after a
quest. These will be automatically bestowed if you're ready to go up a level.
The king will also tell you how many points are required to gain your next
increase. Be sure to bring both your participating and non-participating
characters here; even inactive characters will gain experience during their year
of occupational duty.

 TRAINING FIELD: Bring your characters here for training. Training takes two
years to complete regardless of the skill in which you're being trained. After
the first quest, the best skills to train your characters in are Item Knowledge,
Trap Escapes, and Herb Knowledge. The other skills are equally important, but
get several quests "under your belt" before you spend the two years to learn
them.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11069

 MUSICIAN'S GUILD: I'm still not certain what this place does, but it's free,
and the music's pretty if you have a music card in your computer.

 After all your characters have been to town this first time, save them, create
a party, and you're ready for your first quest!

 THE QUESTS

 In order to avoid repetitious directions, I've given names to each of the rooms
you'll visit in the various quests. I'll give you detailed instructions to reach
the room the first time; afterward, I'll refer to it by name only (e.g., "Go
back to the Throne Room"). At the end of the quests, I'll give you a list of
special items I was able to locate which aren't listed on the "Items" pages at
the beginning of the quest descriptions in the SORCERIAN documentation.
Consequently, I'll mention those items which are listed in the documentation,
but which I couldn't locate.

 FIGHT THE DRAGON

 When your heroes are experienced enough, after you've organized a party, you'll
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11071

be given the option to Fight the Dragon. This quest is murderous; it doesn't
appear to be an actual quest, but more of a dragon-bashing expedition. I was not
able to complete that quest, but it looks pretty straightforward; just close
your eyes, cross your fingers, and pray.

 Now, on with the quests!

   Part 2

 THE STOLEN SCEPTER

 Put your fighters in the front, your magic user (if you have one) in the back,
and press your CAPS LOCK key so that you'll have your characters' hit and magic
points displayed at all times. Go to the right across the bridge (Ball Room),
jump, and get the blue ball. Go left, fall down into the chasm (don't worry
about falling; your characters won't ever take hit points from falls), and go
all the way right to the hole.

 Go through the hole (Demon Room), right, and insert the blue ball in the hole
next to the door to open it. Enter the door and fight the Bogards (Bogard Room).
The magic user's Wooden Cane has a fireball spell on it. Hold down the ENTER key
to use it. This is a good place to gain experience; if you position your party
just right, the Bogards can't reach them, but pile up in a nice, tight column,
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11074

making them easy pickings. Allow them to pile up so that your party can regain
their hit points. Then, fight them and make your way to the right to the Stone
Switch. Jump and touch the switch to enter the Rat Room. Don't jump in front of
any holes in the Rat Room which have rats (red eyes) in them unless you want to
fight the rat hordes which come forth when you do.

 Go left until you see a hole without rats (almost to the left wall), and enter
it (Water Jug Room). Go to the jug and jump twice to get it. Go right through
the door into the Bat Room. Dash to the right (hold the Shift and right-arrow
keys down) and go through the door (Two-Jug Room). Go through the left-hand door
first. Jump twice to put water in the jug (One-Jug Room) then, go through the
right-hand door (Skeleton Room). Dash right and enter the first door you come to
(Spike Room). Heal up, then dash across the spikes to the left wall to get the
first Crystal. Dash back to the right, heal, go through the door, and dash right
to the next door. Go through it (Bridge Room) and head right to the torch. Jump
up to reveal a hidden door in the Rat Room (directly below you). Then, continue
to the right, and go through the door. You're back in the Ball Room.

 Go back to the Rat Room, go right, and through the door. Go up the stairs,
through the door, and walk to the right to find the second Crystal. Then, walk
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11077

to the left hole, and enter it. Go back to the Rat Room and make your way to the
Two-Jug Room.

 Put one Crystal in the left jug and the other in the right jug. This has
drained a particularly nasty acid lake; take the Crystals from the jars. Go
through the right-hand door to the Acid-Drop Room. Go through the middle door
and dash right (even more bats!) to the stone switch. Jump up and touch it (you
won't get any flashing lights this time), race back, and jump up to get back
into the Acid-Drop Room. Go back through the left-hand door, and work your way
back to the Ball Room, then on to the Demon Room. Get the blue ball, exit the
room, then go left and through the door (3-Door Room).

 Dash all the way to the right (watch your head!), and go through the last door
into the Torch Room. Insert the ball in the niche, and enter the door (Acid Lake
Room). Go all the way to the right and leap over the last gap to the ledge. Go
to the statue and take the jewel. (Note: The trap won't affect your fighter
characters' ability to fight.) Go left and make your way back to the Demon Room.
(Don't forget to take the ball with you!)

 Heal completely, then insert the jewel in the Demon's hands to open the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11079

right-hand door. Kill the two hydras with your fighters' swords (fireballs won't
work on them) for 250 experience points (EPs), and go right to get some Savory.
Exit the Hydra Room, take the Jewel, open the left-hand door, and enter it. Go
back to the Acid-Drop Room, insert the jewel in this statue's hands, remove it,
and go back to the Acid-Lake Room. (Inserting the jewel in the second demon's
hands removes a stone trap blocking your progress under the statue in the
Acid-Lake Room.)

 Go all the way right, down into the gap, stop, and heal. Now, go all the way
right to the chest. Fight the Ouks, get the Scepter, Long Sword, and Sage. Then,
go back to the 3-Door Room. Enter the middle door (Goran's Room), go down the
stairs, and talk to Goran. Leave him, go left, and through the next door you
come to (Hole Room). Go all the way right and through the door at the top of the
stairs. You'll find yourself in the Spike Room. Unfortunately, it's still in
operation. Jump right and enter the Skeleton Room.

 Now that you've found the Scepter, all the monster activity has halted. Take
your time to stroll through the caverns, touching walls to find herbs. Go to the
Ball Room, then return to Goran's Room. He should be gone. Go to where he was
sitting to find Goran's Axe.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11086


 When you're ready to leave, go back to the Ball Room. Save your game, go to the
ledge's edge, and jump across the chasm. You want to get out with that blue
ball! If you fall down to the lower level, restore, and try again until you make
it. Go all the way left and the quest is over. Make sure you have the following
items in your inventory before exiting the quest: Long Sword, Scepter, Blue
Ball, two Crystals, Water Jug, Goran's Axe, and Jewel.

 Give the Scepter to the king for gold. Sell the crystals, jewel, and jug. Keep
the Long Sword and Goran's Axe (use the DIVIDE option on the menu), and the Blue
Ball (it has a resurrect spell on it). Sell the short sword of the fighter who
receives the Sword and/or Axe (press the right-arrow key to get to your
characters' items for selling purposes). Disband the party, go to town to
convert herbs into potions, to visit the king for stat increases, for training
(if you wish), and to pray at the temple. In addition to gaining experience
through battles, training will net you experience. Be sure to visit the king
after training in case you've gained a level.

 Repeat the Lost Scepter quest until each of your fighters has a Long Sword,
your magic user (if you have one) has a Blue Ball and a Scepter (you only need
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11089

to give it to the king once; refuse the second time you complete the quest), and
each of your characters has at least 600 hit points. Train one character in
Items, another in Herbs, and a third in Traps before starting the next quest.

 HINT: While training is in progress, item enchantment should be done if you
want. That way, instead of having to play through three years' worth of quests
before an item's ready, you only have to wait one additional year after
training's completed.

 THE LOST TALISMAN

 Lots of traps in this quest; put your character with Trap Knowledge in the lead
before examining anything!

 Battle your way right and through the hole in the hedge (Left Hedge Room).
Then, go all the way right and stand under the cross. You hear the voice of the
Forest God who tells you what you must do and gives you the Golden Pedestal.
Head back to the Left Hedge Room, then go right, and up the stairs (Hill Top
Room). Wait at the top until the Hill Giants reach you. Do battle with them
until you win. Go right to receive the Emerald Ring.
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11095


 Go downstairs to the right (Well Room), go left, and through the hole in the
hedge (Sap Room). Jump over and get the Jar of Sap. Exit back to the Well Room,
and go through the wooden door into the Statue Room. The statue's trapped.
Examine it twice to open the stone slab, then heal before entering the opening
(Destru's Room). Equip your fighters with the Long Swords (if you haven't done
so already), your magic user with the Crystal Ring (it has the Heal spell on
it), and do battle with Destru. HINT: Destru is putty in the hands of a Long
Sword-wielding dwarf! Hold down the Spacebar, stay close to where his balls of
light coalesce, and beat on him until you win. (Press the ENTER key when you
need to heal your characters. Note that use of the Crystal Ring uses magic
points; magic points regenerate quickly.) After the battle, you receive Destru's
Diamond Staff which will get you through most of the doors.

 Heal and go through the right-hand door to the Purple Worm Room. Go left to the
door just before the ornate statue and use the Emerald Ring to open it. Enter
the room and examine the mediating man twice. After he tells you what a terrible
thing you've done, go back to the Purple Worm Room, jump over the worms, go all
the way left, heal, and go through the hole into the Chronodemon Room. Dash down
the hill, and left to the stone slab. Examine it twice, then go through the door
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11098

to its right. Now, examine the niche twice. When the sand starts pouring
through, exit this room, cross over the ex-slab, and go through the door into
the Niche Room.

 Enter the open niche, and go right though the door into Ria's Room. Talk to her
and do as she bids. Go left, upstairs, through the door into the Well Bottom
Room. Then, go all the way right, jump onto the rope, and climb it. As you do,
you drop the pedestal (it can't be helped). You're back in the Well Room. Go
right, upstairs, and examine the door until it opens. Enter it to find Ria's
uncle. Talk to him, and after he leaves, go back to the Well Room, and down into
the water. Walk right to learn you can't find the pedestal. Exit the well (don't
go back up the rope!), and you find wet footprints leading left. Follow them and
a hidden door is revealed to you.

 Go through it, down the stairs, and through the door. You're back in the Purple
Worm Room. Return to the Chronodemon Room, go left up the hill through the door,
up and through the next door, then stop and heal. Fight the Sand Maribo to earn
500 EPs. HINT: Stand on the lower stairs to the left of its lair, and make it
have to go to the bottom of the stairs to _your_ left. Hold both the Spacebar
and the up-arrow keys down continuously. Eventually, it will be impaled on your
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11109

swords.

 Go back to Ria's Room to report in. She tells you about a dungeon key dropped
nearby. Make your way back to the Well Room, go right, and through the hole in
the hedge to the 3-Door Room. Go through the middle door, jump down, through the
door, and talk to the guard. Go left past the door to get the Dungeon Key, then
through the door you just passed into the Ceiling Trap Room. After Ria opens the
door for you, dash left into Ria's Room, heal, and talk to her again. Return to
the Purple Worm Room (via the secret door in the Well Bottom Room), dash right
to the top of the hill (you'll see more footprints leading that way), and use
the Dungeon Key to open the door. Enter the Dungeon Room, go down, and talk to
Ria's Uncle. He gives you the Shrine Key, but won't come with you.

 Leave him, and return to the Purple Worm Room. Go left and through the first
door you come to. When you take the Golden Pedestal, the door closes. Put the
Dungeon Key on the altar in its place to reopen the door, then leave. Go back to
Destru's Room, and enter the left-hand door (with the Shrine Key). Get the
Talisman, return to the 3-Door Room, and go through the right-hand door. Walk
all the way to the bottomless swamp. You'll automatically throw the Talisman
into the swamp. The Forest God rewards you with 500 EPs, and the quest is at an

end.

 Wander around the scenery, bumping into walls to find herbs, and climbing down
into the water in the Well Bottom Room to find the Fog Robe. Before leaving the
quest, you should have the following items in your inventory: Emerald Ring,
Diamond Staff, Shrine Key, and Fog Robe. Be sure to identify these items (use
APPRAISE on the "end of quest" menu). Sell the Key, and DIVIDE the remaining
items to your magic user. Make the decision of whether you want to keep the Fog
Robe or the standard Robe of Protection (which your magic user currently has).

You'll come back here two more times for white powder. The powder is used to
extinguish flames that are hiding one of the five swords you'll need in order to
solve this quest.

 Leave this room and head right. Go through the first door; as you go down the
stairs, touch the third lamp to learn about messages hidden in other lamps. Go
through the door at the bottom of the steps into the 3-Door Room, then through
the door to your right. Touch the extinguished lamp (second lamp down the
stairs) twice to remove a blockage in the Rod Room. Go back upstairs and through
the far left door. Fight your way across the bridge and go through the door.
Touch the second lamp down the stairs to get another clue.

 Heal up and go through the door at the bottom of the stairs. Save your game,
enter the water, and kill the two Kraken for 2,000 EPs. Exit the water (left),
then leap from island to island (above the lake) to get the Gabriel Sword (on
the fourth island). There's sage on the fifth island, and savory on the seventh.
There's nothing else further to the right. On the way out of this room, go to
the left wall to get lavender.

 Go upstairs, through the door, then hurry across the bridge (try to avoid the
mud being thrown by the Golems above you), and go to the wall to find lavender.
Enter the left door. After the battle with the Lizardmen, touch the second and
fifth lamps for clues. (You've already found the sword above the lake.) Now,
have your strongest character push the fourth rod to stop the waterfall. Leave
the room, go back across the bridge, and go through the far left door.

 Fight your way across the bridge to the third hole and enter it. Throw the
white powder on the flame to find the Rafael Sword. Exit, go back to the left,
across the bridge, through the door, up, and through the center door. Go up,
through the door, and all the way left back to the Powder Room for more white
powder. Exit, and go all the way right, past the door, and up the narrow crawl

space. Examine the sword you find (it matches the Rafael Sword) again, to place
the Rafael Sword over it and open the door.

 Fight your way downstairs and through the door to another door with a sword
next to it. This sword matches the Gabriel Sword. Open and enter this door, then
examine the extinguished lamp on the staircase. When you do, you hear the sound
of something moving overhead. That's all you can do here for now. So, go back
upstairs, retrieving your sword as you go. Ah! A hidden door has been revealed;
go through it. Strange place, this, but it's sort of like one of those "slide
the block" puzzles. If you have CAPS LOCK on, turn it off so you can see the
entire room.

 It looks like you can only go a short distance, but if you stomp on the block
without a blinking light (press down-arrow), you'll see it will go down one
"square" for each stomp. Note the reaction of the other blocks in the room! Stop
three times to uncover the Silver Sword. Jump up the "stepping stones," go left,
and stomp on the first blinking stone to lower it. Now, you can exit the room.
Leave this area (up), and head all the way right to find lavender. (Remember to
take the Rafael Sword before you go back downstairs!)

 Go back down to the main level, left, and through the door. Cross the bridge
and go through the far right door. Go upstairs (Troll Room), fight the trolls
(they looked like mummies to me), and put the Silver and Gabriel Swords in the
empty niche to open the door. Go through and throw powder on the fire. Return to
the Powder Room, get more white powder, and return to the Troll Room. Throw the
second handful of powder on the fire to find the Michael Sword. Take it, exit
the room, get your Silver and Gabriel Swords from the niche, and go back to the
3-Door Room.

 Go through the right door, all the way left, and place the Michael Sword in the
niche. Go through the door into another of those sliding-block puzzle rooms.
Turn off your CAPS LOCK key to see the entire room. Stomp the first non-blinking
block, then stomp on the second non-blinker. Go to the left, down the stepping
stones to the bottom, right to the wall, and push up on the non-blinker to
reveal the Crystal Sword. Go up, over, and down to get the Sword.

 To exit this room, go back down the center set of stepping stones, go left, and
push up on the far left blinker. Go up through the center steps, back to the
door, and exit. Take the Michael Sword from the niche, go all the way to the
left wall for some sage, then exit back to the 3-Door Room.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11863


 Go through the middle door, up, and right. Go up the narrow crawl space, place
the sword to open the door, then go through the door, and use the swords to open
the other doors barring your progress. Work your way through the doors in this
manner until you come to Lucifer's Floodgate. Place the Silver Sword on the left
and the Crystal Sword on the right to open the gate.

 Take the Silver and Crystal Swords and exit, collecting your other swords as
you go. Now that the Floodgate is open, the monsters are quiet. Explore all
areas before leaving. Before ending the quest, make sure you have the following
items in your inventory: Rafael (6 Mars, 4 Saturn), Michael (7 Mars, 3 Saturn),
Gabriel (8 Mars, 2 Saturn), Crystal (6 Jupiter, 8 Sun), and Silver (7 Sun, 7
Venus) swords.

 THE CURSED OASIS

 Go to your right through the opening into the Desert of Pillars. Battle your
way across the desert to the opening and enter it. You wind up inside a well.
Don't wait around long, but exit the well to the left to find sage, then go
right into the tunnel. Go through the tunnel to the Castle's front, and through

the door.

 Start fighting immediately to get through the Berserkers. Wade through the
fountain (left), and go through the door on the lower level. You can't help the
girl yet, so go under her and through the door, across the screen, through the
other door, and down the stairs to your left to the Kitchen. Talk to Olvara;
don't go near her fire or you'll get a nasty burn.

 Go back upstairs, exit this entire area, fight the Berserkers, and go up to the
door on the upper level. Go through it, upstairs, and out the door to the
Walkway Room. On this long walkway is a number of doors. The first one leads to
the Upper Winch Room; the second leads to the Lower Winch Room. These winches
need to be turned to free the girl. Unfortunately, they're rusted tight; you'll
need oil to loosen them.

 Before entering the third door, heal. This door leads to a swamp which houses a
suspicious-looking dragon fountain, complete with statue. Wait around long
enough and both the dragon and statue come to life. Vanquish Ruwan and his
Golden Dragon for 1,500 EPs. That's all there is in this room; you'll never need
to come back. Go back to the Walkway Room and enter the fourth door.

 Go downstairs and through the door into the Piston Room. Avoid the "pistons,"
and make your way to the lower left-hand corner into the well. Go down to the
Ocula Room. These things are quite nasty. The free-floating pillars (baskets)
control the gates which lead to the other sections in the room. To use them, get
behind the pillar and stomp. If you can catch the oculas in the gates, that will
kill them; otherwise, just beat on them. Work your way through the room to the
upper left-hand corner, and go through the door into the Oil Room. (Don't go
through any of the lower openings, yet.)

 In the Oil Room, dash to the shelves; examine the jars which are the second
from the left to get the oil. Go back through the Ocula Room and make your way
back to the Walkway Room. Go to the Upper Winch Room and oil the winch connected
to the rope. Go back to the Oil Room for more oil, go to the Lower Winch Room,
and oil that winch. As you do, the winch begins to turn. While you're in this
area, return to the Oil Room for more oil; you'll need to oil two more times
before the quest ends.

 Return to the Kitchen (via the lower-level door in the Berserker yard) and talk
to Olvara to receive her thanks and a gift for freeing Riala. Heal, then go

right, and go through the door (under the stairs). Be very careful with these
poisonous snakes; if your characters become poisoned, they'll never heal (unless
you have a Cure potion with you).

 When you're past the snakes, enter the center door, fight the Berserkers, then
examine the jar. It's trapped, so be sure the front character has Trap
Knowledge. Examine the jar until you hear sliding block sounds, and you find
Savory. Leave (fight more snakes), and go through the right door. Cross the
walk, go through the door, and fight more snakes. Go through the center door
(even _more_ snakes!), and perform the same examination on this jar as you did
on the other. This time, you'll find Sage.

 Go back through the left-hand doors until you get back to the Kitchen, and go
back to the Walkway Room (via the upper-level door in the Berserker yard). Go
all the way left and you'll see the stones of the wall have moved inward,
opening up an alcove. When you enter the alcove, you'll see a jar. Upon
examination, you learn it's Holy Water.

 Go back to the Kitchen and talk to Olvara. She tells you to take it to Riala
who's at the Oasis (where the quest began). Leave the Castle (right), the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-11878

Courtyard (left), through the tunnel and Sandworms into the well (left), and
cross the Desert of Pillars (left) back to the Oasis. Give Riala the Holy Water.
When see looks at it, she tells you it's hydrochloric acid and gives it back to
you. Go back to the Kitchen and talk to Olvara again.

 She tells you to go back to the Oasis for some herbs which you are to bring to
her. Do so (Riala has the herbs). Olvara takes the herbs and tells you about a
magic barrier Ruwan has setup around the Oasis, and that burning the herbs
should remove it. This time, the "Oasis" being referred to is not the one where
Riala is, but is beyond where you found the acid.

 Go back to the Walkway Room, and walk to the far left. You'll see another set
of stones has moved inward (this is the barrier to which Olvara referred), and a
door within a room beyond the Alcove has been revealed. Go through the door, and
you'll be in the upper level of the Oil Room. Continue left and you're told a
wall with a keyhole blocks your way and that there are wedges at the top and
bottom of the door. Yes, back to Olvara, who tells you Ruwan hid the key in the
Desert of Pillars. Leaver her and go back to the Desert of Pillars. Go to the
tallest pillar (second to the left of the castle in the background). When you
examine it, you automatically pour the acid on the pillar, which dissolves into

a key.

 Go back to the Walkway Room, and go left to the wall. However, when you use the
key, the wall still won't open; must be those wedges! Go back to the Ocula Room.
Now open and close the gates until you can go through the right-hand exit at the
bottom. Go down and over through the door. Fight snakes, then go to the jar. You
will oil and turn it as you examine it. Doing this removes one of the wedges.
Leave and go back to the Oil Room, get more oil, then return to the Ocula Room.
This time, open and close the gates until you can go through the left-hand exit
at the bottom. Go down and over through the door, fight the Berserkers, then oil
this jar to remove the second wedge. Return to the upper level of the Oil Room.

 This time when you approach the wall (left), it will be gone. Continue left to
find real Holy Water. Then, return to the Oasis, and give the water to Riala to
end the quest. Be sure to examine the entire area before leaving.

way up, and through the door. Go upstairs and through the second door. Go
upstairs and through the door. Go all the way to the right, through the door,

wine. (You'll need to fill the jug two more times.)

 Exit the Wine Room (left and up), then go right, through the door, and up. Go
through the door, upstairs, left, and through the second door. Go upstairs,
through the door, right, and through the door. Go upstairs, left, through the
second door, up, and through the left-hand door into the Key Room. Hanging on a
pillar to the left of the man is a gray key (it's difficult to see); however, he
won't let you near it. Get him drunk; give him the wine. He asks for more, so
don't delay! Return to the Wine Room, fill the jug, and come back to the Key
Room. Give the man the second jug. It's still not enough, and he demands more!
Make one last wine run, and give him the third jug. That does the trick; after
he's asleep, get the key and leave this room (forever).

 Go through the right door into the 3-Door Room, right, and through the middle
door (there are three on this walkway) into Zorak's Room. In this room, talk the
man (Zorak...but he's really not; you'll learn this later on). Leave his room
and go right through the last door. Fight your way upstairs and through the
door. You have one more battle. When you go through the door, stay there; all
the thieves will congregate on the left side of the walkway. When you're ready,
go upstairs and fight your way through the right-hand door into the Elevator
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11894

Room. Talk to Oram. He won't let you ride...yet! Go back to Zorak's Room and
talk to him again. Return to Oram; this time he let's you ride.

 A word about the elevator. As it moves (up only), jump to the left or right to
access the various tower levels. Make sure your speed is relatively slow (3 or
higher) to make the jumps easier. If you miss, step off the elevator, fall down
a level, and try again.

 Get on the elevator and exit left just above the Elevator Room (you should
still see Oram on your screen). Fight the thief to gain his Pass. Leave his room
and just step to the right off the ledge. Don't get back on the elevator. Fall
down to the main level, go through the door, then through the left-hand door.
Show the guard your pass, through the left door, upstairs, and through the door
to the Ball Room. Embedded in the left pillar are red and blue balls. Take the
blue ball (you can't take both) and leave. Go back to the Elevator Room, ride up
one level, and exit to the left. Go through the door, downstairs, all the way
left, and down. These two jugs contain save, verbena, and lavender. Go up and
back to the Elevator.

 Now, it gets a little tricky. Jump on, then off to exit to the lower of the two
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11896

right-hand levels. Go all the way right, and talk to Kuore. He gives you a clue
about Zorak's odd behavior. Leave Kuore, get on the Elevator, and ride up one
more level. Exit to the lower of the two right-hand levels. Go right, upstairs,
and open the door with the blue ball. Enter and head right. You've found
Princess Zeyna, but she's afraid of you and won't talk. Leave her, return to the
Ball Room, replace the blue ball, and take the red. Leave (right, down, right),
and go through the door (on the guard's level).

 Go down, through the door, and down. Go through the door, all the way right,
and through the door. Go down, through the door, and left (you'll fall to the
next level down). Go through the door, left, through the door, down, and through
the door. Go left (you'll fall to the next level down again), through the door,
and down. Go through the door, down, left, and through the door. Go down,
through the door, right, and open the gate with the red ball.

 Go over and talk to the Baron. After he dies, leave, take the red ball, and
return to the Ball Room. Replace the red ball, take the blue, and go back to
Princess Zeyna's Room. This time, she talks to you (because you've been to see
the Baron), and she gives you the Pendant. Suddenly, into the room comes Zorak!
(But is he really?) Before you can react, the floor opens beneath your feet and
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11906

you find yourself falling.

 Down, down you plunge into the strange realm beneath the Tower into a
subterranean lake (Lake Room). Leave the lake (left), and go through the
opening. Continue all the way left through the last hole, then left again
through the opening. Go right, through the hole, and down. A fierce Shadow
Dragon awaits you! Whack it with your swords for 2,000 EPs, then go left, up,
and through the hole.

 Go over to this contraption, stand on the right-hand block, and stomp to make
the upper block rise. (You'll find out why, soon.) Leave here, go all the way
right, and down into the water (watch out for the killer Gar!). Take the right
fork (not the downward one), down at the next intersection, exit the water, and
go left. Go through the hole, then right down into another of the lake's
tributaries. This water is either acidic or poisonous because your characters
start losing hit points. Dash down, right, and up to Zorak's Island and his
final resting place. Examine his bones and you learn of his door puzzle: "From
where the sun sets, one land, three skies coming together opens the door."

 Here on his island is another of those contraptions (like the one the Shadow
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11911

Dragon was guarding). Stand on each of the blocks and stop to make each of the
upper platforms rise. Return to Zorak's bones to find the Mark. (The "one land"
refers to the left-hand stone block in the other room remaining down; the "three
skies" refers to the other blocks being raised to the "skies.")

 Exit the island to the right (more poisonous water), dash down, right, and up
to the last room in the door puzzle. (If you didn't put the platforms in the
proper order, you would have been stopped by the currents from getting here.)

 The "shelf" in this room is useless. Stand on the lower block and stop to raise
the upper platform. Now, let's go find out what we've opened up. Go back to the
Island, exit to the left, dash down, left, up, and out. Go up and through the
hole, right, and down into the water. Go down, left, up, and left at the fork.
Go down at the intersection, left, down, left, and up. You'll automatically
float to the top.

 Exit the water, go through the door at the top, all the way left, up, and talk
to the Wizard. Even though you've solved the puzzle, he demands the Pass. Give
it to him (you'll get another from Kuore). Enter the water and follow it until
you're sucked upward and spat out into the wine fountain (whew!).

 Go back to the Elevator Room and ride it back to Kuore's Room (up one level and
off at the first right). Talk to him and he'll give you another Pass. (Be sure
to tell him you'll help!) Leave his room and make your way to the Chapel Room
where you found the jug on the altar. You'll find a guard's been posted here.
Show him your new pass and go left into the Chapel. Inside, it appears a
wedding's in progress. When you approach the couple, you learn the false Zorak
is about to marry Zeyna. The chapel becomes dark, and the Princess and Zorak
disappear. Talk to the remaining man in the chapel, the leave.

 Go back to the Elevator Room and take it to the top level. Go up, through the
door, up, through the door, and left through the upper door. Go all the way left
to the Widow's Walk where you find Zorak and Zeyna. Talk to him, and he finally
reveals himself as a Major Demon, and demands that you give him the Pendant.
Suddenly, he transforms from Zorak into his true appearance, and begins to
assault you with magic. Leave and go back to Kuore's Room. Kuore tells you the
only thing which will defeat the demon is the Garateen, a holy sword carved with
sacred runes, and that it comes from Zorak's and Zeyna's home country. The
Garateen can be found in the underground on Zorak's Island.

 To return to the underground, go to the right-hand level just above Kuore's
Room via the Elevator, go through, and through the door. Talk to the sleeper.
After he finishes, walk to the right wall. When you touch it, it pushes away
revealing a passage. Walk all the way right, and you'll find a breach in the
floor. Jump into the gap and you'll be back underground.

 (Note: If you play through this quest a second time and have the Garateen sword
in your inventory, you will not need to return to Zorak's Island to get another
one unless you want to get a second (or third!) to give to your other fighters.)

 After you have the Garateen, return to the Widow's Walk to do battle with the
demon. The best strategy is to stand still, jump in place continuously, and use
the Spacebar to fight. After the battle, talk to Zeyna, give her the Pendant,
and get 2,000 EPs. Return to the lower level of the Tower and exit left to end
the quest. Before leaving make sure you have the Garateen in your possession.

 Go all the way right as far as you can. Pass the trees and the door to reach
the Old Castle Ruins. Continue right until you see an odd pillar which appears
to be hanging suspended and attached to another pillar. When you see it, jump on

 Put your Fortune-teller in the lead, leave, go up the hill (right) and into the
water. Jump on the blocks in this order: center, left, and right. Go down the
hill and left into the hole. Talk to the man who opens the door to Lili's Room
for you. Enter, go down, right, up the ladder, back to the left, and talk to
Lili. After you purify the water, she gives you the Golden Key. Put your Doctor
back in front, and leave by going all the way right, through the wall, and up
the well. Jump right at the top of the well to exit.

 Continue right and enter the white building. Talk to the man who gives you Tree
Medicine. Leave and go right across the bridge. With the exception of Vadis and
his underground creatures, you won't kill anything; when you hit something, it
changes (briefly) back to human form, and bounces away.

 Head right and go into the first opening (not a door) you see. Go down the
ladder, all the way left, and up the left-most ladder. Go to the pig and talk to
it. It takes the Tree Medicine and reverts back to Prince Frederick. He gives
you the Scroll. That's all you need down here. Go through the door. Go all the
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-11960

way right, down the hill, and turn left. Walk to the wall. It crumbles at the
touch of the Wise Man's Cane. Go left and into the hole. Go right to the red
gate. The Golden Key shines on the gate, and it opens to reveal Bibi, Lili's
sister. After she leaves, exit this cave and return to Lili's Room.

 Lili tells you to come back to her after you talk to the people at the Temple.
So, leave and go back to the Temple (all the way left back into the town area).
When the priest sees you have Lili's Key, he gives you the Hermit's Robe. Go
back to Lili who will enchant the robe for you.

 Leave and go all the way right as far as you can. Jump over the volcano for
now, go to the wall to find some hyssop, then enter the door. Talk to the King.
When he sees the robe you have with you, the madness leaves him, and he tells
you where Serina is. The citizens he enchanted are once again themselves.

 Go right, through the door, down the ladder, and all the way right to find some
lavender. Then, go up the ladder, fight your way to the wall, and touch it with
the scroll. At its touch, the wall collapses. Go right, down the ladder, and
left through the hole. Go down and all the way to right to the gate. As you
reach it, the door opens, and Serina steps forth. (Note that Serina will join
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12331

your party, has hit points, and items in her possession. Don't get her killed
off!) Take her back to the King, then take her back into town to the Castle
where her father waits. He gives you gold and EPs, and Serina gives you her
necklace. The father tells you about the cane being used to build bridges, and
about a fabulous sword called Dragonslayer.

 Leave Serina and her father, and go back to talk to the King. He tells you
where Vadis is. Leave him, go right, and jump into the volcano. Because you have
the robe, you survive the lava's heat. Travel down, right, and up out of the
lava.

 Go down the stairs and right into the chasm (don't talk to the man, yet). At
the bottom, jump right and go to the wall to find some savory. Go left across
the lava, take the stairs to the "stone pipe," and go down. Talk to the man who
gives you the Dragonslayer sword. Go up the pipe, go right, and up the pipe
(just left of the lava).

 Now, go talk to the man and let him transform the cane into a bridge. Put your
characters with the highest hit points at the front and back; sandwich the
character with the lowest hit points in between them. Heal completely, and if
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12333

you have a magic user with a Heal spell, turn it on!

 Jump, go across the bridge (right), and battle Vadis. The strategy to beat
Vadis is to hit its last end-section. As Dragonslayer hits an end, it dissolves.
Keep hitting until it's completely gone. Go right to find some savory, then go
back to the man and get the cane back. Return to the King for your end-of-quest
reward.

 Before ending the quest, you should have the following items in your inventory:
Wise Man's Cane (3 Jupiter, 4 Mercury, 1 Venus), Hermit's Robe (4 Jupiter, 2
Saturn, 2 Moon, 1 Venus), Golden Key, Scroll, Necklace (2 Jupiter, 2 Sun, 2
Moon, 2 Venus), Dragonslayer, and the Sacred Shield (6 Jupiter, 2 Moon). Note: I
was never able to locate the Potion of Longevity mentioned in the documentation.

 RIDDLE OF THE RED JEWEL

 Before organizing your party for this quest, I strongly suggest you have a lot
of Cure potions or a magically-charged item with the Cure spell on it. There are
several extremely poisonous insects and snakes in this adventure. Also, during
the quest, do not look for the hidden herbs while you're playing. Instead,
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12335

search for them after you've found and healed the Red Jewel. There is a lot of
arcade action in this adventure involving the "dash-jump" maneuver. When I refer
to it, hold down the shift key and the up-arrow key at the same time to jump off
the logs. I will tell you which direction (left or right) to move after the jump
has been executed.

 Go right, up the stairs, all the way right, and enter the hole in the tree.
Now, go left, up, and to the left edge of the log (do not go through the hole
yet). Save your game, dash-jump to the left, and try to land in the bird's nest
below you (Nest Room). (If you miss, restore, and try again.) Now, dash-jump
from the Nest Room to the right, to land on the unconnected log where the hut
is. Enter the hut and talk to the person inside to receive the Fairy Tears.

 Exit the hut, go right, upstairs, and insert the Tears in the pipe (it looks
like a periscope) to make the Elves' Bridge solid. Go right, dash-jump right,
cross the bridge to the right, and retrieve the Tears from the pipe. Go right
through the tree hole, left, and up the blue "elevator" (Elevator Room) to the
level above the inaccessible hut.

 Go left, up the stairs to the Dark Elves Room, and go right. Insert Tears,
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12337

cross the bridge, enter the hut to learn about the scales, leave, and go through
the tree hole. Dash-jump to the left across the bridge, upstairs, and through
the tree hole at the left to the Scales Room. You can't do anything with the
scales just yet. Go up the left stairs, dash-jump to the right, and fall down
past the two right-hand logs back to the Dark Elves Room. Go downstairs (left)
to the left edge of the log. Dash-jump to the right, then immediately change
direction to the left to land on the level with a door and a hut directly below
it.

 Heal completely, go left, and enter the door. Kill the silkworms, then leave.
Go left, and dash-jump right to the next level down. If you miss the log, go
through the tree hole to get back there. Now, go through the previously closed
door, and talk to Teto to get the letter. Leave the hut, go all the way right,
and jump down to ground level. Go all the way right, up the stairs, and "stomp"
on the fifth step to go down into that grassy-looking strip.

 Go right and talk to the person guarding the machinery. When he sees the
letter, he lets you go to the lever. Go right and touch the lever to turn off
the blue "elevator." Leave the Machinery Room, go all the way back left, up, all
the way right through the hole, left, through the hole, right across the bridge,
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12340

down, right, and jump-dash over the missing bridge.

 Go through the hole and left into the hut. Talk to the person to learn about
the location of additional Tears (birds' nests), then leave. Go to the left edge
of the log and fall straight down. Go into the hut and approach the person.
You'll automatically be shooed out and deposited outside a tree hole. Go back to
the Nest Room, get the Tears you find, and go back to the Machinery Room to turn
the elevator back on.

 Go back to the Dark Elves Room, right to the middle of the bridge, and enter
the hole in the foliage (about midway across the bridge). Talk to the person who
tells you how to get the Jewel. Leave and go to the Scales Room. Heal
completely, then enter the right-hand door. Kill the moth (jump on the tallest
of those pistoning logs), heal up, and leave. As you leave the room, the
left-hand weight lowers. Enter the left-hand door and get the Red Jewel.

 Return to the Dark Elves Room, go to the edge of the log at the bottom of the
stairs (left), dash-jump to the right, then fall straight down through the
bridge at the right to land on the log with the hut, and enter it. This time,
when you approach the person, he opens the door to the Sacred Fountain room for
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-12342

you. Enter the room, go down, and enter the water. When you do, the Red Jewel is
healed and turns yellow.

 Leave this hut and head all the way left to end the quest. Reminder: Search for
the herbs. The ones I found were all on the ground level and were all detected
by jumping while moving left and right. Before ending the quest, make sure you
have the following in your inventory: Fairy Tears, Letter, and the Yellow Jewel.
Give the Jewel to the King if you want, or divide it to your magic user, and
have the Town Elder turn on the spell it contains: Become Air.

 THE DARK MAGICIAN

 You are limited to three party members in this quest, but you don't have to
include special occupations (see "The Dragon King").

 Go right from the Main Room and go through the door. Go downstairs, and through
the door. Dash right, go through the door into the Demon Room, go right, and
through this door. Now, go all the way right to where the trail dips downward.
Stand directly over the supporting pillar (directly below you), and go up to
enter the hidden door.

 Walk over to the front of the first blue grate and search to find the Dungeon
Keys. Enter this blue grate and search in the upper-left corner of the room for
another hidden door. Enter it and take the Moon Stone. Go through the left door,
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-12345

up, and through the door back to the upper level of the Main Room. Go left, jump
down, go all the way right, and enter the door into the Pedestal Room. Place the
Moon Stone on the right holder.

 Leave the Pedestal Room, go left, and through the door back to the Demon Room.
Go right, through the door, and this time, go all the way right across the
bridge. Jump to the upper level, enter the door at the right end, and go through
the left-hand blue grate to find Orsa. Talk to him, and he will join your party.
Immediately equip his Saint's Robe.

 Leave his cell and go right through the second blue grate. This cell only
contains a clue about the Gold Pillars (not those in the Demon Room, though), as
does the other cell (next to the one where you found the hidden door). Exit the
Dungeon Area (for good) and return to the Pedestal Room.

 Orsa knows spells of teleportation which involve the Moon and Star Stones. So,
stand in the stone arch (between the pedestals) to travel to the Garbug Room.
Dash right across the lava, enter the door, and take the Star Stone. Go through
the right door, stand between the pillars, and "stomp." Now, you can exit the
area via the right door or go back to the Pedestal Room the same way you got
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12348

here; for now, go through the right door, head left, and go into the Giant
Snakes Room. Dash left, through the door, and enter the Column of Light Room.

 Stand in the light to rise to the top, then step off to the right. (Note: If
you bump your head at the top of the Column, you'll loose HPs.) The door at the
top returns you to the left side of the Demon Room. Return to the Main Room
(right and through the door), and go back to the Pedestal Room.

 Place the Star Stone in the empty holder, heal completely, and enter the stone
arch once more. Go right (you can use the "islands" if you want), and as you
pass the third island, the Blue Dragon attacks! Try to get onto one of the
islands, jump in place, and stab at it with your swords. After the battle, go
right to get the Steel Sword, then return to the Pedestal Room. Take the Moon
Stone, enter the arch, and touch the loose stone to lower the pillars. Go left
to find savory, then return to the Pedestal Room. Replace the Moon Stone, take
the Star Stone, and enter the arch.

 Dash across the lava, enter the door, and return to the Demon Room. (After
lowering the two pillars, you can't get back to the Demon Room via the Main
Room.) Hm, some alterations have been made since your last visit. Go up the
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12350

stairs, enter the door, and go right to find the Sun Stone. (Read the tablet on
the way. It contains a clue about how to exit after the quest is over.)

 Return to the Demon Room, go right, and through the door. Go across the bridge,
and through the door at the right end of the lower level. Go down, through the
door, and battle your way to the door at the right. Heal, enter the door, and
confront Ghedis (he's easy with Orsa's help). After Orsa leaves, go back and
search for herbs in the cavern walls, then return to the upper level to the
right of the bridge. Go to the low point and exit through the hidden door. Enter
the first cell, go through the door in there, go left, up, left, and down to the
Main Room. Before leaving take: Star Stone, Moon Stone, Sun Stone, Dungeon Keys,
and Steel Sword. (8 Mars, 1 Jupiter, 6 Sun, 2 Venus: It has the Sun Ray spell on
it; have the Elder activate it.)

 THE CURSED SHIP

 Another three-member limitation in this quest. Make sure you have a character
with at least 20 Vitality.

 Enter the ship (through the door) and talk to the Captain to learn what's
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12352

happening. We'll take care of getting Joshua off the ship, first. Go all the way
left, down the hatch, downstairs into the Upper Crew Level, and left through the
door. This is Lucas's Room. Talk to him, leave, go left through the gap in the
bulkhead and to go left through the door. This is Jeremiah's Room. Talk to him,
leave, go back right through the bulkhead, all the way right, and through the
door on the lower level at the far right side.

 Go down and through the door to the Lower Crew Level. Go left, down the ladder,
left, down the next ladder, and left into Jacob's Room. Go to the desk, read the
diary, and get the Hatchway Key. Leave Jacob's Room, go right, up the ladder,
and work your way left to the upper level of the Lower Crew Level. The last of
the rooms you need to visit is Ezekiel's. The door to his room has a barrel on
either side of it. Talk to him, then exit Ezekiel's Room and return to the Main
Deck (topside).

 Go to the middle mast and climb it to the very top. Night should occur
immediately; if it doesn't, you missed one of the crew's rooms. Return to all
four rooms to make sure you've hit them all before you go back up to the top of
the middle mast. As soon as night falls, go to the left side of the mast's top
cross-beam to receive a light from St. Elmo's Fire. (It doesn't show up in your
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12354

inventory, but it does seem to make your characters glow with light.) After you
receive the light, go back down to the Main Deck, then make your way back down
to the door which leads into Jacob's Room.

 Go all the way right, up the ladder, and through the door to your left. Go
down, through the door into Door Room One. Work your way down to the lowest
level and go right. Climb up and over to the top right side and continue right
into Door Room Two. Go right down, over to the door, and enter it. Go up,
through the door, and into the Aft Room. Go up, through the door on the middle
level, and all the way left to talk to Joshua. Go back to the Aft Room, up, and
through the door on the top level at the left into the Two Barrel Room (so named
because there are two barrels here that may be examined). Go down, left through
the door into the Ghostly Room. (I haven't found anything which will protect you
from the ghosts, yet.)

 Climb to the upper left-hand exit and go left. In the next room, go through the
lowest level's exit to the left, and continue on the lower level to the left
until you reach the Macaw's Room (watch the rats!). Go up to the bird. As you
make a grab for it, it flies away. Return to the Main Deck, climb the mast at
the far right, and dash-jump left to the middle mast's cross-beam to get the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-12357

Macaw.

 Return to the Aft Room and take the bird to Joshua. He decides he should go
ashore and joins your party. Return to the Main Deck, go talk to the Captain;
then, take Joshua ashore, and return to the ship. Tell the Captain you'll help
solve the murder. Now, go back and visit all the crew's rooms again. Lucas's
will be locked, but you'll find him loitering outside Jeremiah's door.
Jeremiah's not feeling just right, and Ezekiel's lost his axe. After leaving
Ezekiel's Room, return to the Main Deck, and climb the middle mast to the top
again. You find Jeremiah's on watch.

 Now, go back down to the Lower Crew Level, and enter Jacob's Room to catch
Lucas snooping. When he leaves, return to the Upper Crew Level, go to the right,
and down to the lowest level in this area. Enter the door on the left which was
previously locked: This is your party's room. When you enter the room, you
should hear a sound. Leave the room, and return to the Two Barrel Room where you
find Ezekiel waiting. Talk to him, then return to Door Room One where you find
Jeremiah, dead, and take his Desk Key.

 Working your way all the way left via the upper levels, go to the Hidden Door
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-12359

Room. Go to and examine the one barrel sitting atop a crate to find the secret
door. Enter it, and fight all the rats while working your way up and right to
the bloody axe. Take it, then return to Jeremiah's body, go through the door,
and return to Ezekiel's Room. Talk to him, leave, and go to Jeremiah's Room. Go
to his desk and read his diary.

 Return to the Main Deck and talk to the Captain. Tell him you found the killer
(keep answering "Yes") until he tells you to return to your room. Go down the
first hatch you see (left), down the stairs, left, and through the door into
your quarters. As you enter the room, the ship sets sail, shakes, and you find
yourself tossed ashore on a grassy island. Go right to the shrine. Continue
right where you find Lucas who warns you to leave. Head all the way left where
you find Lucas once more. He's badly hurt; talk to him, take his Cabin Key, and
return to the ship (through the hole in the hedges). Go to Lucas's room and
search his desk to find an Auger. Take it and return to the Two Barrel Room. On
your way, you find a bloody, dying Ezekiel. Talk to him to learn what he saw.
After he dies, continue to the Two Barrel Room. Go to the top left-hand barrel
and examine it to get the Holy Water.

 Return to where the "Captain" waits and confront him. After you sprinkle the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-12361

Holy Water on him, he regains his senses, but you hear something evil calling
from the island. Go back to the island, head right, and do battle with the
Archdemon. He looks nasty, but he's easy. After the battle, return to the
Captain and talk to him. He thanks you, then asks if you'll climb up the mast to
see why the sail won't open. Climb the left mast and jump on the cross-beam to
free the sail. Climb down, go right, and you find the Golden Bottle. Return to
the Captain, exit the ship, and go left to end the quest.

 Note: Nothing you find in this quest can be divided among your characters, not
even the Golden Bottle (it has four charges of every god on it). So, give it to
the King for 1,000 extra EPs (or sell it for 145 gold pieces). Also, I found no
herbs in this quest.

 GARDEN OF THE GODS

 This quest is limited to three characters. Go right and enter the first door
(Wine Shop). Talk to the merchant, then leave. Enter the next shop (General
Store) and talk to this man. Exit, continue right, and enter the next door. It's
an empty house, but the right wall has verbena. Leave, enter the last door to
the right and take the Red Seed in the right corner.

 Exit, go all the way right (past the temple; you can't do anything here, yet),
go up the hill, and through the hole (Blue Mountains). Don't stand around too
long, but dash right and through the hole (Black Mountains). This is another
place in which you don't want to tarry. Dash all the way right, go through the
hole, and approach the gatekeeper. As you do, he tells you that you can't go any
closer because you're mortals. But he seems to be thirsty. If you could find
Press <CR> for more !





CompuServe CIS:TEG-12365

some wine....

 Go all the way left back to the Wine Shop and talk to the merchant. Luckily, he
found a bottle of wine. Take it and go back to the gatekeeper. Now that his
thirst is quenched, he lets you through the gate. Stand in the sparkling curtain
and ascend to the porch. Don't stand here too long or you'll be hit by the
shooting stars. Go right, through the portal, and continue right into Zeus's
Chambers. When he sees you, he growls about uninvited guests, summons a
whirlwind, and tosses you out.

 Go left to the Black Mountains. As you go, you drop the Red Seed. Leave to the
right, then come back; the seed has sprouted. Do this once more, and soon, a
vine worthy of climbing rises before you. Climb the vine up to the first porch,
exit to the left, and go visit Dionysus. He, too, seems thirsty, and asks that
you bring him a tribute the next time you visit him. Return to the vine and
climb up to the next two porches. Exit to the right (leave the left for later),
enter the door, and talk to Hephaestos. He sends you on an errand to Apollo.

 Go back to the vine, climb up to the last two porches, and exit to the left
(leave the right for later) to visit Apollo. When he learns that Hephaestos sent
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12368

you, he gives you the Seed of Flame, then asks a favor: to find out what
Aphrodite (whom he loves) wants. Go back to Hephaestos and give him the Seed of
Flame. He rewards you with a bottle of his Golden Wine. Take the wine and return
to Dionysus. He takes the wine and tells you that Aphrodite longs for the red
fruit which grows on the vine.

 Go to the vine, climb down, and get the red fruit. Go back to Apollo and give
him the fruit. He gives you some gold and tells you how Zeus might be appeased.
Now, go see Aphrodite (on the right side of this level). She tells you about the
harp and needing someone to play it. Go back to the vine, climb down one level,
and exit to the left. Go all the way left and you find Anna. Talk to her and she
joins your party. Return to Aphrodite. When you tell her about Anna, you get the
harp.

 Return to the vine, go back down to the ground level, and return to Zeus. Anna
immediately begins to play. Talk to Zeus to receive his thanks. He tells you
about Adana stealing his Bracelet, which is what had angered him so.

 Go back to the General Store and talk to the man. Then, go to the Wine Shop and
speak to the wine merchant. Suddenly, the wine merchant disappears, and in his
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12370

place is the Shrine Maiden, Adana! She transports you to the top of a mountain
and attacks you. Go to the tallest peak to kill her. When you do, Zeus's
Bracelet falls into your hand. After you've retrieved the bracelet, you find
yourself back in the Wine Shop. Talk to the merchant for 10 gold coins. Go to
the General Store for another 10 gold coins.

 Now, exit, go right, and enter the Temple. It's too dark for you to see, but
gradually, your eyes become accustomed to the darkness, and you see a bag of 100
gold coins in the right corner.

 At this point, the quest can be ended. You have the option of returning the
bracelet to Zeus for 200 gold coins and 50 EPs; or, you can take it with you (it
contains the Barrier Spell). In the Blue Mountains, you should find a Shield
with 4 Jupiter enchantments (in a ravine just to the right of the door). There's
also hyssop growing in these mountains. Search the flowerpots on the gods'
porches for verbena. After you've explored, exit the quest by going all the way
left.

 THE CAVERNS OF ICE

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12372

 Enter the door in the facade into the Icicle Room, go right, and through the
door into the First Polar Room. Go through the left door, down, and through the
door into the Second Polar Room. Go through the right door into the Angel Room,
and through the door at the bottom of the stairs into the Cell. Talk to both
prisoners for clues to the puzzles Sukoram has placed on the doors. Return to
the Second Polar Room, go through the left door, down, and enter the Lever Room.
You'll see something twinkling on the pillar above the door. Go up and get the
Lever.

 Now, go all the way left to the pile of bones to get a clue about the doors in
the Lettered Doors Room: "C thrice...B twice...A once." Return to the Angel Room
and get the letter "A." Then, return to the Icicle Room, dash all the way left,
and enter the door into the Hell Room. Go to the first "L" and replace it with
the "A" to "heal hell." Go back to the First Polar Room, go through the right
door, down, and into the Demon Room. Fight the killer snakes and go left. Enter
the water, do down, around, and up to the God Room. Exit the water, go left,
through the door, down, and enter the door into the Lettered Doors Room.

 Go left and enter the "C" door; go right and enter "C"; go right and enter "C."
Now, go right until you loop back to the "B" door, and enter it; go left and
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12374

enter "B" once more. Finally, go right, and enter the "A" door. You should be in
the Refrigerant Room. (If you're not, go back through the door, and try again.)
Walk to the pipe going into the ground and use the Lever to turn off the gas
fueling the refrigeration unit. Exit, then go back through the same door ("A"),
and return to the Demon Room.

 Go back to the Icicle Room and go right. You'll see three frozen waterfalls.
Use them as stepping stones to get to the upper level and go through the door.
Go down and enter the Evoke Room. Jump up and touch the "V" to open a secret
door (don't enter it yet!) Go through the right door into the Blast Room and
talk to Kahzeh. To free him you'll need to change the "Blast" to "Bless."

 Go back to the Evoke Room, take the last "E" from the word, return to the Blast
Room, and place the "E" where the "A" is. Now, go right, through the door, and
battle Sokuram. You'll need to use the waterfalls to rise high enough to kill
him (he's the one with the hammer and lightning bolts). After the battle, go
right, and take the letter "S" from the word. Return to the Blast Room and place
the "S" where the "T" is to free Kahzeh from his prison. As a reward, you
receive the Tears of Wind from him.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12376

 Go right and through the door into Ekim's Room. He's easy to beat. After you
do, the quest is over. Return to the Demon Room, enter the water, and search the
walls for the Shield. Then, return to the bones in the Lever Room to find the
Armor. Return to the Icicle Room, exit through the middle door, and go left to
end the quest. The Armor has 9 Jupiters; the Shield has 6 Jupiters and 2 Suns.
Give the Tears of Wind to the king for 400 extra EPs.

 THE CURSE OF MEDUSA

 This quest is limited to three characters. Go right and enter each of the three
houses. The first has a fireplace, the second is empty, and the third has herbs
stored in the right-hand cupboard. At the end of the quest, the fireplace in the
first house will contain a valuable treasure.

 Exit the last house, go right past the stone people, continue right over the
bridge, and go down into the hole you find (it's a depression in the grass). Go
left until you see Medusa. Immediately, go right, take the Mirror Shield, and
continue right to the rope. Go up the rope, exit, and talk to Anna, who joins
your party. Go back to the stone people and examine the one standing by himself
to the left of the mine entrance. This is Anna's master; she takes the Antidote

CompuServe CIS:TEG-12378

from him.

 Now, go into the mine entrance, and go right until you see Medusa. Again, as
soon as you see her, go left and exit the mine. Go right, across the bridge, and
you should see a knothole in a tree. Enter the knothole and talk to all the
people you see down there. Exit, go right, and back down into the hole in the
ground. Go left, and this time when you see Medusa, dash-jump over her to get
into the newly opened mine tunnel. Go left to the jar and get the Blue Cord.

 Go back to the right, dash-jump over Medusa again, and continue right, up the
rope, and out. Go right to where the stones are piled around the tree on the
riverbank, and throw the Blue Cord into the water to get your weapons' power
increased. You're now ready to battle Medusa.

 Go back down into the mine, find Medusa, and kill her. After the battle, go all
the way left to exit the mine, and talk to the girl standing where Anna's master
was. She tells you that he's gone into the mountains to look for Anna. Go all
the way left as if to end the quest. As you do, Anna will leave your party.
Continue left; suddenly, Medusa's live head comes flying at you! To kill her
once and for all, stand in place (do not jump), face left, and attack with your
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-12381

swords. When she finally dies, her head is severed, turned to stone, and dropped
at your feet. You take the head automatically.

 Return to the mine where you fought Medusa, go all the way right to the rope,
and search the right-hand wall for the Armor. Go up the rope, jump to the left
(into the bushes on the next screen), and get the Laurel Rod. Finally, exit the
mine, go all the way left, and enter the house with the fireplace. Search the
fireplace to find the Ring of Power. Exit all the way left to end the quest.
Give Medusa's Head to the king, sell the Mirror Shield, and equip your party
with the Armor (contains the Resurrect Spell, 10 Jupiters, 2 Suns, and 2
Venuses), the Ring of Power (contains the Turn Spell, 7 Jupiters, 6 Suns, and 1
Moon), and the Laurel Rod (contains the Bolt Spell, 1 Mars, 3 Jupiters, 1 Sun,
and 7 Mercuries).

 THE MISSING MAGICIAN

 Go right through the spinning stone columns and all the way right to the wall
to find lavender. Then, go through the opening into the Machine Room. Go through
the right door into the Lava Pool Room and go across the moving ledges to the
other side. Turn and face back to the left to see something glittering. Dash
left across the lava to get the Flame Crystal. Dash back to the right, all the
way right, and down into Stairwell One (there are a lot of these, so keep them
straight). Go down and enter the stone tube. Go down into the Harpy Room, dash
left, and enter the door. Go left and examine the globe to learn how to stop its
spinning; there's hyssop in the right wall.

 Exit this room, return to the stone doorway in the Lava Pool Room, and get the
Red Gemstone. Go back to the Harpy Room, go all the way right, down the tube to
Press <CR> for more !





CompuServe CIS:TEG-12384

Stairwell Two, down, and down into the tube to the Fireball Room. Go left,
insert the Red Gemstone into the square niche to open the grate, and dash left
to the doorway into the Amoeba Room. Go right, down to Stairwell Three, down,
and down through the tube into the Ogre Room. Go left, down the tube to
Stairwell Four, down, and down the tube to Kaji's Room. Go right and talk to
her. Insert the Flame Crystal to release her. She gives you advice on defeating
Haiko, and the Energy Rod.

 Go back up to the Ogre Room, right, and touch the gate. Go right to the central
globe and examine it. As you do, a force draws you into the globe and deposits
you in a different room. Work your way down to and take the Morning Star (lower
right). The writing on the wall tells you the weapon will destroy something.

 Return to Kaji's Room, get the Flame Crystal, and dash right, up, and through
the door into Haiko's Room. Start attacking the flames shooting up from the
floor. The more you extinguish, the lower Haiko will come. You must get him down
to the highest level your party can jump before you can destroy him. After the
battle, go right to find Chain Mail.

 Return to the Machine Room (all the way back up to the top level) and hit the
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12387

globe with the Morning Star to destroy it. Now, return to the Harpy Room, go
left over the bouncing columns, enter the opening, and destroy this globe. When
you do, the door out closes; you must destroy the two bouncing balls in order to
reopen the door.

 Go back to the Fireball Room, dash left to the other grate, and insert the
Flame Crystal to open it. Go all the way left, up the tube to Stairwell Five,
and up to the Missing Magician's Room. Go up to him to learn what the quest was
really about. After he returns you to the surface, you may want to go back to
get the Red Gemstone and Flame Crystal (Fireball Room), or to search for herbs.
To end the quest, return to the Machine Room, go through the left door, and
continue left.

 Sell the Crystal and Gem, divide the Mail and Morning Star to your fighters,
and give the Energy Rod to your magic user.

 THE WATER OF LIFE

 Before beginning this quest, I strongly advise that: You have at least three
Cure potions or an item enchanted with the Cure spell with you, and some means
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12388

of resurrecting your characters (they'll die several times); you put your magic
user somewhere in the middle of your party; you have a method to heal your
characters quickly. Also, expect to be attacked immediately upon entering just
about all the rooms in this quest (there are a few "safe" rooms).

 Dash right, leap to the upper ledge, and enter the hole. Go right to enter the
Pillar Demons Room. The tactic that worked best for me was to stand in place and
jump while I used the Spacebar to attack. When standing in front of the left
column, face left; face right in front of the right column. After the battle
(good for 2,000 EPs), go left, through the hole, down to the lower level, and
all the way right (stay on the lower level), through the hole into the Long
Room. Dash right, examine the hand to take it, and go left through the left-hand
hole into the Two Door Room. Jump down, go right, down, and through the hole
(you can't open these doors yet) into Heart Rome One. Go down and through the
door at the lower right into the Muscle Control Room. Touch the red spot next to
the muscle to activate it: This is an elevator of sorts you'll use elsewhere.
Every time you use it, you will need to come here to reactivate it.

 Return to Heart Room One, go left, up at the first opportunity, and through the
hole into Heart Room Two. Go right, through the hole into the Stomach Room, and
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12391

right, then left to the bottom level. Go through the left hole, over to the
right door, and through it into the Cask Room. Go to the cask and examine it to
get some advice and the Tuning Fork. Exit this room, go through the left hole to
get back to the Stomach Room, then back through the hole on the upper level to
get back to Heart Room Two.

 Go down to the lowest level of Heart Room Two and enter the door. Put the
Tuning Fork on the left stand; you should hear a loud sound. Go back to the
Stomach Room, go down, and through the hole on the right side into the Acid Lake
Room. Save your game before making another move, then jump from ledge to ledge
until you reach the door on the right side of the lake; enter it. Go up and
right to get the first of three Crystal Valves. There's savory on the ledge
above the crystal. Exit this room, save your game once more, and return to Heart
Room Two. Go down through the door and take the Tuning Fork.

 Go back to the right, get to the upper level of Heart Room Two, go left, and
through hole back to Heart Room One. Go down, left, up, and right through the
hole back to the Two Door Room. Go left and work your way back to the Long Room.
Dash right (talk to the rope where the hand was hanging for more cryptic clues),
and go through the hole into the Elevator Room. Jump onto the elevator, ride it
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12393

up, and jump off to the right. Go through the hole into the Cilia Room,
dash-jump right, and enter the Valve Control Room. (Stepping on the waving cilia
is what deactivates the elevator.) Insert the Crystal Valve into the right-hand
niche and return to Heart Room One (go right, through the square hole, left and
over the top of the elevator, down through the hole back to the Long Room, left
to the Two Door Room, and through the hole).

 Go to the Muscle Control Room and reactivate the elevator. Then, go back to
Heart Room One, left, and through the first hole you come to on the lower level
to Heart Room Four. Go down and through the door on the bottom right. Place the
Tuning Fork; you should hear an unclear sound. Exit this room, go left, up, and
through the top hole back to the Two Door Room. Go up and enter the right-hand
door to Crawler Room One. Go right, down, and through the hole to the Slug Room.
Go right, through the hole, get the second Crystal Valve, and return to the Two
Door Room.

 Now, go back to the Valve Control Room, remove the right-hand crystal, and
insert a crystal in the left-hand niche. Return to Heart Room One, reactivate
the elevator, then go back to Heart Room Four. Go down, right, through the door,
and get the Tuning Fork. Exit this room and go up to the left at your first
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-12396

opportunity back to Heart Room Two. Go right, down, and left on the middle level
(above the lowest level's door). Go left and through the hole into the Bivalve
Room. Go through the upper hole to Heart Room Three, all the way right, through
the door, and place the Tuning Fork; you should hear a clear sound.

 Exit the room, go all the way left, down, and through the hole into the Leech
Room. Dash down, left, up, left, and down. Go through the door into the Stone
Arch Room. Go left, upstairs, and through the door into Crawler Room Two. Go
right, get the last Crystal Valve, return to the Leech Room, and go back to
Heart Room Three. Go right, up, and right to retrieve your Tuning Fork. Then,
return to the Valve Control Room. Remove the left-hand crystal, and insert a
crystal into the middle niche.

 Return to the Long Room, and go through the new hole in its center. You see
some odd changes in the heart walls; passages once open are now closed.
Reactivate the elevator, go back to Heart Room One, then return to the Bivalve
Room. Go up through the hole, and all the way right to the door. Enter and place
the Tuning Fork; you should hear a clear sound. Go back to Heart Room Two,
right, and through the hole into the Stomach Room. Go down, left, and all the
way right through the hole into the Acid Lake Room. This time, you're going to

CompuServe CIS:TEG-12398

have to enter the acid. Jump down, dash-jump left (to get out of the acid as
quickly as possible), and enter the hole. You're back in the Leech Room at its
far right side. Go all the way left, through the door, and back to the Stone
Arch Room. Go through the arch, dash all the way right past the muscle, and go
through hole to get back to the Two Door Room.

 Now, you can enter the left-hand door. On the other side, you find another of
those muscle elevators. Ride it up, jump off to the right, and enter the hole.
You've found the Water of Life Room. Take the Water from the statue. At this
point, all the monsters have been deactivated with the exception of the cilia
and those pulsing yellowish spots; you'll still lose hit points when you touch
them. Return to the Valve Control Room and take the middle crystal. You'll need
to use the new hole connecting the Long Room and Heart Room One to get back
there.

 Now, return to the Two Door Room, back to the Stomach Room, and through the
lower left hole. Go through the door, down, and get the Potion from the Cask
Room. Return to Heart Room One, reactivate the elevator, then go back to the
Bivalve Room, up, and right to the door to retrieve your Tuning Fork. Now, go
back to the Long Room. Go through the right hole into the Elevator Room, and

CompuServe CIS:TEG-12401

ride it up to the Cilia Room. Dash-jump left, go through the hole, and head left
to end the quest.

 Give the Water of Life to the king for 2,000 extra EPs, sell the crystals and
the tuning fork, and divide the potion.

Space Quest II, Vohol's Revenge       -The Solution-
-----------------------------------------------------

You begin the game sweeping the outer decks of your space ship. As you are
doing your chores, you will hear a sound emitting from your watch. When this
happens, look at your watch and press the button marked 'C' on your watch. Your
superior will order you to clean the just-arrived spaceship. You may press the
other buttons marked 'H' and 'T', but you will not get points for them. They
tell you the [T]ime and your [H]oroscope. Now, press F10 to stop looking at the
watch. Now, walk up the walls (Yes, you can walk on the walls) and situate
yourself in the circle on the ceiling. You will be whisked away inside the
space ship. When inside the space quest, you will go through the process of
decontamination. It only takes a second or two. On the back wall, you will see
an empty hanger. Walk up to it and change your suit. Open your locker and take
the puzzle and the supporter. Now you're all set. Walk through the door on the
left wall.

One of the men will approach you and tell you get your ass over to the
space ship. On the base of the left wall, you will see a little platform. Walk
on the platform and it will carry you to the level above you. Walk in the small
opening in the tube and you will be whisked away to another room.Leave the tube
and enter the space ship. As you are disgusted by the smell of the space ship,
you are abducted by Vohol's men. Vohol will explain his plans to get revenge
from what happened to him in Space Quest I. After his long and winding speech,
he will board you on a spaceship destined to a nearby planet to perform labor
work in his mines. After landing on the planet, his men will attempt to escort
you to the mines, but the hovercraft runs out of fuel and crashes to the earth.
Luckily, you survive the crash, but Vohol's men encounter death, most likely
approaching the gates of hell. Search the dead body lying on the ground and
retrieve the keycard from him. Examine the wreckage and you will notice a
peculiar button. Press the button and the beeping from the hovercraft will
stop. It is advisable to watch out where you are walking around the crash
since there is a pit that you will fall into. Its located on the right hand
side of the screen. Make your way behind the large tree in the back of the
screen and move up. You will then appear in another part of the woods, however,
Vohol's men are on the lookout for you, so you must hide here. Hide behind one
of the bushes on the right hand side of the screen until you cannot see
yourself. Wait awhile until one of Vohol's men appears in a hovercraft
searching for you. If you in an adequate hiding place, the man will leave
and search for you in another place. Now, come out of your hiding place and go
to the bottom-right corner of the screen and go right. You will see a small
being tied to a rope. Being patriotic, you must untie him and he will run away
into the bush. Go to the bottom-left corner and go left. When you are back at
clearing with the two large trees (Where you were hiding), go left and approach
the top-left corner and go up. If you find the right path, you will see a huge
plant-like organism with some pulsating fuzzies in them middle of it. On the
other side of the plant is are some berries. Being careful not to touch ANY of
the roots of the plant, you must make your way through the roots until you make
it to the other side. Now, collect some berries, and make your way back through
the maze of roots. Now, go south again.

On the ground you will notice two small plants. If you kick them, you will die,
so be careful. Take one of the spores from the plants, and venture your way
east. Now, go up the platform ledge and go to the top of the screen then move
west. Then, you will see a mailbox. In your possession is a mail order form
for a magazine. Mail it and the mailbox will whirl, and then a whistle will
fall into the tray. Take the whistle and go east. When you get to the next
screen, go east again, and you will be prompted to insert disk #2. When you
find yourself on the shoreline of a swamp, rub the berries on your body. This
will deter the swamp slug from trying to eat you. Now, walk into the swamp.
When you get into the 2nd screen of the swamp, move towards the top of the
screen and you will eventually find a deep part of the swamp. When that
happens, hold your breath and swim under. You will be in an underground cavern,
and you must follow it until you find your way out the other end. At this end
is a glowing gem. Take the gem and enter the water again and hold your breath
again. Swim back to the swamp, and continue your journey east again. When you
reach the edge of a deep, deep cliff, you must then climb the dead tree
situated at the edge and it will crack and provide a bridge over the cliff.
Walk over the log and walk east again. As you are walking east in the woods,
you will be caught in a booby trap, and blood will rush to yer brain and you
may begin seeing things and dreaming about weird things, then when you wake up,
you will be in a cage with a beast watching the fire burn. What you have to do
is get the guard's attention. Try to talk to him several times, and when he
finally approaches your cage door and stops, throw the spores at him. The fumes
of the spores will kill him. Now, take the keys from him, unlock the door, and
then open it and take the rope from the boulder and make your way north.

You will end up on a small platform in the mountain side. In the distance you
will see the landing platform that you landed on when you arrived on the
planet. Quickly as possible, make your way west. If you are too slow, you
will be discovered and shot by Vohol's men. When you make it west, you will
be in the forest again. Walk west once more and you will be beside the cliff.
Climb onto the log and crawl half way across it. Now, tie the rope to the log
and climb down the rope. (Do not tie the rope to the stump). Down inside the
crack, you will see a large monster growling at you. Move your way down the
rope until your feet hit the bottom of the rope. Now, start swinging the rope.
The rope will swing faster and faster. When you notice the monster swing his
arm at you once, that is your cue to jump to the othe ledge. Don't let him
have a second chance to swing at you. You should make it to the other ledge.
You will be in a dark cave, so walk into the darkness as far as you can, and
then hold out the gem in your hand. It will give you a lot of illumination
inside the darkness. Make your way around the rocks and go all the way to the
end of the cave, until you fall down in a hole. When you fall out into an
opening surrounded by large boulders, some small men will appear and tell you
to follow them. Before you follow them, take the gem from the ground again.
(You dropped it when you fell). Now, follow them south. They will talk to you
thanking you for saving their friend's life, etc, etc and tell you you can stay
as long as you want, and just give the word when you want to leave. There is no
reason to stay there because you already picked up your gem again. Now, type
"Say the word" and they will provide you a means of exiting the place. Climb
down the ladder. You will be in total darkness! Now, to provide some light,
put the gem in your mouth and you will have some light. What you have to do is
find your way out of the underground cavern. Here is a partial map of how to
get out. It may not be exactly to scale, but it should suffice.

When you reach a beautiful underground waterfall and a lake, walk into the
water and work your way to follow the current of the water. When you approach
the stream where it forks of into two holes (caves), take the right cave. If
you take the left cave, you will meet your death by falling over a waterfall.
Take the right one! You will approach a whirlpool and get sucked up by it, but
you will not die. You will exit out into a small lake-like pond with an ugly
face carved in the mountain. A waterfall is spewing out of its mouth.
Move right and you will end up in a place where you cannot move anywhere. You
are surrounded by a large rock and trees. Just to be safe, stand in the water
and blow your whistle. A beast that looks somewhat like a tornado will
cut its way through the rock and try to kill you, but because you are in the
water, he will not touch you. What you have to do is throw the puzzle at him.
You must be quick to do this, or he will kill you. Stand on the ground, and
throw it at him and he will leave you alone. Now, walk into the hole the
beast carved for you in the rock.

You will now be outside of the platform where you arrived on when you came to
the planet. A guard will be patrolling the building, so be careful where you
walk, or you will be shot. When the guard looks out when standing in the
middle, and proceeds walking LEFT, then take off to the door and insert the
keycard into the door. If he is walking 'Right', he will see you and kill you.
Be quick! If you do it okay, you will end up on top of the platform and you
will see a spaceship. Walk to the rear of the ship and open the hatch. When at
the controls of the ship, press the "power" button, then turn the dial, and
press the thruster button, and pull back on your joystick (or hit the down-
arrow key on your key pad). You will begin rising. When you exit the atmosphere
of the planet, begin moving in the forward direction. Eventually, Vohol will
get you and take control of the ship, and guide you to his base inside a
very, very large meteor. It is now time to insert disk #3.

You will now be docked in Vohol's base, but oddly enough, you do not see any
guards. You are curious as to what Vohol as in store for you. Walkways are
extending in almost every direction. Take one of the paths going towards the
east or the west. Either way, you will find an elevator. Walk inside the
elevator and look around. You will notice a panel with buttons on it. The
buttons are labelled One, Three, Four, and Five. The second level is NOT
accessible from the elevators. Now, press "three" and you will be transported
to level three. As you walk along level 1, you will notice a door with a button
on it. This is the only thing I found interesting on this level. Push the
button and walk inside the door and take a look. It will be dark, but you will
notice that you are in a janitor's closet. In there is a plunger. Take the
plunger. On each end of the levels is an elevator. Make your way to any one of
the elevators and transport yourself to level four. On this level, you will
find a door. Push the button and inside the door you will find a glass cutter.
You obviously have to take it. As you continue on looking around level three,
you will find a bathroom. In the empty stall in the bathroom, take the toilet
paper and leave the bathroom. Make your way to an elevator and go to level
five. Up there you will find a door that contains a waste basket. Take the
waste basket. Also visible are a pair of overalls. Take the overalls and a
lighter will fall out. Take this also. Also on this level is a kissing
monster with red lips who will give you a juicy french kiss. I don't see any
significance to this love monster yet. On any of the levels, you may
see a floor-walker waxing the floors. Run away from it! If you don't, he
will flatten you and end yer' game. Now, go back down to level one in front
of your space ship. 

You will now see a path extending downwards. Walk down the path and you will
be trapped in between two barriers and the floor is moving slowly out from
underneath you. At the VERY last minute, stick your plunger to the barrier.
You will be safe. When the floor closes again, climb down from the plunger.
You will subsequently lose your plunger, but you do not need it. To the right
and the left are two exits. On both exits are some killer-robots. Before you
go in any direction, put the toilet paper inside the waste basket, then drop
the waste basket on the floor and light the paper. This will cause the heat-
sensitive sprinklers to go off on the ceiling short-circuiting the robots.
After your slick job has been completed, go right until you find yourself in
a room where Vohol is sitting on a platform looking at you. What you have to do
is walk up the stairs towards him. You will be shot by a laser-beam, but your
game is NOT over. You will eventually be minituarized and stored into a small
jar. Cut the jar with the glass cutters and you will see a vent to your left.
Climb inside the vent and push the button on the back wall. This will shut off
the life-support systems thus killing Vohol. Go back through the vents and
walk to your left. By now, you will see a keyboard, monitor, and a switch.
Walk up to the switch and pull it. Now, the screen will ask you if you want
to enlarge or reduce. You want to enlarge, so type enlarge on the keyboard
and go back inside the jar and you will be enlarged again. Search Vohol's
dead body and you will notice a password on him. This password is SHSR.
Look at the flashing screen and type in the password SHSR to abort the
launch of the clone-salesmen. Now, make yer' way up the second flight of
stairs.

You will now be outside of the meteor in some sort of tunnel. Beside you is
a box. Open the box and wear the oxygen mask found inside. Walk along the
tunnel until you find yourself inside the base again. You should save your
game now as its not hard to die. The sound of a blaring siren is ringing
through your ears. You must escape from the meteor-base right away.
Walk left and after two (2) screens, type "PUSH BUTTON", but don't hit
the return key. Walk one more screen left and when you see the robot standing
on the wall, as quick as you can push the button to open the pod door and
type "ENTER POD". This may take a few tries as you have to be extremely
quick as the robot can kill you very easy. When inside the pod, press the
launch button. Ahh! You have escaped from Vohol's base, but your problems
are not over yet!! Your oxygen supply is about to go empty, so you must
walk around the pod and find the chamber. Open it and climb inside.
You have saved the universe and the planets from certain destruction!
You are waiting for someone to find you... Soon!

  This game is a good one. It would be too bad if no one played it simply
because they couldn't figure out what to do with the dials on the surfboard.
So, I'm making life easier by typing all the dox up that look necessary in the
game. I distributed the Schedule with the release of the game, so there is only
the map remaining.

 SPELLCASTING 101: SORCERERS GET ALL THE GIRLS
                    Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 So, you want to be a sorcerer? You, Ernie Eaglebeak, sit in your drafty attic
room in the town of Port Gekko, dreaming of a life on the campus of Sorcerer
University. Classes (GIRLS!), lectures (PARTIES!), tests, fame, and fortune (not
to mention Lola Tigerbelly) await if only you can get away from the meanest
stepfather in Peloria: Joey Rottenwood. Fate has bigger plans in store for you
than you could ever imagine, however, as you travel through this pun-filled
adventure.

 NOTE: This walkthru will get you through the game in NICE mode. The encounters
in NAUGHTY mode are not that much different; I'm sure you'll be able to figure
out what to do. I found both modes enjoyable.

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15630

 ESCAPE!

 You begin the game in your attic room awaiting an unavoidable beating from your
stepfather. This time, you decide to make a break for it! But how? The door is
barred and you're a bit too high to just jump out. There are two ways out that I
know of, although I heard there's a third. Any way you go, you'll end up in the
same situation. The game starts at 3:35 p.m. Friday; each move takes 5 minutes,
and Joey Rottenwood is due to interrupt you at 4:00. So, either WAIT UNTIL 4:00,
or try fun stuff like EXAMINE ME or GET RAT.

 After Joey's visit, you realize escape is even more imperative because at 7:00,
a friend of Rottenwood's (he has friends?) is going to introduce you to the
wonderful world of dragon-tending. This will occupy you for the next seven
years, dashing your hopes of a career as a wizard (and ending the game). So, get
a move on, Eaglebeak!

 You don't need the application or love note in the writing desk, but read them
for laughs if you like, then get ready for your disgusting escape.

 Route one: OPEN LEFT WINDOW. OPEN RIGHT WINDOW. GET HAY. DROP HAY OUT RIGHT
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15632

WINDOW. JUMP OUT LEFT WINDOW.

 Route two: NORTH. OPEN TINY DOOR. GET POTTY. OPEN GRATE. DOWN. DROP POTTY. (You
really don't want to keep it, do you?)

 Both routes land you in the alley, filthy and naked, with your only way out
through the gate to the east; however, you can't go that way yet. Lola, the beat
of your heart, has caught her dress on the gate. You'd die of embarrassment if
she saw you in this state! To make things worse, Joey appears to "help" Lola.
But wait! There's a pair of overalls in the shed to the west.

 Unfortunately, the shed door is locked. Fortunately, the key is under the flat
rock nearby. Unfortunately, you can't get it. Try MOVE ROCK and GET KEY.

 Where'd that foot come from? It's attached to your old teacher, Miss
Beancounter, spinster. Lucky for you she's blind as a bat. But if you give her a
chance to find her spectacles, clean them, put them on, and get a GOOD look at
you, you're dead. What to do? Desperate times call for desperate measures. PUSH
BEANCOUNTER. GET KEY. UNLOCK SHED DOOR WITH KEY. OPEN SHED DOOR. Go west, GET
OVERALLS, WEAR OVERALLS, and go east twice.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15634


 Clad in overalls, Joey mistakes you for the gardener, Jimmy Risingmoon, and
lets you plow through amidst vile threats. You then make your way to Sorcerer
University's Donkeydung Hall. Your dream of entering the hallowed halls is about
to be realized (IF you have your registration form!).

 GET IN LINE (this is a good spot to save) and WAIT until you're asked to answer
several questions (the game's copy protection is based on documentation checks).

 SORCERER U.

 The story picks up a few weeks into the term: You are heading across Batguano
Court. If you like, read the school newspaper. Besides being rather humorous,
you'll notice a change each day (today is Tuesday) as sinister forces encroach.

 GET PAPER. READ NEWS. READ ARTS. READ SPORTS. READ EDITORIAL.

 It should be about time for the early afternoon class, Mythology 101. Head for
the appropriate location (you do have a schedule, don't you?), sit, and TAKE
NOTES when class begins. Keep waiting until class is over, then go northeast
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15789

from Meltingwolf Hall to Professor Tickingclock's office to receive an
invitation to dinner Wednesday night at 7:30.

 NOTE: Attending classes, taking notes, and dinner with Prof. Tickingclock are
not crucial to completing the game, but:

 A) The classes burn time, provide useful information (if you're not reading the
entire walkthru), and are amusing (as are the notes you take).

 B) If you skip dinner with the Professor, you'll miss some background
information on The Sorcerer's Appliance, and -- more importantly for the lusty
players in NAUGHTY mode -- you'll miss an encounter with Hillary Tickingclock!

 C) You do want to be a good student!

 After the late afternoon class, Ethics 101, there are a few ways to pass the
time until the all-important frat parties that start at 8:00 p.m. You can watch
the endless game of Malls 'n' Muggers being played in Frogkisser Hall, explore
your room, visit the frat houses, or just WAIT UNTIL 7:55. Then, from Batguano
Court, go southwest, WAIT twice, then open the SKONN BOX (once Bo Soundofthunder

gives it to you). Go northeast, northwest, WAIT until 8:30, and answer YES (when
Gretchen Snowbunny asks for your help). Now, go south, east, PUT GRETCHEN IN
BED, SEARCH GRETCHEN, and GET KEY.

 This first night at Sorcerer's U. you're more tired than you are most nights,
so you may just want to REST. However, if you're eager for points, you should
have enough time to get the FRIMP spell in the President's House. If not,
there's plenty of time to do that later.

 Wherever you fall asleep, when you awaken: GET KEY, SPELL BOOK, NOTEBOOK. The
rest of the stuff is unnecessary. (If you had the NAUGHTY encounter with
Gretchen, GET CLOAK and WEAR CLOAK...you oversexed devil, you!) It's now
Wednesday morning. Head to Batguano Court and check out the new issue of the
school paper if you wish, then attend your morning class: Spellcasting 101!

 After the early afternoon class on magical creatures, you've got time for some
spell-gathering and scoring (point-gathering, eager beaver!) before your dinner
date (you're excused from the late afternoon class, Physical Skills 101, due to
a slightly sprained pinkie). Go southwest from Frogkisser Hall to the Boat Dock.
UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY, OPEN DOOR, and go northwest. OPEN FRIMP BOX. Go southwest,

east, northeast, up, and SKONN STATUETTE (this, I'm sorry to say, is the only
use for that bust-enlarging spell). CLIMB STATUETTE, OPEN KABBUL BOX, and go

DOOR, and go down. Save the game here.

 You've entered the "Maize." Each room has a letter: You want to move through
the rooms spelling the phrase, T-H-I-S-W-A-Y-O-U-T, and end up in the southwest
corner where a trap door will open. So, take the following route:

 Southeast, south, east twice, and southwest. West, south, west twice, down, and
OPEN DISPAR BOX. Up, northeast, north three times, and FRIMP TRAP DOOR. OPEN
TRAP DOOR and go up.

 Nothing much else to do today (Wednesday) but to attend the dinner party in
Tickingclock's suite (upstairs from Frogkisser Hall), where you can listen to
the Professor ramble on about the Sorcerer's Appliance, examine the surfboard,
and help Hillary with the dishes afterward (NICE mode). Then, just REST until
morning.

morning class, Math and Science 101, then just go to the Simulation Lab (East
from Meltingwolf Hall), and WAIT until your disheveled mother appears to give
you the talisman. She'll be abducted, you'll be knocked out, and awaken to find
the University in ruins.

 Well, the good news is you won't have to turn in those class assignments. The
bad news is everyone's gone, the strange Sorcerer's Appliance is gone, and it
appears you're stuck on the island. But you're educated enough to use the DISPAR
spell on the surfboard in Tickingclock's suite. First, you want to go to the
Simulation Lab (if you're not there already). If you've been through the
simulation before, you know the simulation spells are always removed at the end
by a professor. Now, however, there's no one left to remove them, and you can
get them (GUB, VAI, ZEM) permanently. Here's how to do it: SIT, GUB TREE, ZEM
ME, and go south. FIGHT ATOMIC DRAGON WITH SWORD, VAI IVY, and CLIMB IVY. PUSH
LEVER and OPEN SHACKLES.

 Then, end the simulation with either OPEN TRAP DOOR or CLIMB DOWN. The spells
you gain are needed at Fort Blackwand. Now, go to the Professor's suite, DISPAR
SURFBOARD, and GET SURFBOARD. OPEN BLUBBA BOX, go down, and southwest.

 THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS

 If you set the coordinates correctly (use the map), you should hit land at The
Island of Lost Souls. Reading the sign, you discover that there are 80 souls
here, imprisoned in non-human forms by Lars Stormkiller as a penalty for
stiffing a cobbler named Waldo Bootlacer. The description of each object is a
punny clue to the name of the Lost Soul imprisoned within. The KABBUL spell will
restore the soul when used in the form KABBUL NAME. With this in mind, let's
begin. (80 souls is a lot: As one gamer said, "Just be glad the city of Chicago
didn't stiff the guy!")

 THE ISLAND WHERE TIME RUNS BACKWARDS

 Well, if you thought you'd been through some strange stuff already, wait till
you arrive (leave?) at (from?) this island. You're going to star (you have just
starred?) in a production of "Goldilocks and the Three Mud Devils" (scene 14,
take 187 -- you must be a lousy actor!). Somehow, you're dressed for the part
with a dress and golden hair. Strange, you're covered with dried mud, you just
fell off your surfboard, you're undigesting your last meal, and things just
don't feel right. Stranger still, someone just entered. GET ON THE SURFBOARD.

 What's happening here? Simple, you're playing the part in reverse: Time flows
backwards, and you must enter the command that would cause the OPPOSITE effect
that you read in the preceding text. Since you fell off the surfboard, you GET
ON THE SURFBOARD. That was a freebie; from here, you're on your own! Understand?
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-15809

I hope so because any mistake rips the fabric of time and ends the game!

 Well, next, you're yelled at by the director for dropping a piece of waybread,
and a large piece of waybread rises into your hand. So, DROP LARGE WAYBREAD.
Next, you walk backward to the north. So, naturally, you enter south. Okay, I'm
not going to waste CIS's valuable space describing everything that's going to
happen (unhappen?): I'll let you see for yourself. Go southwest, JUMP OUT
WINDOW, and WAIT twice.

 By the sound of things, it seems that the mud devils came home, noticed that
someone had been playing chess with their nuns (NICE mode), someone had been
eating their waybread, and sitting in their mudbaths. The baby mud devil
discovered you in his mudbath, so you jumped out the window. Let's proceed: GET
IN SMALL MUDBATH, GET IN MEDIUM MUDBATH, then GET IN LARGE MUDBATH. Go up, EAT
SMALL WAYBREAD, EAT MEDIUM WAYBREAD, and EAT LARGE WAYBREAD. PLAY CHESS WITH
SMALL NUN, PLAY CHESS WITH MEDIUM NUN, and PLAY CHESS WITH LARGE NUN.

 Okay, now that you've finished (started?) the Mud Devils' house, it's time to
proceed to the end (beginning?) of the scene. Go east, OPEN DOOR, READ SIGN, and
go northwest. EXAMINE PEDESTAL and go north.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15811


 Oops! It appears you arrived on the set with a BUNDEROT spell box in your hand,
and you're totally out of character! GIVE BUNDEROT BOX TO DIRECTOR and GET OFF
SURFBOARD.

 Suddenly, time resumes its forward progress, and you're on the surfboard with a
BUNDEROT spell box (bet you were wondering what this weird sequence was all
about, weren't you?). OPEN BUNDEROT BOX. Now, set the surfboard dials for The
Island of the Amazons (the Island with a woman on it). PUSH RED BUTTON, and get
ready for some real exertion!

 THE ISLAND OF THE AMAZONS

 If you read the back of the game box, you've probably been itching to get to
this place for a while. Your only legitimate purpose here is to get one little
item, but you'll be lucky to get away alive! These women hardly ever get a man
on their island; they're so desperate for one, they'll even take scrawny, nerdy
sorcerers (no offense intended, Ernie!). Every time you turn around, they'll be
needing your "assistance." So, resign yourself to some heavy-duty "work," and go
southwest to the Parade Grounds.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15813


 You'll be greeted by the Amazon Leader who will direct you to the V.I.P. suite
to the west. Go ahead: There's no sense putting off the unavoidable. After she
avails herself of your "services," OPEN HOPE CHEST. Argh! Ambushed! Now you know
what this Amazon was "hoping" for! After this encounter, GET SHOES, LOOK UNDER
BED, FRIMP BED, and GET BONNET.

 You're bound to be interrupted again while doing this. Getting tired yet?
You've got to make a break for it, soon! Unfortunately, these women will never
let a man leave, but a woman (or a reasonable facsimile) could sneak out. You
have a choice: Die from exertion, having earned the gratitude of the Amazons, or
just NEARLY die from embarrassment as you sneak past in drag! You've got the
high heel shoes and bonnet, so go up through the air vent.

 You're now in the S.I.P. (Somewhat Important Person) suite. There's a closet,
so OPEN CLOSET and GET GOWN.

 You're sure to be ambushed by the maid: Just grin and bear (bare) it; then go
up again to get back to the V.I.P. suite. If you're a glutton for punishment (by
now this routine is becoming just that!), open the door of the S.I.P. suite
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15815

first. Next, go east to the Parade Ground, then south to the general store to be
abused, this time by the shopkeeper. Afterwards, GET SWORD and LIPSTICK.

 You can read the magazine in the shop if you like; it gives you the distinct
impression the Sorcerer's Appliance and The Five Great Attachments have been
taken to Fort Blackwand. Next, you need to make your costume change. If you're
in NICE mode (nobody would be in NAUGHTY mode on THIS island, WOULD they?), you
can't remove your cloak in front of the lady! Head back to the V.I.P. suite.
Then, REMOVE CLOAK, WEAR SHOES, WEAR GOWN, WEAR BONNET, and WEAR LIPSTICK.

 If you're lucky, you'll finish dressing without another ambush. High-tail it
back to your surfboard (east and northeast) past the sniggering Amazons in the
Parade Ground, then change back into your normal garb by removing the
fashionable garments and wearing your cloak. GET ON SURFBOARD, and set the dials
for the Restaurant at the End of The Ocean: You NEED some nourishment after what
you've just been through!

 THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE OCEAN

 Unfortunately, you're not going to have time to eat here: The popular
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15817

restaurant will go from boom to bust in a few moves (remember your Ethics 101
lecture on the six stages in the life-cycle of a good restaurant?). There's a
spell floating in mid-air above the water; you'll have to get it in a roundabout
fashion. GET MAJJELLO BOX (watch your fingers!).

 So, now that little Pygmy Shark has your spell box! Well, as long as you've
come this far, go inside and check out the menu. Go north and EXAMINE MENU.
Maurice, your friendly waiter, is at your service. Hm, the Pygmy Shark looks
delicious, doesn't it? ORDER PYGMY SHARK. Boy, this is one hot spot! WAIT. Gee,
suddenly the prices have gone up, they're cutting back on "extras," and the
waiter's getting rather rude! Ah, here's your order!

 Alas, you'll never be able to eat the whole thing, and they don't allow any
takeouts. So, BUNDEROT SHARK (what a waste of food!). There's that spell box the
shark ate (poetic justice, eh?). You've just got time to OPEN MAJJELLO BOX
before the eatery goes bust and you get kicked out (you're not going to tip
Maurice, are you?).

 Back outside (by the Sail-Thru window), GET ON SURFBOARD, and set the dials for
the latitude and longitude of The Island of the Gods! Oops, what's wrong with
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-15819

the right dial? You can't seem to find the latitude setting. (Oh Boy! A puzzle!
A puzzle!) No problem for a wizard of your caliber: Just MAJJELLO RIGHT DIAL,
set the right dial again, PUSH RED BUTTON, and you're off!

 THE ISLAND OF THE GODS

 Through your incredible adventures, you've managed to get the necessary items
to go where few mortals have gone before: the fabled Island of the Gods! Your
surfboard comes to a halt at the Gateway of the Gods -- a huge portal which just
happens to be locked, denying you entrance. But, you just happen to have the key
to that portal, given to you by the grateful Mayor Blaise! So, UNLOCK ISLAND
WITH BIG KEY, and go north twice.

 Passing through the Garden of the Gods, you enter the Condo of the Gods, a
beautiful lobby with apartments to the east and west. To the east is the abode
of Baccarat and Bagatelle, gods of war and peace, respectively. Not much is
going to happen here, the real "action" is to be found in the west apartment
where Ocarina and Glockenspiel make their home.

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15822


 Glock, god of ugliness, is insanely jealous when it comes to Ock, and the last
thing a mere mortal wants to do is be caught alone in Ock's presence when Glock
shows up. So, HIDE BEHIND DRAPES, and WAIT until Ock and Glock enter the
apartment. They have a heated argument over Glock's suspicions that SOMEONE has
been helping Ock do crossword puzzles (NICE mode), and that she hasn't been
letting him help her with them for 67,912 weeks!

 After Glock storms off in a rage, Ock sneaks out the latest puzzle, and as you
WAIT, you watch her strain her brain. You have an intense DESIRE to help her,
and finally you blurt out the answer to a toughie, attracting the goddess of
beauty's attention. Well, you just have to continue, so HELP OCARINA WITH
PUZZLE.

 After a thoroughly enjoyable (intellectual) experience with Ock, she gives you
a reward in the form of a GWEEK spell box. But wait! Is that Glock's heavy
footstep approaching? No time to hide; you're about to become one melted mortal!
Oh well, at least you can get another spell and a few points before you become
ancient history. OPEN GWEEK BOX.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15824

 Glockenspiel barges in ready to toast you! But instead, he drags you outside to
the Garbage Dump of the Gods, north of the Condo. A millennium's worth of
garbage is accumulated here, and Glock has volunteered you to clean it ALL up!
(Maybe death by lightning bolt would be more merciful.) Fortunately, you have
the means to handle it. GWEEK GARBAGE DUMP, then BUNDEROT GARBAGE DUMP.

 Behold! You have done what all the gods could not (or were too lazy to do): You
have recycled the Garbage Dump of the Gods into the Meadow of the Gods (it
should have been Ernie's Meadow, in my opinion)! In the process, you uncovered a
GOBERDUNA spell box, hidden for ages. You also seem to have started an argument
among the gods over the new use for the meadow. Time to make your exit. OPEN
GOBERDUNA BOX, go south three times, and LOCK ISLAND WITH BIG KEY (you don't
want these omnipotent, immature beings unleashed, do you?).

 Now, GET ON SURFBOARD and set the controls for Fort Blackwand, where you know
the Sorcerer's Appliance has been taken. PUSH RED BUTTON, and you soon arrive at
the Lagoon, where the dreaded Loch Pick Monster blocks your path. No sweat! Just
GOBERDUNA SERPENT, and the knotty problem is solved!

 FORT BLACKWAND
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15826


 Head east from the lagoon. Does this look familiar? This is the castle in the
Sorcerer U. simulation lab! This time, however, you've got to get it right the
first time. Okay, Equipment check: Lead-plated sword? Got the GUB, ZEM, and VAI
spells from the simulator? Well, then, GUB TREE, ZEM ME, and go south. FIGHT
ATOMIC DRAGON WITH SWORD, VAI IVY, then CLIMB IVY. PUSH LEVER and OPEN SHACKLES.

 Surprise, surprise! The damsel in the revealing dress is Lola Tigerbelly! She's
pretty bossy, Ernie; what DO you see in her? TAKE PURSE. (Hey, you've already
been in drag, so what's wrong with carrying a purse?) Among other things, her
purse contains a flamethrower, just what every defenseless damsel needs for the
occasional mugger or kidnaper (why didn't it help her this time, you wonder?).

 You must stop the fiend from using the Sorcerer's appliance to destroy the
world. So, overcome your fear of the unknown, OPEN TRAP DOOR, and go down.

 Before you are three gates of Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Before each gate is an
"X," also wrought in Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Standing on an "X" opens the gate
of its color. Unfortunately, you can't stand on all three at once. Luckily, you
can tell Lola to stand on one. This still leaves you one person short. But,
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15829

isn't that picture on the wall rather familiar? Nice piece of "Art!" STAND ON
GOLD X. LOLA, STAND ON SILVER X. KABBUL ART. ART, STAND ON BRONZE X.

 The way your heartthrob Lola reacts to Art's appearance should make your blood
boil! Again I ask, WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HER? Oh, well, with all three gates open,
go west where you will encounter....

 THE STUNNING CLIMAX!

 You enter a huge chamber wherein rests the Sorcerer's Appliance! Also, the
chamber just happens to hold Professor Tickingclock, who's manacled to a wall,
as well as the hideous monster who did so many horrible things, including the
the despicable act of ravaging Lola! Yes, this beast must be the worst creature
in all Peloria: your stepfather, Joey Rottenwood!

 You may as well WAIT while Rottenwood tells his story. (Isn't that always what
happens in the movies? You're forced to listen to the villain tell his entire
life's story? There ought to be a law!). But, when Joey prepares (with a
dramatic pause) to press both buttons on the Appliance at once, it's time for
Ernie Eaglebeak to make his move!
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-15831


 Remember that delightful book, "Endgame Surprise," that you just haven't been
able to put down? GIVE POPULAR BOOK TO JOEY. Rottenwood, instantly absorbed in
the book, is no longer able to press both buttons simultaneously! He sits down,
totally engrossed at the prospect of a good read, and triggers the destruct mode
on the Sorcerer's Appliance! A spell box, EKSLAKSIA (spell of unloading), falls
out of the machine! Tickingclock informs you that in 15 minutes (that's three
moves) the Appliance will explode, taking this corner of Peloria with it; the
only way to override it is to dump at seven tons of whale poop on it!

 (Aren't you on the edge of your seat right now?)

 Fifteen minutes: CAST BLUBBA. If you've done this before, you know the whale
knocks your spell book out of your hands. With 10 minutes (two moves) left, you
can't GET BOOK, OPEN EKSLAKSIA BOX, and CAST EKSLAKSIA. So, what do you do, now?

 Ten minutes: You make the ultimate sacrifice: BURN SPELL BOOK. Your most prized
possesion goes up in smoke as the flamethrower blasts it! Why, oh, why did you
do it? (My apologies to Legend Entertainment and Steve Meretzky: I have to give
away this little secret from the manual). If you open a spell box in the

CompuServe CIS:TEG-15833

presence of your spell book, it goes into the book. Otherwise, the spell is cast
and lost.

 Five minutes: OPEN EKSLAKSIA BOX. The spell, with no direction, has the general
effect of causing everyone (including the whale) to dump their loads. The
Appliance's destruct sequence is aborted, everyone is free -- the entire
Sorcerer U. gang, your mother, and Rottenwood (who slinks away). The Appliance
is taken through a portal to the sequel, and Tickingclock transports you all
back to the University. Lola runs off to Balmoral City to shop, you get hit with
a huge tuition bill, reprimanded for using level 5 spells, and advanced out of
Spellcasting 101 to return in SPELLCASTING 201: THE SORCERER'S APPLIANCE.

                          S P E L L B R E A K E R 
                                 (Infocom)

Notes.
(1) It's a good idea to learn all spells more than once since they
    don't always work!
(2) Whenever a spell is mentioned in this solution, you must cast it
    until it works - this is not a problem with the 'Blorple' spell
    or when you have the "Magic Cube".
(3) It is essential to keep track of where each cube takes you, which
    you do by writing on them with the Burin.
(4) The Zipper is used for storage......if you're told that you're
    carrying too much to pick up another item, then place a few things
    inside the zipper.
(5) Unless you are in imminent danger, sleep almost anywhere EXCEPT
    the Bazaar!
(6) SAVE GAME VERY OFTEN!!!


                               THE SOLUTION

You  start in the Council Chamber carrying a Spell Book, Burin and a Knife.
The Spell Book contains some spells as follows:

        LESOCH............Gust of wind
        YOMIN.............Mind probe
        REZROV............Open locked or enchanted objects
        FROTZ.............Cause something to give off light
        GNUSTO............Write spell into your Spell Book
        MALYON............Animate an inanimate object
        JINDAK............Detect magic

After  a  couple  of moves the BLORPLE spell will automatically be added to
the  Spell  Book. It is used to explore an object's mystic connections. You
start  by  having  permanently  committed  to memory the GNUSTO, REZROV and
FROTZ spells. All others will need to be learned and re-learned as they are
required.  Also  remember that you will not be able to keep as many in your
head at one time if you are tired. If you are tired you will need to SLEEP.
This refreshes you but also makes you forget any temporary spells. When you
awake  you will need to re-learn whatever spells you think you are about to
need. DO NOT GO TO SLEEP UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SPELL BOOK!

From  the Council Chamber go SOUTH to the Guild Hall and TAKE the BREAD and
the  FISH,  then  go  SOUTH  again into Belwit Square. If there is a lot of
smoke  around,  either  LESOCH the smoke - which, like all other spells may
only  work  at  random  -  or  simply  WAIT  until it clears. You will then
discover  a WHITE CUBE. TAKE the CUBE and to identify it - do the same with
ALL  other cubes you find - WRITE "EARTH" ON CUBE. You will only be able to
write  on  the  cubes  if  you are holding the Burin. This is a good way of
being able to identify the cubes later when you may be carrying quite a few
at one time and will need to select a particular one in a hurry.

By  now  the  BLORPLE  SPELL  will  have appeared in your Spell Book. LEARN
BLORPLE  then  BLORPLE "EARTH" CUBE - you may need the inverted commas here
always!  You  will  now  be transported to the Packed Earth Room. FROTZ the
KNIFE to get a source of light.

Go  EAST  to  the  Hall  Of  Stone. TAKE and then OPEN ZIPPER. REACH INSIDE
ZIPPER  to  discover  a  SCROLL.  TAKE  SCROLL then EXAMINE IT. This is the
GIRGOL  SCROLL.  It cannot be GNUSTO'd and therefore can be used ONLY ONCE!
Be  careful where you use it. BLORPLE "EARTH" CUBE - remember you will need
to  constantly  re-learn these spells - to return to the Packed Earth Room.
Go  DOWN  twice.  Don't worry about falling, you will soon be rescued. WAIT
until  you  are  in  the  Roc's  Nest  then TAKE the CASKLY SCROLL. BLORPLE
"EARTH"  CUBE  to  get back to the Packed Earth Room. Don't worry about the
cube in the Roc's Nest at this time.

Go  SOUTH  to  the  Cliff Middle. TAKE the THROCK SCROLL and go UP. Go UP a
couple  of  more  times  until  you are told on screen that you'd better do
something  quickly  or die, then CAST GIRGOL. This time-stopping spell will
halt  the  avalanche.  Now  go  UP  again  until  you  reach the Top of the
Mountain. TAKE the GOLD COIN and go INTO the Hut. ASK the Old Man about the
cube/hut/whatever,  but  then to get the CUBE you must CASKLY THE HUT. This
repairs  the  Hut  so that the Old Man no longer needs the CUBE and you can
now  TAKE  it.  Mark  this  one with the Burin "SOFT". BLORPLE "EARTH" CUBE
again to go back to the Packed Earth Room.

Leave  the  Packed  Earth  Room  -  NOT DOWN!! - WEST (for instance) - then
BLORPLE  "SOFT" CUBE. From the Soft Room go SOUTH and TAKE the SHEARS. PULL
WEED  -  twice  -  to  get it and then it is time to get back to the Packed
Earth Room by the usual method. Go WEST again then NORTH. You should now be
in  the  Ogre's  Cave.  PLANT  THE WEED and then THROCK THE WEED to make it
grow.  The Ogre has hay fever and will now be sneezing so much that you can
go  DOWN  past  him  without  any trouble. TAKE the GOLD BOX and OPEN it to
reveal  another  CUBE.  Mark this one "WATER". The SCROLL is the ESPNIS and
should  be GNUSTO'd at once as should ALL scrolls you find. Back now to the
Packed Earth Room.

Go  EAST  (for  instance) and get the "EARTH" CUBE again. Learn the BLORPLE
Spell  a  couple  of  times  and  FROTZ  the ZIPPER. Put everything but the
"WATER"  CUBE, the "EARTH" CUBE and the piece of BREAD into the ZIPPER then
CLOSE  the  ZIPPER.  BLORPLE THE "WATER" CUBE. You will now be in the Water
Room.  Go  SOUTH  and you should be in some water. The ZIPPER is waterproof
and  will keep things such as your Spell Book safe as long as the ZIPPER is
CLOSED.  You  will now be confronted by a GROUPER which is hungry. You will
also  see  a  BOTTLE  and  the "WATER" cube which you will have dropped and
which  you will need again. Unless you are careful the GROUPER will swallow
one  of  the  things  you are going to need, so quickly DROP THE BREAD! The
GROUPER  will  go  after  this  enabling you to GET BOTTLE THEN GET "WATER"
CUBE. Now back to the Packed Earth Room yet again!

The  BOTTLE  contains a damp SCROLL. Once you have re-opened the ZIPPER and
taken  the  Spell Book, you can GNUSTO the new SCROLL (LISKON). Now go EAST
and  then  NORTH.  You need to have memorised the LISKON, MALYON and ESPNIS
spells here. When you find the SERPENT, LISKON SERPENT. This shrinks it and
you  can go NORTH past it. Go NORTH again to the Room of the Idol. There is
a  CUBE  in  it's  mouth.  The mouth is not open enough to let you take the
CUBE.  The  only  answer is to bring the idol to life with MALYON THE IDOL.
WAIT  until  you are told that it is definately looking for you then ESPNIS
THE IDOL. This makes it fall asleep. If all goes well it will yawn and then
fall over asleep and then turn back to basalt with it's mouth wide open! If
not,  you  may have to do the spell-casting again. Once you succeed you can
TAKE and mark the "AIR" CUBE.

BLORPLE  THE  "AIR"  CUBE then go NORTH. TAKE the TINSOT SCROLL and BLORPLE
THE  "AIR"  CUBE  again.  GNUSTO TINSOT then go WEST to the Bazaar. Go EAST
into the Shop where there are TWO CARPETS for sale. Eventually you want the
BLUE  one. ASK the Merchant about the carpets. HAGGLE! When he asks for 800
Zorkmids, offer 100. When he asks for 700, offer 200, etc. When he asks for
500  Zorkmids  and holds out his hand, GIVE him the GOLD COIN. He will then
give  you  a carpet. Check your INVENTORY before you leave the Shop. If you
have  the  RED  CARPET, ASK MERCHANT FOR BLUE CARPET. He will apologise and
exchange  it!  Once you have left the Shop it will be too late! Now you can
leave.  LOOK UNDER THE CARPET and READ the LABEL you find there. This magic
flying carpet can now be used if and when required.

You  now  need  to learn the LISKON spell and the BLORPLE spell a couple of
times.  Now  go to the Packed Earth Room again and then go EAST to the Hall
Of Stone. DROP ALL here EXCEPT for the "WATER" CUBE and FROTZ SELF to get a
source  of  light. BLORPLE "WATER" CUBE and go UP when you get to the Water
Room.  You  are  now  in  the Oubliette. LISKON SELF to make yourself small
enough  to  be  able  to  ENTER OUTFLOW PIPE. Go WEST and TAKE the CUBE you
find. Go WEST again and then UP into the Ruins Room. NORTH back to the Hall
Of  Stone.  Take your belongings again and EXTINGUISH SELF to stop glowing.
WRITE "CHANGE" on the new CUBE.

Now  you  need  to  learn  the TINSOT spell THREE TIMES and then BLORPLE at
least  ONCE.  Put  the  perishables,  such as the Spell Book, back into the
Zipper  and  CLOSE  it.  BLORPLE "WATER" CUBE then go UP into the Oubliette
again.  Above you, but out of reach, is a Trap Door. REZROV the TRAPDOOR to
open  it.  TINSOT  THE  WATER  to freeze the outflow pipe. TINSOT THE WATER
again  since once was not enough to fully freeze the pipe. When the chamber
is full you will still be a little short of thr Trap Door. TINSOT THE WATER
a  third  time  to  create an ice floe. CLIMB ONTO ICE and you will then be
able to go UP through the Trap Door.

TAKE  and  MARK  the  "BONE" CUBE and then go EAST and NORTH to the Dungeon
Cell.  REZROV  THE  CABINET and get the MOLDY BOOK. If you CASKLY THE MOLDY
BOOK it will become somewhat repaired. READ IT and you will find the SNAVIG
spell.  Get  it  GNUSTO'd right away. Now go SOUTH then EAST then UP to the
Top of the Guard Tower. Drop the CARPET and SIT ON CARPET. A small speck in
the  distance  will  turn out to be Mother Roc approaching. Once you are on
the  CARPET,  go  UP  and then carpet should fly. If not, you couldn't have
READ  the  LABEL!  Once airborne go WEST until you are above the Roc's Nest
then  go  DOWN. DON'T GET LOST!! Now, quickly, get off the carpet, take the
CUBE,  SIT  ON  THE  CARPET and then go UP. You have very little time to do
this.  Iff  the  EGG cracks and you are confronted by the Baby Roc, you are
going  to DIE!! Once in the air, go EAST until you are over the Guard Tower
and go DOWN, GET OFF THE CARPET. TAKE CARPET then go DOWN into the Tower to
escape the Mother Roc. Now is a good time to MARK the latest CUBE "STRING".
See,  aren't  there a lot of cubes?! Good thing we decided to use the Burin
to mark them, eh?!!

Learn  the  SNAVIG  spell  once  and  the BLORPLE a couple of times and put
everything  but  the  "WATER"  and "EARTH" cubes into the Zipper. CLOSE the
ZIPPER and BLORPLE "WATER" CUBE. This time go SOUTH from the Water Room and
firstly  TAKE THE CUBE which drops from your hand. Then SNAVIG THE GROUPER.
You  will  now  turn  into a Grouper. Go DOWN to the Grouper's Nest. WAIT a
couple  of  times  until  you regain your own form then TAKE ALL. Go UP and
BLORPLE  THE  "EARTH"  CUBE once more. You know where you are now. OPEN THE
ZIPPER, TAKE THE BURIN and WRITE "LIGHT" on the new CUBE.

Leave  the  Packed  Earth  Room  and BLORPLE THE "CHANGE" CUBE. This is the
Changing  Room.  Go  NORTH and TAKE THE COMPASS you find there. BLORPLE THE
"CHANGE"  CUBE  again.  The  COMPASS  is needed in the next section but may
require  'charging'. To do this go WEST and PUT COMPASS IN CARVING that you
see  in  the  North Wall. A hole now opens in this Wall. Go NORTH but don't
forget to take the compass first. If you do forget you will have to BLORPLE
THE  "CHANGE" CUBE again to get out. In the area you have noe entered there
are  RUNES on the wall. Some are lead and some silver. Apart from the North
Wall,  if  you  TOUCH  THE  ROSE  TO THE (Direction) WALL, if that wall has
silver runes on it, then another hole will appear through which you can go.
SEARCH  through this area until you are in a room with an ALABASTER PLUG in
the  WEST  wall.  When you find this room, IGNORE the GOLD RUNE. REZROV the
PLUG  and  go  WEST. TAKE THE CUBE you will find and WRITE "NOPLACE" on it,
although  it will only show "NOPLAC" as the program only uses the first SIX
letters of inputs!

BLORPLE  THE  "LIGHT"  CUBE to put yourself into the Light Room. Go WEST to
the  Volcano  Base. WAIT until the LAVA FRAGMENT lands near you then TINSOT
THE  FRAGMENT.  Now  it  is cool enough to take. BLORPLE THE "NOPLAC" CUBE.
From  the Noplace Room go SOUTH onto the Plain. You will see TWO ROCKS. One
near  and one further away. Try to CLIMB onto the nearer rock. No? It wants
feeding!  GIVE  LAVA FRAGMENT TO ROCK. Now you can climb onto the rock. The
idea  here is to trap the other rock in the way that a checkmate is made in
chess.  Map  the  Plain  to  find  an  oddity.  One  corner  (Northwest) is
different!  Using  the  command:  ROCK, WEST or ROCK, SOUTH, etc., make the
Green-Eyed  Rock  carry  you  about  the Plain. Once you go through the odd
Northwest  diagonal  you  will  be able to close in on the Brown-Eyed Rock.
When  the  two  rocks  are near each other, the Brown-Eyed Rock will become
mesmerised.  You  can now CLIMB ONTO THE BROWN-EYED ROCK and TAKE the CUBE.
MARK it "DARK" and then BLORPLE THE "DARK" CUBE. Learn the SNAVIG spell and
go  DOWN  to the Dark Cave from the Dark Room. Make sure that you are NOT a
Light  Source,  but  ensure that something else is such a source, e.g., the
Zipper.  Drop  everything  here and go DOWN to the Grue Cave. SNAVIG A GRUE
and  go DOWN to the Light Pool. CLIMB THE PILLAR and take the CUBE from the
TOP.  CLIMB  DOWN  PILLAR and return UP and UP again to the Dark Cave. Take
all  and  WRITE "FIRE" on the CUBE. When you return to your own self again,
BLORPLE THE "FIRE" CUBE.

You  need  to increase your magical ability to get much further. To do this
you  need to choose a CUBE. For instance, the "EARTH" CUBE. Put this chosen
cube  into the GOLD BOX. The BOX changes slightly. TAKE THE CUBE OUT AGAIN.
Go NORTH from the Fire Room where you should be now, and THROW THE GOLD BOX
onto  the  Outcropping  that you can see. Now BLORPLE (the name of the cube
that  you put in and then out of the box). From the location you are now in
you will be able to go through the exit that was magically blocked earlier.
For example, from the Packed Earth Room you can now go NORTH. This will put
you  beside the GOLD BOX! TAKE THE BOX AND THE CUBE and re-BLORPLE yourself
away. WRITE "MAGIC" on this CUBE.

BLORPLE  "STRING"  CUBE.  From  the String Room go SOUTH to the Enchanter's
Retreat.  Here  you  will meet good old Belboz again. Ask him about various
things  to show you need help and he will ask you a question. The answer is
IN  THE  CARDS THAT CAME WITH THE ORIGINAL GAME PACKAGING! Answer correctly
and  he  will give you a WROUGHT IRON KEY. Now BLORPLE "NOPLAC" CUBE again.
Learn  the  JINDAK  spell  THREE TIMES and the BLORPLE ONCE. Go EAST to the
Inner  Vault and REZROV the DOOR. Go NORTH. You now hava a major problem to
solve  and  only three spells may be cast before the Guards are alerted and
come  to drag you away!! Also NO SAVE POSITIONS ARE POSSIBLE IN HERE!!! The
problem MUST be solved in ONE GO!!

You  will  see  two  piles  of cubes marked 'x1' to 'x10'. If the piles are
JINDAK'd they will GLOW. There is only ONE REAL CUBE and that will make its
pile glow BRIGHTER than the other.

To find the REAL CUBE carefully follow these instructions:

Put  all your bits and pieces in the Zipper to make moving the cubes around
a bit easier.

1.  Take  x1,  x2,  x7,  x8 cubes from the piles. JINDAK. If the piles glow
evenly  then  go to step 2. If the glow is uneven then make a note which is
the brighter one and go to step 5.

2.  Take  x3,  x4.  Put x1, x2 on the first pile. JINDAK. If the piles glow
evenly then go to step 3. If they are uneven then go to step 4.

3.  Take  x1.  Put x7 on the first pile. JINDAK. If the piles are even then
BLORPLE x8, if uneven then take x7 and BLORPLE IT. Now go to step 9.

4.  Take  x1.  Put x7 on the first pile. JINDAK. If the piles are even then
BLORPLE  x1.  If  the  piles are uneven then take x7. BLORPLE IT. Now go to
step 9.

5.  Put x1, x2, x7 on the second pile. Get x9, x10, x11, x12. Put x9 on the
first  pile.  Get  x6.  Put x6 on the second pile. JINDAK. If the piles are
even  then go to step 6. If uneven in the same way as in step 1, then go to
step 7. If the piles are uneven in the opposite way then go to step 8.

6.  Take  all  the cubes off each pile, in turn and drop them all. Take and
put  x10  on  the  first  pile,  then  take and put all on the second pile.
JINDAK. If the piles are even get x12 and then BLORPLE IT. If the piles are
uneven  as  in step 1, then get x11 and BLORPLE IT. If the piles are uneven
in the opposite way, then get x10 then BLORPLE IT. Go to step 9.

7.  Take  and drop all the cubes from both piles. Take cubes x3, x4. Put x3
on  the first pile and x4 on the second pile. JINDAK. If the piles are even
take  x5  and BLORPLE IT. If the piles are uneven as in step 1 then take x3
and BLORPLE IT. If the piles are uneven in the opposite way then get x4 and
BLORPLE IT. Go to step 9.

8.  Take and drop all the cubes from both piles. Take x6, x1. Put x6 on the
first  pile and x1 on the second pile. JINDAK. If the piles are even get x9
and  BLORPLE  IT. If the piles are uneven then get x6 and BLORPLE IT. Go to
step 9.

9.  If you are now in the Nondescript Room, you've done something wrong. If
you are in the Sand Room then CONGRATULATIONS!!


The  areas  up and down from the Sand Room are actually places in the past.
Places  you  have  been to before. UP goes to the Ruins where you found the
Zipper, and DOWN goes to the Dungeon Cell where you found the MOLDY BOOK in
the  cupboard.  Of  course  things look different because you are now quite
some  time in your own past. The problems in these two areas must be solved
correctly  and  fully  or you will be unable to leave here alive! The basic
idea  is  to leave things in such a way that they will be just as you found
them earlier in the game when time has passed by.

Going DOWN first. UNLOCK the CABINET with the IRON KEY you got from Belboz.
If  the  key  explodes  and kills you, then you must have answered Belboz's
questions  incorrectly!  (ALL the answers are in the set of cards that come
with  the  original  Infocom  game!)  OPEN the CABINET to discover a VELLUM
SCROLL  which  is  blank.  Now  make  sure  that you have the BLORPLE SPELL
memorised  a couple of times because you are about to lose your Spell Book.
Put  the  Spell  Book  in the cabinet. Obviously this will later become the
MOLDY  book you found! CLOSE and then LOCK the CABINET. Remember.....it was
LOCKED  when  you  found  it! TAKE the KEY with you. Remember what the Cell
Door  was  like? O.K. then......REZROV the DOOR and then, before the Guards
arrive, BLORPLE THE "SAND" CUBE.

Now  go UP to the Ruins Room. This is where you will later find the Zipper.
At  the moment there is just a SACK here. Right! TAKE and OPEN the SACK. It
contains  a  FLIMSY SCROLL.....seem familiar? EXAMINE IT. It has the GIRGOL
SPELL  on  it which, as you know, you could only use ONCE........But!....if
you had a BLANK scroll on which to COPY the GIRGOL SPELL?!! WRITE GIRGOL ON
VELLUM SCROLL (with the Burin). Now EMPTY THE ZIPPER INTO THE SACK. PUT THE
FLIMSY SCROLL IN THE ZIPPER and then CLOSE ZIPPER. DROP the ZIPPER. This is
how  you  found  the  room  originally  wasn't it?! All that was here was a
Zipper  containing  a  Flimsy Scroll! TAKE the SACK and BLORPLE THE "MAGIC"
CUBE.

From  the  Magic Room go EAST to the Castle where you will be confronted by
your  shadowy  enemy  at  last!  If  left  to his own pace, the figure will
eventually freeze you to enable him to have enough time to complete certain
deeds.  However, since he is now aware of your increased magical abilities,
he  does  not  realise that after a few moves you will shake off the spell.
Unfortunately,  if  you  let  him freeze you when HE wants to, there is not
enough  time to shake off the spell. You need to annoy the figure enough so
that  he will notice and freeze you much sooner. As soon as you can see the
figure try ATTACK FIGURE. He will freeze you. Now just WAIT for a while. If
you  do  anything  else,  you will be noticed and re-frozen. Do nothing but
WAIT  until  the  freeze  spell  wears  off.  Keep WAITing until the figure
IGNORES  YOU!!  Now,  as  long as you remembered to bring the VELLUM SCROLL
with  the  copy  of  the  GIRGOL  SPELL on it with you, you will be able to
defeat him.

WAIT until the figure is just about to leap into the Hypercube he has built
and  then  CAST  GIRGOL.  Time  will stop and you have a couple of moves in
which  to  win  or  lose!  Remove  the  "MAGIC" CUBE from the Hypercube and
replace  it with the SMOKED FISH. The Hypercube is being built to rearrange
the  Universe  in  the manner that the shadowy figure wants. It is based on
the  item  in the centre of the Hypercube. The figure wants MAGIC hence the
"MAGIC"  cube  is in the middle. If you remove the "MAGIC" cube then do not
put  anything  else  in  there,  then the new Universe will be built around
nothing!  (DESTROYED!!!). If you put any magical item there the figure will
get what he wants. So by using a NON-MAGICAL item, such as the SMOKED FISH,
a totally new Universe will be created.

As time starts again, the figure will enter the Hypercube and you will have
WON THE GAME!!!!

You should now have scored 600/600 and achieved the class of SCIENTIST!!

towards the gears, type "swing pulley".  Walk up to his body and
get the belt.

The 7-Up Cool Spots
-------------------
Release by THG!  Short intro-type docs by Mr. Xerox
Call LakeSide Park 203/929-7437 3.4+ gigs 14.4k hst/v42 Tsan Ct Outpost THG!



This game is actually quite amusing, and it's addicting as hell... if you're
an Othello player, you'd like it, but it's not difficult to figure out and
beat the shit out of your opponent...

You can use the keyboard or joystick to move around, but I kinda wish it had
mouse support... woulda helped out a lot.  For all I know it does, I was
just to lazy to plug my mouse in and load a driver.

The object is simple -- you have to end up with more pieces on the board
than your opponent has, just like Othello.  You start out as red, and your
opponent starts out as green (in a one-player vs computer game).  In order
to increase your number of spots, you can select one of your current spots
and move the animated spot to an adjacent spot (I'm getting to hate that
word... spot)... then you'll have your original one, and a new one at the
new location.

If you move your spot at least two spots away from it's current location,
it'll move, not multiply like moving it adjacent to itself.  Either way, any
of your opponents spots that are within a block away from when you stick
your new spot will flip to your color.

I also don't think you can move your spot more than 3 spaces away from where
it is now.

Gotta love how these spots move... seen then do forward dives, backwards
dives, salutes, breakdance, pole vault... gotta love it. Only in America.

That's most likely about it... it's a fun game when you beat on it, and it
can get wild when you're fucked up and the spots start moonwalking across
the screen and shit...

That's it - I'm outta here.

                       Space Quest IV Beta
                            Debug Keys
                            By Beamer

THG's release of Space Quest 4 is a beta version which still 
contains Sierra's debugging code. A few of these functions have 
always seemed to survive in many of the released versions of 
Sierra's software, but never have we been treated to the number 
of functions available in this release. Following are the 
functions I have discovered and my attempt at interpreting them.

Alt A   gives current status of Ego (Ego is the main character)

Alt B   displays "Script .943 not found" and exits to DOS (???)

Alt C   display changes to the Priority bands. These are the 
        rough areas which control the priority of objects to 
        each other. Hit Alt C again to return to game screen.

Alt D   Debug on/off toggle. This has many commands of it's own, 
        most of which are probably the same as the Alt commands. 
        I haven't experimented with this enough to speak of.

Alt E   Gives info on available objects. The objects displayed 
        vary according to where you are.

Alt F   Gives available memory parameters

Alt G   Allows you to change variable values, if you know the 
        variable names.

Alt I   This is one of the better ones. It displays all the 
        possible inventory items and lets you get anything you 
        want. Just click on anything, or everything, you want! 
        Remember though, getting things this way can cause the 
        program to behave in strange manners.

Alt M   Adds 20 buckazoids to your bankroll. Good when you HAVE 
        to buy that hintbook at the mall and haven't used Alt I 
        for a bank card.

Alt N   This is used to save bug reports (for the code jockeys 
        to decipher).

Alt P   Another screen mode, similar to the Alt C screen. I 
        haven't deciphered the difference. To exit this screen, 
        hit Alt C twice.

Alt R   Gives the room number and additional info for the 
        current room. Use these in conjunction with Alt T.

Alt T   Another biggie. Teleports you to any room (screen) you 
        like. If the room number you enter does not exist, you 
        get dumped back to DOS. Here are just a few valid room 
        numbers:

             25 to 115, in increments of 5, are the rooms you 
             begin Space Quest in. Room 72 is the manhole.
             410  Skate-O-Rama
             391  Software store
             371  Clothes store
             390  Radio Shock
             385  Monolith Burger
             375  Arcade
             340  being tortured by 2 luscious babes
             150  Roger Jr. in the ray
             610  Bar from Space Quest 1
             535  Docking bay on first planet

Alt W   displays "Script .948 not found" and exits to DOS (???)

Alt Y   Allows input of "vanishing" variable.

Alt Z   Exits to DOS

        So, enjoy and have fun.

        Since Space Quest IV is out(either it's beta version of
real version) and it is just amazingly great, here's the
storyline of Space Quest series so far...

        Roger Wilco, the janitor and yourself, was having a nap
in the closet as usual in the mother ship. And suddenly Roger
heard a big crash and screaming. After while, he went out and
everyone died and there were few aliens seeking human to kill.
Vohaul took the Star Generator, the artificial sun for planet
Xenon, Vohaul's gonna use it for weapons, in the Space Quest I,
the object of the game is destroy the Star Generator. Time
passes, a lot of adventures and thrillings... finally you destroy
Star Generator and be a hero of Xenon and Space Quest I: The
Sarien Encounter is over with glory.

        Now as usual, inspite of your herotical job on first
one, our hero Roger is cleaning the outside of ship. And you hear
the buzz calling him... now Vohaul wants to kill Roger! He is
kidnapped by those aliens. But on the way the fuel ran out and
our hero Roger gets chance to escape. And his another adventure
begins... finally he finds Vohaul and just right before Vohaul
make fake android salesmen, our hero Roger kills Vohaul with his
plan... now he has done two things! Roger now wants to go back to
his planet Xenon, he set automatic pilot and get into little
sleep... that's end of Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge.

        While the little pod was going to planet Xenon, the
pirates finds the pod and just put them in their garbage and
tresure place just in case they might need it later... now our
Roger is somewhere in universe where he doesn't even know why he
is there. He picks up few things and get a new ship and escape
from pirates' ship. Now he is hanging around and he just happened
to see the help wanted by two guys from andromeda. Our hero can't
pass that message! He finally rescue two guys and at the same
time rescue the universe by destroying their ultimate weapons. At
the end, Two guyd and Roger happened to land on California, USA.
Specifically in the parking lot of Sierra On Line company. Ken
came out and hire Two guys from andromeda as programmer, but
tough luck for our Roger, Ken doesn't need any janitor. So our
hero Roger going back to his planet finally... at least he
tries... that's the end of Space Quest III: The Pirates of
Pestulon.

        Now, Space Quest IV he still tries to go back to Xenon,
but this time he is right place in wrong time. He is in Space
Quest XII! He got to stop that main computer's ruling and turn
back to clock... but the ultimate goal of Space Quest IV is go
back to Space Quest IV... his homeland at his time...

        This was Space Quest series story, hope it gives you more
fun with your playing Space Quest IV: Time Ripper.

STAR TREK 25TH ANNIVERSARY WALK-THRU

The following is a walk through for Star Trek: 25th Anniversary.

It is possible that you can get extra points for following a certain
dialogue (friendly, aggressive, eat this, etc).  So if you find that you
didn't get 100%, but know that you got everything, go back and try saying
different things to the people and creatures that you meet.  You can also
try talking, looking, and using your tricorder on different people and
items.  That will sometimes raise your mission score.

DEMON WORLD
After the fight, go to Navigation and select Pollux V as your destination.
Upon arriving, orbit the
planet.  Beam down to the planet (tab, click on Kirk, select second option
or press (K)irk, select second option).  Make sure your shields are down.
TALK to the man.  Go north.  USE your phaser (any one) to shoot the
Klingons that pop up.  They will only stun your players, so there's not a
whole lot to worry about.  GET the hand of the Klingon that falls off.  Go
north.  GET the berries at the right of the cave entrance.  Go back to the
'village' (south, south). Enter the bottom building.  USE Bones on the
injured man.  USE the berries on the man standing at the far left of the
screen (not part of the OA party).  Leave the building.  Enter the top
building.  USE the berries on the same man as before.  USE the berries on
the Ardak-4 (machine at the upper-left).  USE the hand on the man.  USE the
hand on the workbench (center of screen).  USE the glass case (make sure
you aren't using something on the glass case).  After you talk to the man,
GET the twisted metal (far right) and the skull (far left).  USE the
computer.  Leave the building.  Enter the bottom building.  USE the hypo-
ditoxin on the injured man.  Leave the building.  Go north, north, north.
(Best to save here.) USE the phaser on the rocks.  You MUST shoot the very
top rock that is a little left of the center of the screen first.  After
that, the order doesn't matter.  You just want to clear the doorway.  USE
Bones on the man. USE the hand on the panel.  USE the panel just beneath
the three colored spheres.  Set the dials so that they are just a little
below center, and only ONE colored mark from each column lights up.  A
booth should then pop up.  USE key on creature.

HIJACKED
Go to Navigation and select Beta Myamid.  After the fight, Orbit the
planet.  Hail the ship (tab, click on Uhura, select the icon).  Talk to
Spock.  Look up the entry for MASADA on the Computer.  Make note of the
input override code 293391-197736-3829.  Hail the Masada.  Select to send
the input override code though (don't hail the pirates).  Beam over to the
ship.  Make sure your shields are down.  USE Bones on man.  GET item in
locker (transmogrifier).  Go east.  GET items at bottom right hand corner
of screen.  USE phaser on welder (click on USE icon, click on your
inventory, click on phaser, click on inventory again, click on welder). USE
welder on scraps of metal.  USE comb bit on transmogrifier.  Go into brig
(door on the right wall).  Get ready with your phasers though.  USE stun
Use Spock on the wires underneath the panel.  Use panel.  Get wires.
GET the bomb.  Go west.  Use welder on door to the west of it.
DON'T go to bridge!.  Go South.  You should be
back in the transporter room now.  USE the modified transmogrifier on the
transporter controls.  USE the long set of wires on the controls.  USE the
transporter pad.  Once you have beamed over, immediately TALK to the
captain of the pirates (center of the screen) and tell him to surrender.

LOVE'S LABOR JEOPARDIZED
Go to Navigation and select Ark-7.  After the fight, beam over to the
Masada.  Go West(Red door).  Use freezer.  Get culture.  Close freezer. Go
north (center doors).  GET wrench.  USE red panel (right).  USE wrench on
vent.  USE vent on engineering access panel (left of screen).  GET
insulation.  Go south.  USE insulation on distiller (it will make
polyberylcarbonate).  Go thru top WEST door. Use cabinet.  Get antigrav
unit.  USE wrench to turn on gas feed (knob above tanks of gas).  USE
synthesizer.  GET bottle of water.  USE polyberylcarbonate on synthesizer
(same spot where you got the bottle).  USE synthesizer.  GET TLTDH gas.  Go
east.  Go north. USE wrench on N2 tank.  USE antigrav unit on N2 tank.  Go

Hi everyone... I guess this will complete the Strike Force Cobra story, and
will also let _you_ complete the game. :) First of all, an introduction to
the game:

A mad scientist codenamed "The Enemy" built a new kind of bomb which,
if detonated, will kill eradicate the human race. The Strike Force Cobra,
an elite team of four commandos, must stop him. In order to do this, they
have to destroy the bomb, hidden in an underground laboratory. The lab consists
of four levels. The bomb is on level 4, the deepest one. You start on level 1.
To enter the bomb room, you need a 9-digit code. There are seven scientists
in the lab, all kidnapped by the Enemy. Each one knows one of the digits. The
two remaining ones can be cracked by your portable computers, but you need
to find all the others before you can do that. In short, then - make your way
to level 4 (it looks like a negative of a photo), enter the bomb room, shoot
the computer to open your way to the bomb, and destroy it with a few grenades.

And now for the creme de la creme... the pokes, that is.
Poke 48389,0 - will stop the timer.
Poke 48567,0 - will stop the energy decrease.

And the greatest treasure of them all:
Poke 46449,0 - go through walls, doors, and all other objects - including
               the enemies! Sometimes you may need to restore the previous
               state - use Poke 46449,32, and walls will be walls again.

Have fun! I did.

An ST version is in the works.

The aim of this game is to avenge the death of your father.  To to this you
have to enter the city of Zora.  Zora is the name of the guy who also
killed your father.  There are all sorts of bad guys, monsters, and traps
to get through.  You also have the pain of having to jump over barrels at
times during the game.  You will note, I am sure that the enemy don't have
to jump over the barrels.

The most impressive part of this game is the size of the characters and the
animation.  These characters look good!  The sound is appropriate and
excellent.  This is a hack & slay game.

You have a choice of a male or female, it doesn't seem to matter which you
chose, they both have the same capabilities.  The three basic manuvers are
hit high, hit medium height, hit low.  You also have the ability to dodge.

Pick up the small items you find for they will assist you in providing you
a smart bomb, magic shield and increase your hit points.  Be careful of the
traps.  It is quite a scene seeing your character impaled on a spike!

There is no time limit to complete this game, so take your time, except
when using magic that loses its effect after a period of time.

Try and not use your potions in the early portions of the game (those under
level 6).  You will need them more for the end game.

Some creatures can only be hit either at medium height or low height.  Some
men, like the giants require hitting at the high height for full impact and
damage.  

When barrels roll onto the screen, back off enough so you can jump the
barrel without having to deal with the fighter also.

The bridge section is very tough.  Be careful and watch ahead for patterns
of when the spikes come up.  Don't be afraid to "push" the enemy backward.

Level 1:  Go forward till you hear the guard speak to you.  Then move as
close to him as possible so you won't get hit by the spears.  Attack him
and continue till he and his cronies are dead.

Level 2:  Everyone tries to chase the guard and usualy get impailed on the
spikes.  Instead, just move forward into the space between the spikes.
Wait for him to approach you.  When he backs up, make sure he is far away
and then jump forward to the next space between the spikes.

Level 3:  When you use the overhead blow, the men will approach you, then
go to the kneeling blow and take them out.  Go after the giant with the
overhead blow and don't get too close or jump into him.

Level 4:  These guys are easy.  Just use the kneeling blows to take them
out.

Level 5:  Stay down!  Attack with the kneeling blow and you will avoid
their blows and slime attacks.

Level 6:  You can avoid the traps by using the SHIELD spell.  Attack the
man and follow him if he runs.

Level 7:  Walk to the right till you find you are even with the body on the
wall.  Kill the flying monsters with an overhead blow.  Then use the MAGIC
ZAPPER to kill the man.

Level 8:  Jump over the fire like you had to do with the logs.  Watch the
top of your screen and you will get a small warning when the ceiling is
going to fall down on you, then jump back.  When the steel spikes appear
the fire will quit.  Spend your time worrying about the spikes and ignore
the wall at this time.  

When you get to the lava pit, wait till the first block is almost at the
edge and jump forward onto it.  Do the same for the second block.

When you are on the third block, time you jump very carefully because the
floor will crumble if you jump too soon.  Keep it up till you reach the
stone skull.  Kick it and it will slide backwards.

Level 9:  Use the overhead blows to take out the first four monsters.  Jump
over the catipillar creature when its head is down.  Go past the potion and
you will see a bird follow you.  Now go back to the monster and the bird
will eat it.  When it is done, walk forwards till the water starts rising.

When the water is just below the birds mouth, jump.  Continue jumping till
the water is above the birds mouth.  The wall will now dissapear and you
can continue.

By the way, you can get more hit points by using the overhead blow and take
out the monsters that are on the wall.  Attack the fire balls.  The wall
will soon crumble.

Level 10:  Use the MAGIC ZAPPER when you first enter this level.  Then use
the SHIELD spell and jump forward to the man.  Hit him and jump to the
right.  

Level 11:  Take on the monster (hope your shield spell is still on) till he
dies.  Jump over the lightining bolts the wizard shoots at you.

Use MAGIC ZAPPERS twice on him and one SHIELD spell.  He can now be taken
out with 3-5 hits.  Continue to the right to your rightfull end.

SUNDOG HINTS.
Original author unknown.
* marks comments by Alex Leavans
** marks remarks by Bruce Webster, author of the original Sundog
Edited into shape from BIX messages by Neil Harris.


1. Character Generation

If you are going to make a try for solving Sundog, it's best to create a new
character.  When buying abilities, take a lot of Charisma and Luck...it helps
when avoiding the 'nasties' who plague the game.

** Actually, I prefer a high Dexterity--it'll help you with both space and
ground combat.  I usually set it at 70-75, Charisma at 60-65, and the rest in
the 50-60 range.


2. Use of Shunts

To conserve as many of your hard-earned credits as possible, replace all the
missing or broken pieces in your ship as possible with shunts.  Certain pieces
are un-shuntable, so some purchasing is necessary.

*  I have to disagree.  To get maximum performance, you want all the parts in
your ship to be of the highest quality. If you make do with shunts, you're
going to be in a much tougher situation if you need to run or fight.

** Use shunts. (Snicker)  Do it.  I dare you to.  It's a great way to commit
suicide.  Point 1:  each system has functions that disappear as it takes
damage and the overall level of the system drops. Using shunts pushes you
towards those lower levels.  Point 2: shunts are less than stable.  Want to
see something interesting? Take a particular system (such as ship's guns) and
load it up entirely with shunts (except, of course, for the control nodes).
Buy some cargo (so you'll be attacked), lift off, start a sub-light move to
the opposite side of the solar system, then run back to the guns repair bay
and wait for a pirate attack.  Then watch what happens.  _That'll_ cure you of
overusing shunts.


3. Auxiliary fuel

Now, fill up on fuel and repair your ship, but don't buy auxiliary fuel, as
this will take up space in your cargo hold.

** On the contrary, if you're a novice and not good at defending yourself
against pirates, you should _always_ buy aux fuel. It cuts into your profits,
true, but it beats the heck out of losing several thousand credits' worth of
ship's parts or just plain losing.  _I_ still buy aux fuel a lot, _especially_
if I'm going into dangerous territory, such as Woremed (see below).


4. Money in the bank

Take out all your money from the Bank.

* I disagree.  Take MOST of your money out of the bank (at least on Jondd, but
leave a couple of credits in the bank.

** I disagree.  If you're going to a specific system, use the Transfer
function to move lots of cash there.  But avoid carrying large sums of cash
any longer than you have to.  Few things more aggravating than withdrawing 50K
credits from the bank and immediately running into muggers who don't buy the
"Claim no cash" ploy.   Buy a lot of extra food (don't over-do it though) and
store it throughout the numerous lockers aboard your ship.


5. Weaponry

* One of the first purchases you should make is a shield and a  scattergun.
And, like it says in the ad, "Don't leave home  without them".

** Better yet--at least, at first--buy two or three shields (since you can get
them most anywhere) and forget the scattergun. Two shields in good shape will
let you outrun just about any group of attackers.  Be aware that each shield
can only take so many hits, just as a scattergun has only so many shots.  A
stinger is harder to use, but it never runs out of shots.


6. Fly to Woromed

Now you should Warp over to Woremed, where they have the best illegal
equipment credits can buy.  If you don't know how to warp yet, then don't use
these hints...get familiar with the game first.

** Actually, the best system to do wheeling and dealing in is Glory, since (1)
it has three planets to work with, and (2) it has a high law level, so pirate
attacks are less common than in other systems.

** A simple hints:  if you're going to Woremed, *don't* carry cargo. It's one
of the nastier system around.  Just take (or transfer) some cash, go there,
buy what you need, and leave.


7. What to buy on Woromed

Once on Woremed, peek in the Bank and see if there is any more dough stashed
there...a litle more money couldn't hurt. Find a bar, and ask the bartender
for Information about Buying a Cloaker and then a Ground Scanner.  Replace a
Cryofuse in the force shield with the Cloaker, and replace a Scanner in
Pilotage with the Ground Scanner.  The Ground scanner lets you see a few
cities missing from your maps as well as land directly at them (rather than
having to drive around in your little land cruiser, ne' pod), and the Cloaker
makes you invisible when the cloaker is activated.

** I seldom buy a cloaker; I prefer concentrators and autoslews, so that I can
entertain myself with blowing the pirates away.  Better use of fuel, though
you do run the risk of damage.

*  Another device that you will want to have is a DeCloaker. This negates the
effects of other people's (namely pirates) cloakers.  This device is available
in a bar in the city of Banville (which is the religious colony that you are
supplying.)  You'll have to wait until the colony gets sufficiently developed
for the bar to appear (it's the purple building that looks kinda like a moldy
moon pie...), but once it does, buy that DeCloaker!  The DeCloaker replaces a
j-junc module in the tactical display.

*  A second note:  I've found that it's a really useful idea to buy TWO of
each of the items-->ground scanner, cloaker, and decloaker.  Install one of
each of the devices where they belong (don't worry about putting them in
wrong, they won't fit anywhere except where they're supposed to go).  Now put
your spares in the parts locker.  This will save your buns at some future date
when a pirate blows out one of your hard to obtain and very expensive parts.
And believe me, it's gonna happen.  It's better to spend credits NOW, when
you're in the right spot, and can get what you need, than be stuck later,
without what you need.

** (Snicker)  Ever noticed how often those special, illegal, expensive
components seem to blow when you're attacked?  A real shame, isn't it?  I not
only keep spares, I take the darned things out when they're not in use.  Why
risk a ground scanner during an in-system transit? You can *always* land at
the starport, plug the GS back in, then go to the city of your choice.


8. Explore the planet

Start your wheelings and dealings on Woremed...might as well, since you happen
to be there already. Buy as much as you can, and fly to another city by
selecting Navigate and choosing City To City.  Sell, everything you have,
because this is the only way for you to get credits to finance your mission.
(Of course, the old capitalistic creed applies--buy low and sell high!)  Check
to see if the warehouse has any Cryogens, and take note of whatever else is
there too.  Don't buy any goods now, but collect the Cryogens and take them
back to Jondd.  One of your last actions should be to to pick up all the cash
that is left on Woremed...there are other means of banking, but direct cash
transactions are easier and less bothersome.

** Don't take all the cash; it's usually a good idea to leave a little on each
system for emergencies.  And the best way to get it back to Jondd is to use
the TRANSFER function at the Uniteller.

If you don't take your dough with you, then you won't have anything at all
back on Jondd.  REMEMBER! When you buy or sell something at the exchange, the
cash is deposited to the bank, and NOT to you personally.  So be sure and
withdraw all your cash before you leave!

* Be careful, though!  Carrying large amounts of cash on you is a good way to
attract muggers!  If  you get the little blue box that shows someone is
approaching you, run for it! You have better than a 50% chance of getting
away.  I have never met anyone yet in those encounters that meant me any good.
(Mind you, some of them didn't actually do me any harm, but...).  If you get
stopped by  muggers, bluff.  Claim no cash.  About 2/3rds of the time, this
works, and you get left alone.  If they attack, run for it.  That's what you
bought your shield for.  (It only takes a limited number of hits, though, so
be careful not to get complacent).  If there are only a few of them, you can
choose to duke it out.  This is where a scattergun becomes important.  A
stinger won't do much of anything.  A scattergun will level your attackers
much more easily.  Search your attackers, as they will sometimes be carrying
things of value.

** A scattergun only has 7 shots, while a stinger has an unlimited number.  If
you want to go picking fights, the best combo is two shields, a scattergun,
and a stinger.  Keep the scattergun in your hand (upper right location); when
it runs out, it'll automatically switch to your stinger.


9. Back to Jondd

Once you get back to Jondd, buy a LOT of food, which you will need while
travelling in the wilderness.  Leave Drahew, and hunt around for 'The Lost
Colony', known as Banville Center. Once found, your Ground Scanner will store
its position in memory, and you will be able to land there directly.  Visit
their warehouse, and find out which goods they need. Remember to store your
cryogens there, too. From here on, it's just a matter of finding where the
goods Banville Center needs are.  Just keep flying around picking up
credits and the needed goods.


10. Evading Pirates

However, a certain 'low class' element also roams the spaceways...pirates!
When faced with pirates (you will hear the alarm, believe me) select Tactical.
The least damaging (to you) method of dealing with the buccaneers of the
spaceways is to wait for them to close in (your ship is moving...remember
that) and try to Communicate.  Refuse to deal with them, and Bluff.  This
usually doesn't work, so if not, select Cloaker from the menu, which will make
you effectively invisible.   When the pirates reach the center of the screen,
they will warp off; now shut off the Cloaker as fast as possible...its a real
gas guzzler.  The pirates will leave you alone if your cargo hold is empty, or
carrying cryogens.

*  Also, remember: while you're in sublight, from planet to warp point or vice
versa, your warp drives can be charging. This means that once you hit the warp
point, you can just blast off, leaving the pirates in the dust.

** Actually, if you want to really be tricky, you can fully charge your warp
engines while sitting on the ground--then run over to the fuel depot and "top
off" your tanks.  Also, did you know that you can warp any time after leaving
orbit?  That little number in the upper left corner of the pilotage shows you
the probability of making a successful warp at that moment.  If it works, you
arrive at your target system, but your location will vary to either side of
where you were at when you jumped, with a greater variation for being more
"in-system".  If it doesn't work, you have to select a destination and start
the warp engines charging all over again.

*  With the cloaker on, some pirates will wander off of your tactical display.
A good rule of thumb is, if you can't see  them, they can't see you.  Some
pirates (most notably the larger vessels) will NOT go away.  They will fly
right up to you and stay on you.  AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR CLOAKER ON, THEY
WON'T FIRE.  This makes for some interesting situations, when you're low on
fuel, and coming up on a planet...

* Because the only time you can get nailed by pirates is while moving planet
to planet or warp point, choose your warp points with care.  Use the maps, and
figure out EXACTLY where you want to go to.  Then pick the shortest route....

** Different systems have different law levels.  The lower the law level in
the system, the greater the probability of being attacked (on the ground or in
space).  In a system with a low law level (like Woremed), you want to either
avoid carrying cargo or choose the most direct route possible.  In a system
with a high law level (like Glory), it's not so critical to be direct.  Also,
in a multi-planet system, you can use the planets as stepping stones.


11. Fighting Pirates

If you are the more agressive type, and hate to see these pirates walk all
over you, then you'll want to pick up on Woremed a Concentrator and an
Autoslew.

* The concentrator is available at the same bar(s) on Woremed that all the
other stuff is.  I STILL haven't found an Autoslew.

Put the Concentrator in your gun panel, and the Autoslew in the tactical
panel.  However, pirates don't work alone as a rule, but you do...they have
the advantage on number, so don't push your luck.  If you feel like a fight
once in a while, then go ahead, but don't make it a habit (unless you happen
to be Buck Rogers, Luke Skywalker, or Han Solo).

** Heck, I _like_ fighting pirates.  In a number of systems, you can get
bounties (of up to 5000 Cr) for blowing a pirate away.  Better yet, cargo will
often be detected in the wreckage, and you can use the tractor beam to bring
it into the pod...*if* you have a free slot.  If you don't, you can always
jettison what's there, but you don't have long to make that decision, and you
won't know 'til you bring it on board what you've got.

** By the way, as you destroy or chase off pirates in a given system, you gain
a "reputation" which makes them less likely to attack you.

** If you want to fight, this is also a good time to pop a dexboost. That'll
up your DX to 100 (temporarily) and make it easier to hit those suckers.
Weapons preference is a matter of personal choice; I prefer lasers and have
enough experience (I wrote the $*#&$ code) with it to defend myself.

13. Shields

*  It also takes a couple of seconds for your shields to charge--so when
you're flying in space with valuable cargo, first thing to do, after you've
selected your sublight destination (and possibly warp point), is to put up
those shields!

** A waste of fuel.  I usually don't put up my shields until I hear the alarm
or see the attack indicator (upper left corner of the pilotage) turn red.  If
I'm feeling nervous, I'll sit in the TACTICAL display, in the SHIELDS menu,
ready to hit the SHIELDS FULL button should I be attacked.  Sometimes, though,
I won't even put up the shields until *after* I've done a COMM with the
pirates.


14. Colonies & Trade Goods (see list at end of article)

* One thing is almost certain--if you need it for the colony, then you won't
be able to buy it on Jondd.

** Actually, in a given game, each planet has a list of supply and demand
values for all the trade goods--and no planet has (to my recollection) all of
them available.  Supply and demand is modelled on a city-by-city basis, but
each city tends to recover towards the planetary levels.  There are 18
different sets of values, and they are randomly distributed among the planets
at the start of a new game.  For that matter, more often than not, you can
complete the first phase of construction in Banville without ever leaving
Jondd (or, at least, without leaving the system).  Which, of course, is a
great way to eat up your "seed" money.

** Each solar system has three levels:  law, tech, and wealth.  Law affects
frequency of attack (in space and on the ground) and also affects what illegal
items are available in bars.  Note, though, that it is possible to be offered,
say, a ground scanner on Jondd by someone in the street.  However, you have to
be willing to endure beggars and muggers for quite a while to find something
like that.

** The tech level affects the price of tech-based trade goods (I leave it as
an exercise to the reader to figure out which goods are tech-based). It also
affects the range of ship's parts available in the stores.

** The wealth level has a general impact on the price of goods but that's just
one in a series of factors determining what the cost of a particular cargo is
(along with supply, demand, quality, tech level, and whether or not you're in
a starport).  Want a measure of a system's wealth level?  Buy a glass of ale
and look at the price.

** For those of you who thought you were going nuts:  yes, some of the planets
actually move during the course of the game.


15. Needs and the Pod

* Make your list of items currently needed by the colony.  Fly around Jondd to
the various cities, and if you see something at a good price, BUY IT.  You
don't know when (or if) you'll see it again.  First thing to do is store it in
the pod.  If it won't fit because you've already got stuff there, store it in
the warehouse, and come back for it after you've dropped off your current
load. If the various cities on Jondd don't have what you need, the next
alternative is to try Heavy.  This is a local flight, but don't let that fool
you--pirates are as ready to hassle you here as anywhere.  A good strategy is
to fly to Heavy, pick up one of the items you need, which will fill one space
in your pod's cargo bay.  Use the other space for a load of fuel.  Fill up
your ship at the spaceport, so that what you have is a full tank, and then a
reserve tank (in the pod).  (By the way, I assume you've bought a cloaker...)
Now, fly back to Jondd.  It's almost certain that a pirate is gonna bother
you.  The reason for the extra fuel, is so that when you hit 'Cloak' you don't
have to worry about being stranded in space, out of fuel.  (Which will make
you a sitting and very dead duck).  Leave your cloaker on until you hit Jondd,
then simply go to Navigate, and land at the colony.  Don't bother turning off
your shields or cloaker--the landing sequence will do that automatically. The
key issue is to avoid getting hit by the pirates--so leave your shields up!

*  When buying things at the exchange, don't necessarily buy something the
first time you see it.  Quite often the same item, but of varying quality,
will be offered for sale more than once.  When buying for yourself, (i.e., to
make a profit), buy the highest quality available  (I generally don't buy
below a 'C').  When buying for the colony, buy the LOWEST grade of merchandise
possible. [I try not buy above a 'E']. (They will accept anything, and what's
the point of paying 10,000  credits for grade 'A' gems/crystals, when you can
buy grade 'G' for 3500 and keep the extra 6500 yourself?).  Anyway, at any
given exchange at any given time there are only about 8 or 10 things that are
for sale, and they cycle through the list. Don't be scared about missing
something, and so buying it the first time you see it.  Often, the same item
(different grade) will come up a few items later, so cycle through everything
before you make your purchases.  This can often save you credits!


16. Hints & Tips

*  The only safe places to sleep are a hotel, your ship, and your pod.
Sleeping in a bar is a good way to get robbed of everything on you!  Your pod,
also, can be ransacked.  This may happen if you park it on the street, or in
an unguarded parking space. Guarded parking lots (the ones with spaces and a
little white guard building) are safe.

*  There will be certain planetary systems that you can't get to, initially.
THIS IS NOT A BUG IN THE GAME.  There is a way to solve this problem.  But it
will cost you money, a lot of money.  In sum, 200,000 credits.  So DON'T get
to the end of the game with a small amount of money, because you will NEED
lots of capital to finish the game.  So sharpen up those trade skills!

** For those of you wonder how the score is calculated and what it means:
don't ask me.  That was added for the ST version, and I haven't figured it
out, either.

Note:  Some  aspects  of the endgame defy mapping. The direction from which
you  enter  a  'desert' or 'foothills' location may affect your destination
when you leave; enter a desert 'room' from the North, then go north and you
MIGHT  enter  the Tower. But if you entered the desert from the East, going
north  might  take  you  to  a  different place! You should drop an uneeded
object in each of these locations so you'll know when you've returned there
unexpectedly.  Even  if  you do get lost, it's easy to take a few steps and
reach a reliable location.

                                    General

                              Typed by Golden One

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I, Lord British, write this exhortation in my own hand that you, my virtuous
Champion and Avatar, might gain a full appreciation of the significance of the
times which face us.  Though evil has often raised its rebellion head, I fear
we now face a threat far greater than any yet encountered.  In the past, you
and your companions have risen faithfully to the challenge, undaunted by
overwhelming odds, unwavering in your adherence to the Path of Virtue.  We
place our trust in you once more.

As though seeking vengeance against the Light, the forces of Darkness have
renewed their malevolent aggressions.  Not content to remain in their own
realm, daemonic emissaries from the Underworld have begun making incursions
into our land.  It is fortuitous that you have returned to Britannia in these
perilous times.  Study well the words which follow, for they are essential to
your quest.  And that quest is essential to the continued existence of the
human race.

For more than a fortnight I have dictated my thoughts and admonitions to the
venerable Moebius, Keeper of the Libraries of the Lycaeum.  He has
scrupulously recorded my every word, and when called upon, made illustrations
to aid your understanding.  I have affixed my seal to this letter to assure
you that these are indeed my words.  Take them to heart.  Heed my counsel.

Gird yourself with the infinite wisdom of Truth, Love and Courage, for at the
end of your quest lies a destiny foretold in ancient times:  "One shall arise
who possesses the strength of an army, the vision of a prophet and the heart
of a saint.  This Great One will bring an end to the struggle between the
Darkness and the Light."

Pray that you are, indeed, the One, for should you fail, the Light of life
will surely be extinguished and Darkness will reign forevermore.

Lord British
Sovereign of Britannia



THE CHRONICLES OF BRITANNIA

My sojourn upon the shores of Britannia began many generations ago.  Long ago
did I uncover the secrets of the moongates which brought me here from my
distant homeland, even as they now bring you.  As you well know, we who pass
through the gates to Britannia, though we be in this world are not of it.  It
is for this reason, I suspect, that we are immune to the ravages of time
during our stays here.  Remember, however, that we remain ever mortal, albeit
seemingly ageless.

At the time of my arrival here, this place was known as Sosaria, a region
comprised of numerous warring city-states and feudal fiefdoms.  It was not
long before my affinity for order, peace and prosperity had earned me the
title of Lord British, ruler over the city-state of Britain, and ultimately
Lord of Britannia.  Under my guidance the land and its people have prospered
and grown, though not without challenges from the forces of Evil.

THE AGE OF DARKNESS AND THE FOUNDING OF BRITANNIA

Thrice during ancient times did beings of a foul nature seek to conquer my
domain.  Thrice did you answer my call for a champion.  Thrice was evil
thwarted.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA I

First was the perverted sorceror, Mondain, who slew his own father that he
might gain immortality and advance his dark dominion over the land.  It was
against Mondain that you first answered my call, travelling through the
moongate to put an end to Mondain's shadowy plans.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA II

The triumph of good was short-lived, for Mondain left behind an apprentice and
consort named Minax, a cold-blooded young woman whose ambition was exceeded
only by her thrist for blood.  Entire legions of evil creatures responded to
her commands, bringing misery to the inhabitants of Sosaria.  Again, you rose
to the challenge, slaying Miinax's vile minions by the hundreds until at last
she too met her fate at your hands.

THE TALE OF ULTIMA III

Mondain and Minax had devised a treacherous scheme to assure their immortality
throughout time.  They had created an offspring known as Exodus, neither man
nor machine, yet embodying every evil impulse they possessed.  Rising from the
murky depths of the Great Ocean, Exodus unleashed an assault of vengeance upon
the world.  Were it not for your keen wit and determination, Exodus would
surely have brought utter devastation to our land.  Aided by the enigmatic
Timelord, you foiled the mighty Exodus, bringing an end to the Cycle of Gloom
begun by Mondain so long ago.

In this manner did you thrice respond to my call for valor and overcome the
Triad of Evil.  The peace and security brought about by your acts of bravery
led the city-states to band together and form the nation of Britannia,
submitting to my just rule as British, Lord of Britannia.

THE ASCENT OF THE AVATAR,
as Related in Ultima IV

With the passing of gloom and despair from the face of Britannia, the citizens
flourished.  Edicts went forth from my hand which were designed to foster both
the material and spiritual growth of the society.  I established great centers
of learning where the arts and sciences could be developed and appreciated.
During this era of renaissance, eight major townships were built upon the
foundations of the former city-states, each dedicated to the study and
fostering of a single virtue.  These towns stand as symbols of great fortitude
to this day.

All great cultural movements require role models to help society maintain
proper focus.  I therefore issued the challenge for such an individual to step
forward and show the people the way of virtue.  You responded in a fashion
which befits your integrity and pure heart.  Undertaking the task of
unraveling the concepts of spirituality, you discovered the great Codex of
Ultimate Wisdom and attained the title of 'Avatar,' the human embodiment of
virtue.

The newly discovered Codex was raised from the bottom of the Great Stygian
Abyss in order that we might study its teachings.  But our acquisition of the
Codex changed the physical, as well as the spiritual, landscape of the world.
A fiery new island, the Isle of the Avatar, rose from the depths of the Great
Sea, and in the violent birth of this isle, an immense underworld chamber
opened up!  When this cataclysm had passed, a shrine was built on the Isle of
the Avatar to house the Codex forever.

THE SUBVERSION OF THE SHADOWLORDS,
as Related in Ultima V

The acquisition of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom from the deep recesses of the
underworld created a karmic imbalance in the universe, resulting in the
emergence of three sinister Shadowlords from the shards of the black jewel of
Mondain.  These grim agents of darkness were the very antitheses of virtue.
Their trickery and deceit allowed them to imprison me in their underworld
dungeon and, in a perversion of justice, compelled the leaders of Britannia to
oppress the people.  The once noble Lord Blackthorn became the human agent who
fulfilled their evil intent.

However, following your instincts and the admonitions of the Codex, you
applied the principles of truth, love and courage against the Shadowlords and
the corrupted Blackthorn.  Your efforts allowed me to banish them and their
agents from the realm of light.  Thus was I restored to my consecrated throne.

However, my return to the surface world set off a great tectonic upheaval,
resulting in the collapse of the cavernous underworld in which I had been
imprisoned.  Many aftershocks and cataclysmic disasters befell the world for a
period of time after that, though eventually all was restored to normal.

TODAY:  THE THREAT OF THE GARGOYLES

Though long believed to be mythological creatures, the existence of Gargoyles
was discovered shortly after the first expedition to the geologically unstable
underworld.  At first, they seemed content to remain in their subterranean
domain, but recently they began appearing in our world, seemingly bent on
doing us great harm.

These diabolical nemeses have begun to seize our holy shrines and places of
enlightenment.  Scores of homes and villages in our land have been destroyed
during nocturnal raids mounted by the daemonic fiends, while countless others
stand empty and deserted.  Local and government militias have organized in
opposition to the calamitous invasion from below.  Whole brigades of skilled
warriors from Serpent's Hold have clashed with these tireless foes on the
field of battle, but to no avail.

The Gargoyles' methods suggest that they are searching for something of great
value.  It is even rumored that they may seek your destruction, though why
this should be so is not known to us.

I urge you, my Champion and Avatar, to study the pages that follow, in part to
ensure your own survival.  But even more, heed my words that you may
understand the condition of our world and the plight of our people against the
unrelenting Gargoyles.



THE KINGDOM OF BRITTANIA

As the Lord of Britannia, I have devoted myself to fathoming the beauty and
variety of this land.  But one must not forget that the landscape has been
stained with the blood of many a brave warrior who, for want of control over
it, fell victim to its perils.  Those who have seen the Bloody Plains in the
northeast know of what I speak.  So, take care in your journeying lest you
fall prey to the seductive charm of the land, only to learn its deadly secrets
while lost in contemplation.

THE GREAT CENTERS OF POWER AND LEARNING

The Castle of Lord British
Chief among the places in Britannia, my keep overlooks the town of Britain
from the protected flanks of the Serpent's Spine.  Visitors to the castle will
find evidence of my many interests and hobbies within its marbled halls.

Though my authority extends from the throne to the most remote regions of the
kingdom, none shall be turned away who come to me for counsel in their time of
need.  And forget not, Avatar, that I have prepared a room for you in my
castle that you might find a place of rest from your long journeys abroad.

The Lycaeum
The world's greatest storehouse of knowledge and wisdom is contained within
the walls that form the Lycaeum.  Poised upon the northwestern slopes of
Verity Isle, the Lycaeum's libraries, laboratories and academies of learning
are a haven for the seeker of truth.  Four times each year the Inner Circle of
Mages congregates within the labyrinthine chambers to exchange esoteric
secrets.  Whilst in the area, do not fail to visit the observatory where
astronomers create many fine lenses through which to view the heavens.

Empath Abbey
Home to the Brotherhood of the Rose, Empath Abbey serves as a retreat for
those engaged in contemplation and reflection.  Flanked by the oaks of the
Deep Forest on one side and by the sea on the other, the Abbey sits as a
lighthouse of peace in the northwestern region of Britannia, near the town of
Yew.  Well schooled in the vintner's craft, the brothers and sisters of the
Abbey produce some of the land's finest wines, thus assuring their financial
security and sustaining their monastic lifestyles.

Serpent's Hold
A bastion of honor, valor, and triump, Serpent's Hold is the castle
headquarters of the Order of the Silver Serpent and the training center for
Britannia's armed militia.  Many noble and brave warriors have set forth in
our defense from this garrison on the Isle of Deeds.  The most skilled of
these warriors, grizzled veterans all, have selflessly returned to instruct
the new recruits in the ways of attack and defense.  Recently, a dozen squads
of the finest from Serpent's Hold went out to attack the camps of the invading
Gargoyles.  Few returned to tell about it.

THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS

When the Great Council met after the collapse of the Triad of Evil, it was
decided that each of the main towns of Britannia should adopt one of the
fundamental principles of virtue as its focus of learning.  Each of these
eight towns, the former city-states of Sosaria, has taken great care in
fostering its guiding principle of virtue--they stand apart as the true jewels
in the crown of Britannia.  The traveller will find a sacred shrine dedicated
to the chosen principle of virtue near each town.

Moonglow, founded on Honesty
On the southern tip of Verity Isle, the town of Moonglow welcomes those of
faithful heart and noble intentions.  Mages and scholars frequent this
seagoing port because of its proximity to the libraries of the Lycaeum and
because its accomodations and services are among the most reasonably priced in
the land.

Britain, founded on Compassion
Centrally located on the shore of Britanny Bay, the town of Britain is the
site of the castle from which I rule.  It is also host to multitudes of
travellers and to purveyors of goods of all kinds.

The adventurer will surely appreciate the hospitality shown by Britain's
compassionate citizens.  The shops, inns and armouries of Britain are much
renowned and frequented by all who prepare for and return from long journeys.
The historic Wayfarer's Inn is considered a second home to many a road-weary
adventurer.

Jhelom, founded on Valor
Many of Britannia's most esteemed warriors have emerged from the town of
Jhelom in the far southwestern region of the kingdom on the main island of the
Valorian isles.  Lodging, supplies, armaments and a prosperous shipbuilding
industry are to be found in this bustling town by the sea.

Yew, founded on Justice
Second in size only to Britain, the town of Yew is the judicial and legal
heart of the kingdom, being home to the Supreme Court of Britannia.  Druids
and philosophers have long gathered under the shade trees of the Deep Forest
surrounding Yew, exploring the subtle nuances of justice and righteousness.
While visiting Yew, one will find a fine pub and a fully equipped armoury and
apothecary.

Minoc, founded on Sacrifice
Stretched across the mouth of Lost Hope Bay in northern Britannia, Minoc has
commited itself to the plight of the needy and homeless.  Minoc is also well
known for its artisans who excel in the crafts of metalworking, armouring,
glassworking, and clock making.

Trinsic, founded on Honor
The honorable paladins who make their homes in the idyllic town of Trinsic are
noted for their courage and devotion to truth.  Situated just north of the
Cape of Heroes in the south lands, Trinsic provides many fine goods and
services to the traveller, including a stable where the finest steeds are
available to speed you along your way.

Skara Brae, founded on Spirituality
It has oft been said that Skara Brae, close by the mystic forest of
Spiritwood, is the spiritual center of Britannia.  But the word "spirit" has
many meanings, and only some of the town's inhabitants--notably the healers,
magicians, and priests--concern themselves with matters of the soul.  Others
in the area have a different meaning in mind--those inclined to take advantage
of Skara Brae's fine winery!

New Magincia, founded on Humility
Having been destroyed in ancient times for its haughty pride, New Magincia was
rebuilt by a more humble people who favored the simple ways of farming and
rural life.  With the passage of time, an industrious village has grown atop
the ruins of the old town.  Those who would revel in their own pride should
take special note of the lesson of New Magincia.

OTHER LOCATIONS OF NOTE

Buccaneer's Den
Lives there a soul who has not heard of the notorious pirates and thieves of
Buccaneer's Den?  In spite of its ill repute, many travellers have found this
island village east of Paws to be a great source of exotic goods.  The ships
that frequent its harbor bring unusual artifacts from far and wide.

Cove
Nestled in the mountains just south of Lost Lake, Cove is home to many
magicians, healers and alchemists.  One will also find there a shrine
dedicated to the Avatar's pursuit of Virtue.

Paws
This quaint coastal village lies halfway between the towns of Britain and
Trinsic, where the weary traveller can obtain food, shelther and a change of
horse.  The mysterious islands known as the Fens of the Dead can barely be
seen offshore near Paws.  In these Fens, mages ofttimes seek the rare mandrake
root and nightshade so necessary to their potent concoctions.

The Bloody Plains
Site of one of Britannia's most savage wars, this desolate region lies
sandwiched between two great swamps across the mountains northeast of the
village of Cove.  The bloodstained soil serves as a timeless memorial to the
thousands of brave soldiers who met their fate there.  Mages know this area as
another of the few paces where they can find mandrake root and nightshade.

The Isle of the Avatar
This enigma of nature rose from the sea when the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom was
brought up from the depths of the Great Stygian Abyss.  The great subterranean
upheaval that gave it birth left the large island dotted with volcanic
craters, steaming fumaroles, and a ready supply of sulfurous ash.  Few are
brave enough to risk the hazards of this place--even to behold the Codex in
the Shrine of the Avatar.

The Palace of Blackthorn
Few nowadays venture near this monument to evil, but rumors abound that the
mad wizard Sutek has taken refuge in the former abode of Blackthorn, the
defamed ally of the vanquished Shadowlords.  What Sutek might be doing there,
none can say.



THE CITIZENRY

The citizens of Britannia are a diverse people who have survived many
challenges to the rule of Order.  Their ancestry can be traced to a time
before the Sosarian city-states were formed, a time when a loose confederation
of druids and mages flourished alongside a meek but industrious agricultural
populace.  Relics of ancient times can be found throughout the land and traces
of the ancient language of the land can be found throughout modern Britannia.

In your travels you will no doubt come upon the occasional sign or placard
written in a curious runic script.  Passed down from one generation to the
next, this written runic language is directly descended from the language of
the druids of old.  Though strange and seemingly indecipherable, the process
of interpreting runic script is really quite simple.  The key (ULT6LANG.DOC)
will enable the traveller to translate runic characters into his native
tongue.

INTERACTING WITH THE CITIZENS

Whether talking to the farmer in his field or to one of the scholars at the
Lycaeum, one will be impressed with the eloquence and diversity of interests
possessed by the people of Britannia.  Their good-natured dispositions are a
result of several generations of relative peace brought about by the natural
focus on the principles of Virtue.

When meeting someone for the first time, it is customary to ask them their
name and job.  In most cases, a Britannian will be more than willing to
discuss a variety of subjects and be most eager to answer questions you may
post to him.  Do not fail to take note of the things you are told during these
coversations, for even the words of the humblest farmer or beggar may provide
needed guidance in your journey through the land.

Many Britannians will do far more than offer advice and information, however.
If asked to join your party, the more adventuresome in the realm will
accompany you on your quest.  Stalwart allies can mean the difference between
victory and defeat, so choose your party members wisely.

Merchants buy and sell a variety of goods and services, offering you the
opportunity to stock up on needed supplies or build up cash reserves.  Enter a
shop and tell the proprietor you wish to buy something and you will very
likely find the item you desire.  Offer to sell the proprietor an object in
your possession and you may find him an eager trading partner.

The commerce of the nation is a source of pride to all Britannians and a
subject worthy of detailed treatment here.

COMMERCE

A complex system of interdependency among many professions and crafts drives
all commercial activity in Britannia.  This interdependency ensures that
Britannia remains a growing nation, well supplied and prepared against times
of shortage and hardship.

Farming
Since the times before our great societal expansion, farming and animal
husbandry have been the cornerstones of the Britannian economy.  It is the
farmer who grows fine grains for the baker and the baker who makes our bread.
It is the rancher who tends the cattle for meat and dairy products, keeping
our stores and pubs filled with the necessities of life.  In like manner, the
shepherd supplies wool to the makers of cloth who, in turn, enable the
clothiers to ply their trade.  In these and many other ways, Britannian owes
its livelihood to the persistent laborers of the soil.

PROFESSIONAL MERCHANTS

The merchants of Britannia strive to provide satisfactory goods and services
to their customers.  The professional symbols emblazoned upon the signs which
hang outside their shops attest to their willingness to assist the traveller..
at least during business hours.

Armouries (Serpent)
Britannia's armouries are a key factor in the security and prosperity of the
land.  Providing both armaments for the valiant and employment for armourers
and blacksmiths, these shops offer high quality armour and weaponry of many
types.  Most armourers will gladly repurchase used equipment, though usually
at prices far lower than originally paid for them.

Stables (Horseshoe)
The seasoned traveller understands what a godsend a steed can be on lengthy
and treacherous journeys.  Stables are usually found in smaller towns and
villages, or at private residences where the owners may be willing to offer
you a fine horse at a fair price.

Markets & Pubs (Mug and Bowl)
Most of the major towns in Britannia have at least one shop dedicated to
caring for the traveller's need for food and supplies.  The wise traveller
will learn to examine the varied inventories carried by different merchants,
making note of the shopkeepers who stock rare and unusual items--one never
knows when such knowledge may be of use.  In pubs, the traveller may partake
of a refreshing glass of ale or a fine meal of pheasant and mutton.  The
service will often be accompanied by the melodies of a cheerful minstrel, and
pub owners are known for their willingness to take part in a friendly chat.

Healers (Ankh)
The vast wildernesses of Britannia, though rich in beauty, also hold hidden
dangers capable of causing travellers injury or illness.  Luckily, many towns
have professional people trained in the medicinal arts.  Healers can turn back
the ravages of swamp poison or heal wounds earn in battle.  Some physicians
claim that their healing arts have been enhanced and augmented by magic, to
the point that they can resurrect the dead!

Magic shops (Vial)
These occult apothecaries are quite interesting to visit.  Their oddly
decorated shelves are often strewn with vials of strangely colored potions,
queerly glowing staves and scepters, and a cornucopia of herbal and mineral
reagents useful in the mage's work.  since many of the items offered are both
rare and expensive, their availability will vary from town to town, so the
travelling mage will want to make special note of those things offered in the
places he visits.

Inns (Candle)
Inns provide safe, restful accomodations where travellers can retreat after a
long, hard day.  Many inns even offer fine dining facilities on-site.  Prices
will vary from place to place, but even the most inexpensive inn is a welcome
home away from home for the weary adventurer.

Shipwrights (Anchor)
Several of the port towns along the shores of Britannia boast of craftsmen
renowned for their dedication to the construction of safe, dependable sea
vessels.  Whether you need a small skiff to get upriver, or a mighty sailing
vessel for open sea travel, the local shipwrights will be more than happy to
discuss terms.  It is wise to pay attention to information about local sea and
wind conditions before setting out in a new craft.

Guilds (Key)
It is not uncommon for members of certain professions to organize themselves
into guilds which cater to the specific needs of their membership.  Such
guilds have been set up in a number of towns.  The guilds provide professional
adventurers with many of the things they need for journeys into the wilderness
and deep dungeons.

Tailors (Scissors)
Nowhere is the interdependence of Britannia's craftspeople more in evidence
that in the field of tailoring.  Thread must be spun and taken to weavers.
Weavers, having made cloth from the thread, deliver it into the hands of
clothiers.  Clothiers turn bolts of fine fabric into clothes fit for kings.
Find your place in this process and you may profit.  Seek out the tailors of
Paws if you desire a wardrobe of the highest quality.

Fletchers & Bowyers (Arrow)
Many are the fletchers and bowyers of Britannia, but none are held in higher
esteem than those of the town of Britain.  The ingenious engineering and high
quality of their arrows, bolts, bows, and crossbows is known through the land.
This is due mainly to the great skill of the master bowyer, Iolo Fitzowen,
proprietor of Iolo's Bows.  Iolo and his apprentice, Gwenneth, can be of great
assistance to archers.



THE CALL TO ADVENTURE

Adventuring in the savage lands of Britannia is no life for the timid, nor is
it a profession for those lacking resolve.  Consider carefully before taking
up the gauntlet I cast before you, for the path to your destiny is fraught
with peril and adversity.  The elite corps of stout-hearted souls who accept
my challenge must be disciplined, determined and willing to sacrifice all.
But even more, they must be devout followers of the path of virtue.  Learn now
the ways in which my chosen adventurers apply their talents to the tasks
before them.

THE WAY OF THE FIGHTER

Many celebrated fighters are trained in the art of combat at Serpent's Hold.
There are, however, a few warriors of humble origin who have not the benefit
of such training.  These acquire skills on the field of battle, earning high
acclaim for heroic deeds of valor.  The true value of a fighter is found not
in his training, but in his heart; it is exemplified not in his knowledge, but
in his accomplishments.

The fighter typically possesses great strength and endurance, complements to
his natural instincts and boundless courage.  His proficiency with many
weapons makes him a walking arsenal, ever ready for battle.  The fighter
prefers to mount his attack from the front line position, a strategy which
well serves his inclination to wield mighty bludgeoning weapons and lethal
two-handed swords.

As a novice fighter grows in experience, his strength and dexterity naturally
increase, allowing him to employ more effective combinations of weapons and
armour.  Enjoying the company of rangers and paladins, the fighter should
likewise associate himself with a mage or a bard who can supplement his great
physical attack with long range weaponry and the tools of magic.

THE WAY OF THE BARD

Poet and minstrel, tinkerer and athlete, user of magic and noble adventurer...
These all describe the multi-talented bard.  Though not as physically imposing
as the fighter, the bard is usually more dextrous and agile, being both quick
of mind and of foot.  Sure hands and nimble fingers serve the bard well as he
untagles knotty puzzles and picks "unpickable" locks.

Often an accomplished archer, the bard is also acquainted with the ways of
magic, making him a most versatile gladiator on the field of battle.  He often
chooses to aply his combative skills from the rear of the melle where he can
let his arrows and fiery magic missiles fly toward beleaguered targets in the
front.  Whether in the heat of battle or in the quagmire of a wizard's
mischievous riddle, the well-rounded bard is an indispensable ally to the
adventurer's quest.

THE WAY OF THE MAGE

All well-travelled adventurers have at one time or another been mystified by
the mages of Britannia.  Never to be forgotten is the sight of a cloaked
figure performing an odd dance in a distant clearing.  Puzzling indeed is the
whispered transaction between a mage and an apothecary as the magician
acquires the plants and animal parts that are the raw materials of his trade.

Seeing what cannot be seen, hearing what no man hears, communing with beings
not present... What ancient spirit possesses the mage that his mind constantly
dwells on things not perceived by the common man?

One never chooses to become a mage--one is born a mage, having from birth
exhibited magical inclinations and abilities which defy rational explanation.
A mage usually spends his early years studying the esoteric writings and
diagrams contained in the libraries of the Lycaeum or poring over bottles and
boxes of exotic herbs and minerals found in its laboratories.

The tools and weapons of the mage are found in his spellbook, which never
leaves his side.  This tome is filled with pages of cryptic runes which
descripbe the auspicious times, places and methods for various types of
sorcerous work.  The illusions and spells at the mage's command often cast him
in the role of equalizer when a party of adventurers finds itself in an
otherwise one-side conflict against a megalithic foe.  From a well-protected
position at the edge of the battle, the mage makes the necessary preparations
and utters the mysterious incantations to unleash the force of his chosen
spells against an unsuspecting foe.

Certain skilled mages possess remarkable power over nature and matter, being
able to create and destroy living and inanimate things at will.  The deeper
secrets of the mage will be discussed later in this treatise--such secrets are
not for the eyes of all men...

THE WAY OF THE AVATAR

Embodying the fortitude of a fighter, the quickness--and quick-wittedness--of
a bard and the mystic insights of a mage, you have spent long years mastering
the principles of virtue.  Many are the times you have savored the syllables
of the mantras and the spicey scent of incense during morning meditation.  But
you are equally stirred by the sounds and smells of combat, being as much at
hom eon the field of battle as in a solemn shrine.

A paragon of integrity, you have always south total understanding of the world
around you, often journeying to the libraries of the Lycaeum or conferring
with the scholars of Moonglow and Yew.  However, your love of scholarly
pursuits does not weaking your ties to the world outside the cloistered halls
of academe.  Your devotion to your companions and those in need is total, and
you are ever aware that the principles of virtue are designed to guide us in
our relationships with our fellow man.

Your path offers both great risk and grand reward, but you are concered with
neither.  Driven to follow this, the highest path, by forces unknown and
unknowable, you follow the Way of the Avatar to whatever end destiny has
decreed.

ADVENTURING AS A PARTY

Even the most valiant and powerful adventurer cannot stand alone against all
of the obstacles that will block his path.  Banding together with other
likehearted fellows will give you the strength of numbers, and, of equal
importance, a diversity of talents which can be drawn upon along your way.
The Avatar joined by the fighter, bard and mage makes for a most imposing and
formidable team.

Putting their trust in your wisdom and skills, party members usually move as a
group toward a common objective.  There may be times, however, when an
individual party member may set out on his own path whilst the remainder of
the party awaits his return--it is often prudent to send someone ahead to
scout a trail, for example, or to test the integrity of a decaying bridge
which hangs tenuously over a thundering river.  However, as the acknowledged
leader of the group, you may at any time summon back individuals who have set
out on their own, regrouping the party for further travel.

An adventuring party accumulates many things during its travells--things
purchased or found in the towns and countryside, and treasures collected from
the corpses of fallen foes.  Travelling is often made easier if provisions and
equipment are distributed evenly amongst the party members.  The well-
organized party works together, sharing with each other the things they carry,
aiding each other on their long journey.

GETTING AROUND IN BRITANNIA

The frequent traveller in Britannia learns to avail himself of the various
means of transport which can be obtained.  Acquiring a fine steed from the
village stables, you will soon learn that such a mount will not only improve
the quality of travel from town to town, but also give you a decided advantage
in combat against those who would impede your progress.  When a quest requires
crossing the high seas, sailing vessels of various types may be obtained from
the shipwrights that do business along the coastal ports of call.  It has even
been said that some adventuresome souls have learned a way to travel in a
craft that is lighter than the air itself, but these rumors, though
widespread, remain unconfirmed.

THE PARTY IN CONFLICT

Without fail, the travelling party will be set upon by people and creatures
whose sole purpose is to cause mayhem and sorrow.  Let the traveller beware.
When entering into mortal combat against one of the myriad creatures of the
land, learn to measure its strength and speed, nothing both its tactics and
endurance.

One creature may attempt to bludgeon you senseless, while others attack you
from afar with hurled weapons.  Many of the mythical beings you'll encounter
will use magic and illusions in their efforts to subdue you.  If you can
survive their attacks and deal punishing blows of your own in return, you will
share the victor's right to search their fallen corpses for whatever bounty
they carry.

It is useful to devise strategies that will increase the party's chances of
survival in combat.  Before combat begins, each party member can be assigned a
field position (frontal attack, flanking maneuvers or long range rear
position).  When the party comes under attack, the party members will move
automatically to their predetermined positions and fight according to the
strategy they've been assigned.

As effective as predetermined combat positions are, you may choose not to
assign each party member a particular strategy.  In this case, your allies
must act independently in combat.  Situations may even occur in which a member
of the party becomes a berserker.  When this happens, he will simply charge
and attack the most formidable opponent in sight.

A special note is in order for spellcasters.  While invoking magic spells will
give you a decided advantage in battle, not all creatures will be affected
by them in the same manner.  Therefore, you must learn to use your magical
talents judiciously, lest you waste valuable reagents and psychic energy.

THE PARTY AT REST

As a party becomes weary from the fatigue of a long journey and many battles,
it can set up camp in a safe place away from the hustle and bustle of town.
The burning campfire will take the chill out of the cool night air while the
party members eat some of the provisions they carry in their packs, perhaps
enjoying a round of storytelling or song.  With bellies full, the travellers
should take a few hours sleep to ready themselves for the challenges of a new
day.  Sleep provides an opportunity for much needed healing to the injured and
battle-weary adventurer.

It is wise to let one of the party members stand guard while the others sleep
so that he may awaken them if trouble approaches in the night.  Since the
grou's guard gets no sleep, he should be allowed to rest the following night
while another stands guard.

EXPERIENCE AND THE LEVELS OF ATTAINMENT

The much-travelled adventurer will face many opportunities to explore new
places, talk with people, solve puzzles and complete quest.  As you do these
things, experience will lead to increased physical strength, dexterity and
intelligence, giving you greater capacity to fulfill your destiny.

You can only gain a true appreciation of such increases by returning to one of
the Shrines of Virtue and engaging in reflection and meditation.  To meditate,
learn the mantra of the shrine of your choice.  Then talk to the shrine and
follow its instructions.



COSMOLOGY

There exists an extraordinary cosmic association between the gravity of the
moons and the delicate fabric of time and space.  As though pulling the
strings of some cosmic marionette, the moons cause radiant moongates to appear
on the land below.  Step through one of these shimmering corridors of light
and you will be transported to a new time or place.  Moongates generaly appear
at locations where fragments of extraterrestrial rocks called "moonstones"
have been buried.  There are at least two types of moongates--blue and red.

Blue moongates, generated by moonstones, generally focus on destinations in
but a single world--the world in which they appear.

Their power, awesome though it may seem, is limited, allowing the traveller to
teleport only from the location of one moonstone to that of another.  The
moonstone the user travels to is determined by the phase of the moon that
appears directly overhead in the sky.  Through experimentation and
observation, the moongate trveller can correlate the phases of the highest
moon with the destination the gate will select.

Red gates, generated by the powerful obsidian Orb of the Moons, can send the
traveller anywhere in Britannia.  In fact, the holder of this black stone can
teleport to worlds other than his own.  I, Lord British, have used the red
gates often, but there is, no doubt, much more to be learned about these
gates.

LAST WORDS

Consider carefully the thoughts I have set down in this treatise.  Refer back
to these words often, that you may better understand your experiences as you
journey throughout the land.

You are advised to keep a personal journal of your experiences.  Make notes of
conversations with the good citizens of Britannia.  Record information found
on signs or read in books or scrolls.  Keep track of the location of
provisions--items that seem unnecessary at one time may become useful at
another.  They may hold information vital to your quest.

Finally, I must share with you news but recenty received from the scholars of
the Lycaeum.  In compiling information about the daemonic Gargoyles invading
our land they have begun to detect a pattern.  It appears that our foes are
trying to capture the Shrines of Virtue found near the major towns.  The
moonstones are now in their possession, and, as each new shrine falls, a stone
is placed on the altar there.  To prevent anyone from removing the stones, the
gargoyles have erected impenetrable force fields around the altars.  Go to the
shrines at your earliest opportunity, free them and seek guidance at the
altars through prayer and meditation.

I urge you, my Avatar, to uncover the dark purposes of the gargoyles before
the last shrine falls.  I fear you may be Britannia's last hope.

THE IMPLEMENTS OF BATTLE

No brave adventurer, knight or common traveller should venture into the
hostile regions of Britannia without an appropriate selection of armour and
weponas.  Whenever possible, wear strong armour, a helm and shield, magical
rings, tunics or amulets, and, of course, carry an effective weapon.

BODY ARMOUR

Foolish is the adventurer who embarks on a quest without the best armour he
can afford.  Several different types of armour are available--everything from
inexpensive and relatively ineffective cloth to costly but highly protective
plate.  The armourers of Britannia will gladly allow you to examine their
wares.  Take advantage of this and acquire the armour best suited to your
abilities and fighting style.

Helms
An unprotected head is sure to be the target of any shrewd opponent's sword.
Helms are available in a variety of leather and metal forms, and one should be
worn at all times when combat seems likely.

Shields
Unless wielding a heavy, two-handed weapon, the warrior should carry a shield
with which to parry and block his opponent's attacks.  Shields are constructed
of wood or metal and vary greatly in shape and weight.

WEAPONS

The variety of types and uses of weapons exceeds full explanation in this
treatise.  Still, the proper choice of weapons is the single most important
decision a warrior makes before setting out to do battle.  In all cases, as
your finances and opportunities allow, choose weapons which deliver the most
powerful damage at the greatest range.

Daggers
Useful for stabbing and cutting in close-quarter fighting and for throwing in
long range combat, the dagger is a most convenient and lightweight weapon to
keep on hand.

Main gauche
Similar to a dagger, the main gauche also sports defensive hand protectors
that can be used to parry an opponent's attack.  Unlike a dagger, a main
gauche cannot be thrown.

Swords
The warrior's chief weapon, swords come in two varieties:  short swords, and
two-handed swords.  Despite their name, short swords are formidable weapons--a
good thing, for only the strongest adventurers can wield the hefty two-handed
swords.  Always examine a sword closely before buying it, paying particular
attention to its weight and the force with which it will deliver a blow.

Missile weapons
A complete battle strategy must include the use of weapons which can be shot,
thrown or hurled from a great distance toward advancing opponents.
Lightweight, hand-held items such as daggers, spears, axes or flasks of
flaming oil can be most effective in times of need.  Bows and crossbows are
capable of firing with tremendous force, but they require the use of both
hands and cannot be used effectively at point blank range.  Some clever
travellers have even been known to carry slings so they can drive off
aggressors with hurled stones.

Bludgeoning weapons
While the effectiveness of cutting and thrown weapons is determined by the
dexterity of the user, bludgeoning weapons, like clubs, depend upon the
strength of the wielder.  The mace is favored by many knights, whereas the
two-handed hammer has been used by the mightiest of warriors to deal a
crushing blow to the foe.

Polearms
A polearm is generally a stout wodden or metal staff topped by a metal cutting
or bludgeoning fixture.  The morning-star, a variation on this theme, consists
of a staff with a chain attached to one end, and attached to the chain, a
heavy, spiked bludgeon.  Morningstars, halbers and other polearms are prized
for the damage they are capable of doing and for their long reach.
Unfortunately, polearms are unwieldy weapons which are most effective in the
hands of a user possessed of great strength and dexterity.



A BESTIARY

Numerous and diverse are the beasts that inhabit the plains, forests,
waterways, and dungeons of Britannia.  Attempts to catalog them all have met
with only limited success--such an endeavor requires the researcher to put his
life in grave peril in order to make his observations.  Therefore, much of
what follows is information collected from first hand accounts of travellers
and adventurers who have managed to return with their tales.

Acid Slug:  Though seldom encountered except in the darkest corners of the
dampest caves, this featureless creature will secrete its corrosive juices on
anything you possess that is metal, thus dissolving it.  Painful but
superficial skin burns may result from contact with the acid while it eats
away at your armour.  Conventional weapons have little effect on the monster,
whereas a flame will send it fleeing.

Alligator:  Care must be taken whilst wading in the murky swamps which are the
home of this aggressive man-eater.  Possessiong great physical strength, this
fearsome lizard can inflict heavy damage with a single blow from its mighty
tail.

Ant, giant:  The shifting desert sands conceal these warrior insects all too
effectively.  Beware their powerful mandibles, capable of crushing a man in an
instant.

Bat, giant:  Equipped with keen hearing and night vision, these large, winged
rodents are swift and efficient in their nocturnal attacks.  Though difficult
to hit, their fur-covered bodies are extremely vunerable to damage.

Bird:  Generally posing no serious problem to the traveller, these swift,
delicate creatures can peck annoyingly about the head if they are disturbed or
threatened.

Cat:  Among the most common of domesticated beasts, the cat is often found
prowling about alleys and storefronts, looking for bits of food or hapless
mice.

Corpser:  Found only in deep, labyrinthine caverns, these hellish, tentacled
ghouls drag their screaming victims into subterranean dens.  What fearful end
awaits the poor captive none can say.  Only a burning flame has been known to
have any effect on these creatures of the dark.

Cow:  A fine source of meat and dairy products, the complacent cow is a common
sight on most farms.

Cyclops:  This hulking, one-eyed titan fears no one.  Possessed of remarkable
strength, it wields a mighty oaken club when it isn't hurling large boulders
as its foes.  The earth trembles as this giant lumbers about its domain, or so
say those who claim to have survived an encounter with a cyclops.

Daemon:  This most wicked and formidable of foes is not to be underestimated.
Overwhelming strength, skill and intelligence make daemons nearly unbeatable.
Possessing magical powers rivaling the most powerful of mages, the daemon can
summon hordes of his brothers to assist him in killing or possessing his
victims.  Being already undead, the daemon has little fear of death.  You are
forewarned!

Deer:  These graceful athletes of the forest can be spotted dashing through
the shadows on sunlit afternoons.  Deer are a good source of food, but be
aware that the antlers they sport can do significant damage.

Dog:  Though related to the vicious wolf, the common dog poses far less of a
threat than his wild counterpart.  As much at home in the field hunting
rabbits as at the dinner table of its master, the dog should be respected, but
not feared.

Dragon:  How many myths have been built around this winged, fire-breathing
holdover from Britannia's distant past?  Even the strongest warrior has been
known to wilt under the intense magical flames and noxious fumes that pour
from the enraged beast's nostrils.  Though mortal, dragons are extremely
difficult to kill.  It is, therefore, a wonder that some bold souls have
actually managed to steal eggs from a dragon's nest to satisfy the culinary
delights of wealty town dwellers!

Drake:  Smaller than their cousins, the dragons, but no less ferocious in
battle, drakes are usually found in the company of their more formidable
relatives.  In a battle against a dragon, one must be ever mindful of the
deadly drakes.

Gargoyles:  Frequently confused with daemons, the gargoyles are a little
understood race of beings.  Only fragments of information have made their way
back from expeditions to the underworld habitat of these creatures.  We do
know that there are two classes of gargoyles--a dominant, winged variety and
smaller, wingless drones.  The larger gargoyle is a daunting opponent,
possessing very high intelligence and impressive magical powers.  But, the
smaller drones are not to be ignored, for their attack is deadly, despite
their apparent lack of magical ability.  Scholars at the Lycaeum are
feverishly analyzing all incoming information regarding these perplexing
creatures.

Gazer:
How this monstrosity evolved is anybody's guess, for gazers are among the most
unusual creatures found in the realm.  They are usually spotted hovering above
the ground in dungeons, searching for creatures they can mesmerize with their
multiple eyes.  One experienced adventurer claims that gazers emit a strange
buzzing sound as they move about.  Remain alert when you suspect the presence
of a gazer, as it is constantly on the alert for prey.

Ghost:  Ghosts are generally found in cemeteries and other places of the dead,
though their movements are all but unlimited.  These ethereal spirits pass
easily through solid walls and other obstacles, making them difficult to chase
and difficult to elude.  Though they do not possess great strength, their
mobility and ability to use magic make them a force to be reckoned with.

Gremlin:  Unimpressive in battle, gremlins usually roam in packs and will
attempt to overcome you through sheer force of numbers.  Given the chance,
these persistent creatures will take whatever food you are carrying in your
pack, distributing it amongst themselves in a frenzy of feeding.

Headless:  The product of a wizard's failed experiments, these wretched
creatures somehow manage to sense the location of their quarry and strike with
unnatural accuracy.  Do not fall prey to pity, for a headless would as soon
strangle you with its bare hands as accept your mercy.

Horse:  Being both strong and swift, these companions of the trail are
invaluable when time is of the essence and one's strength is at an end.  The
traveller should obtain a steed early in his adventuring.  Occasionally, you
may spy a majestic wild stallin roaming the broad plains, but catching and
taming it is another thing.

Hydra:  The putrid quagmire of the swamp is the spawning ground of this
botanical nightmare.  Survivors of the Great Battle on the Bloody Plains tell
of driving the enemy into the adjacent swamplands where the carnivorous hydras
completed their mission of destruction.  While fearsome, hydras also bring
good luck, of a sort--when one finds a hydra, the valued nightshade mushroom
can usually be found close by.

Insects:  These pesky, flying nuisances can be quite bothersome if stirred up
by the careless explorer.  A single buzzing swamp fly can be annoying; a
biting swarm can leave the traveller depleted and exhausted.

Mimic:  Disguised as abandoned treasure chests, these masters of illusion wait
patiently for passing adventurers whose greed exceeds their wisdom.  if you
take a moment to observe questionable chests from a safe distance, the mimic
may reveal its true nature by spitting venom in your direction.

Mongbat:  Resembling a monkey as much as a bat, these winged anomalies are
swift and powerful in their attacks.  Though seldom encountered except in the
deepest dungeons, encountering one in the dim subterranean light can unnerve
even the stoutest among you.

Mouse:  This timid rodent seldom ventures from its lair except under cover of
night, and then only in search of crumbs of food.  Cheesemakers are especially
wary of the nocturnal activities of these otherwise benign creatures.

Rabbit:  Though quite shy and non-threatening, these long-eared creatures are
the bane of farmers, whose crops attract them in hordes.

Rat, giant:  These voracious, overgrown rodents have evolved over the
centuries in the dank, inhospitable sewers that honeycomb the levels below
some castles.  Having grown immune to most poisons, they are difficult to
exterminate.  Even a single bite from one of these giants can cause disease or
plague.

Reaper:  A remnant of an ancient enchanted forest swallowed up long ago in a
cataclysmic upheaval, the reaper at first appears as a solitary tree trunk
rooted in the dungeon rock.  Closer examination reveals a grim intelligence
which lashes out with long, gnarled branches and magical bolts of destruction.
But, the resourceful adventurer can turn the threat of the reaper into the
evening's campfire, ofttimes uncovering hidden treasure in the process.

Rotworms:  Born of the decaying detritus which carpets the swamplands, these
loathsome invertebrates are more nuisance than threat--a pass of your torch
across their path will usually keep them at bay.

Scorpion, giant:  Is there anyone who has not flinched at the sight of an
angered scorpion, its stinger poised to inject its victim with deadly venom?
You are advised to keep moving when confronted by one of these armoured
nightmares, lest you perish where you stand.

Sea Serpent:  Like its land-bound cousin, the dragon, a sea serpent will
attack the seagoing traveller with magical fireballs and violent physical
swipes of its long tail.  The wise sailor avoids this nasty beast.

Sheep:  Among the most docile of the beasts of the field, flocks of these
highly beneficial creatures serve the common good by providing wool to the
garment- and rug-makers and fine mutton to the pubs.

Silver Serpent:  Since the days of ancient Sosaria, the silver serpent has
been a part of our lives.  Its form has been found etched on tomb walls, and
ancient monuments have been found which were crafts in its image.  Yet, a
recent scouting brigade claims to have seen a dead silver serpent of
incredible size near a gargoyle encampment.  The scouts observed for a time
and, upon their return, reported that the gargoyles milked the slain creature
of its venom and even ingested the fluid thus derived before entering battle.
This ritual act seemed to give the gargoyles a short-term increase in
aggression and strength, though causing their death in the end.  Whether the
drinking of venom actually increased the gargoyles' strength is currently the
subject of some debate at the Lycaeum.

Skeleton:  The expressionless, hollowed eyes of the skeleton belie the malice
that animates this otherwise lifeless latticework of bone and sinew.  Conjured
up by the malcontented mages bent on mischief, these creatures--the restless
remains of fallen warriors--are both fearless and tireless in battle.

Slime:  This shimmering, amorphous mass seems more an oddity than a threat
when first encountered.  Constantly dividing and recombining, it seeks to
surroung the traveller who happens upon its swamp or dungeon lair.  Though
susceptible to damage from ordinary weapons, the experienced adventurer is
always ready to use fire against the ooze's subtle maneuvers.

Snake:  Emerging from their rocky lairs at the first morning light, these
reptiles spend their days basking in the sun, warming their cold-blooded
bodies so they can strike swiftly at their unsuspecting prey.  They can even
spit poisonous venom from several yards away with accuracy that is both
horrifying and deadly.

Spider, giant:  Though they spin their lethal webs deep inside dark lairs,
spiders of this gargantuan variety often venture forth in search of prey.
They are capable of inflicting painful bites or spitting their toxic sputum
from great distances.  But they are not invincible, and can be killed with a
few well-placed blows.

Squid, giant:  The dreaded scourge of all mariners, this horror of the high
seas is legendary for its ability to destroy a large sailing vessel with its
dextrous tentacles and crushing beak.  It being exceedingly strong and
durable, one should avoid confrontations with this nemesis of the deep.

Tangle Vine:  Though this plant resembles a common hedge of briars and
thistles, wary adventurers take care to avoid tangle vines.  The sharp thorns
that adorn this creeping foliage radiate from a well-protected central flower
pod.  As if the swiftly growing limbs weren't threat enough, the flower pod
gives off a sleep-inducing fragrance whenever it is threatened.

Troll:  The brutish troll takes perverted pleasure in hiding beneath bridges
so it can terrorize the unsuspecting traveller.  Fortunately, trolls are
relatively weak and they lack endurance, so they pose only a moderate threat
when encountered.

Wisp:  Often mistaken for harmless, forest firefly, the nocturnal wisp can
both mystify and antagonize the adventurer.  Though only causing minor harm in
any single attack, its uncanny ability to dance about the field of battle,
striking at will, can lead to serious cumulative injury.

Wolf:  Both revered and feared, this canine lord stalks the high plains and
forest alike on its quest for survival.  Never, ever, put this wary beast in a
threatening situation!  Its bite is far worse than its mournful howl.

THE SECRET KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGE

Powerful as the alien moongates are, they are by no means the only forms of
magic you will encounter in Britannia.  The mages of this land possess much
aracane knowledge and have many abilities beyond those of common fok.  Using
keen intuition, endless experimentation and the rigorous study of ancient
tomes, amges have learned to harness the creative and destructve forces of
Nature.

The mage's principle tool is his spellbook, a collection of incantations and
alchemical formulae which empower him in marvelous and often unexpected ways.
Learn now the inner secrets of spellcasting, information reserved for the
elite society of sorcerors.

THE ARCANE ART OF SPELLCASTING

Magical energy is structured as eight concentric spheres, each composed of
networks of light connected to he physical plane by unseen bonds.  The
spellcaster stands within the center sphere, extending his hands to the outer
shells of light where he manipulates the energies to suit his pleasure.  In
one hand, he holds his spellbook, open to the page containing the description
of his chosen incantation.  In his other hand, he cluthes a vial containing
herb and mineral reagents, the mixture serving as the catalyst for his spell.
Thus prepared, he utters the incantation, fusing matter and energy into a
display of power.  The spell has been cast, leaving the caster drained in
spirit, but fulfilled in accomplishment.

This simple explanation fails to exphasize botht he risks involved in
spellcasting and the skill necessary to harness the forces of magic
successfully.  Two cautionary notes are in order here:

First, even though a spell may appear to be cast successfully, there is some
chance that it will not accomplish its intended purpose, or that it will do so
in only a partial manner.  In some cases, a spell will fail to hit its target
due to forces and ethereal eddies unseen by the human eye.  Also, certain
creatures are immune to some spells, requiring the spellcaster to find other
means to defeat them.

Second, some spells affect only one person or creature while others affect all
peole or creatures in the vicinity.  Take care when casting a spell which acts
on an area rather than an individual target--if you or your friends are in the
affected area, you will be touched by the spell's power as surely as your
inteded victim!

THE ALCHEMY OF SPELLCASTING

The prepartion of a spell's reagents is performed at the moment of
spellcasting, thus allowing the chemical reactions to reach their peak even as
the appropriate mantra is uttered.  Some reagents are relatively common herbs
and minerals, available at any magic shop.  Others must be sought after
diligently, often requiring the mage to travel to distant and inhospitable
places in search of an obscure fungus or root.

These are the reagents necessary to the casting o magic:

Black Pearl
One oyster in ten thousand will yield a black pearl suitable for spellcasting
purposes.  It is usually crushed to a fine, iridescent powder before being
combined with other reagents.  The black pearl is used as a kinetic
propellent.

Blood Moss
"Moss," is may be called, but blood moss is, in reality, a fungus gathered in
the enchanted forest of Spiritwood.  There it is found growing under the
loose, dead bark of fallen trees.  Blood moss is used to enhance mobility and
movement.

Garlic
This common household spice is effective in warding off evil spirits and
negating black magic.  Preparations for use generally involve grinding the
washed cloves of garlic between two flatirons until they are reduced to a
pungent paste.

Ginseng
The wizened physicians of ancient Sosaria wrote often of the curative powers
of this bitter root.  Prepare a syrupy, pure extract by reboiling forty times
with clear mountain water, letting the mixture develop a strong, acrid odor.

Mandrake Root
The most sought after herb of the spellcaster, mandrake root grows along the
loamy banks of stagnant swamps.  Once found, mandrake must be dug up carefully
so as not to damage the tap root, for it is in the root that the greatest
concentration of active ingredients is found.  Carefully remove the tough,
outer skin, again giving special attention to the sensitive tap root.  Using a
fine-toothed silver fork, comb out the cottonlike fibers that make up the
root's heart.  The combed matting is boiled in pure water for no more than one
hour, after which is it dried thoroughly and stored in a tightly sealed jar.
When used in a spell, mandrake root increases the power of the desired
enchantment.

Nightshade
This hallucinogenic mushroom is often the critical ingredient in spells that
create illusions or poisonous effects.  Sprouting in swamps, and only in the
dark of night, this mushroom is easily distinguished from the others by the
way its stalk bruises when crushed.  Retain only the fungal cap and discard
the tough stalk.  The spores housed in the underside of the cap provide the
active ingredient and can be chopped into a fine mincemeat or boiled into a
bitter tea.

Spider's Silk
It takes many spider webs to make a full ounce of spider's silk, but the
binding power it adds to spells makes the effort well worthwhile.  Though the
web of any spider will do, one can reduce collecting time by scraping off the
fine silken hairs that cover the webs of giant spiders.  Rumors have been
heard of a cave where spider silk can be found in abundance.

Sulfurous Ash
This product of violent volcanic eruptions, sulfurous ash adds high levels of
energy to the spells which require it.  It is recommended that freshly
collected ash be sifted through a fine mesh sieve, ensuring consistency and
easy mixing.

LINGUA MAGICA:  THE SPELLCASTER'S WORDS OF POWER

The meanings of the syllables that form the incantations uttered by mages durin
spellcasting have been passed down from one Britannian generation to the next.
The mage's apprenticeship begins when he learns these potent syllables.  The
next task is to learn the proper way to speak the syllables.

It is important that the mage first prepare himself mentally by meditating on
the sound of his breathing, projecting his soul into a sublime state of
concentration.  To speak an incantation properly, the spellcaster draws a deep
breath, followed by a determined, forceful enunciation of each syllable.  The
entire breath should be fully expelled on the speaking of the final syllable.

The 26 syllables and their general meanings are as follows:

Syllable               Meaning      Syllable               Meaning
An ............. Negate/Dispel      Nox ................... Poison
Bet .................... Small      Ort .................... Magic
Corp ................... Death      Port ........... Move/Movement
Des ............... Lower/Down      Quas ................ Illusion
Ex ................... Freedom      Rel ................... Change
Flam ................... Flame      Sanct ..... Protect/Protection
Grav ............ Energy/Field      Tym ..................... Time
Hur ..................... Wind      Uus ................. Raise/Up
In ......... Make/Create/Cause      Vas .................... Great
Jux ......... Danger/Trap/Harm      Wis ........... Know/Knowledge
Kal ............ Summon/Invoke      Xen ................. Creature
Lor .................... Light      Ylem .................. Matter
Mani ............ Life/Healing      Zu ..................... Sleep

These syllables are combined to form the incantations used when casting
spells.  A list of spells can be found in the file ULT6SPLS.DOC.  This list,
while not necessarily complete, collects all of our current knowledge of the
ways of magic.

may have to say where you want to drop an item, for example).  To select a
location, click on it with the left mouse button.

If you don't want to use a mouse, move by pressing one of the arrow keys, or
one of the eight keys around the 5 on the numeric keypad.  These keys are also
used to select target locations--move the crosshairs on the screen to the
desired location and press <enter> to initiate the action.

You can pass your turn and do nothing by positioning the mouse pointer over
your character and clicking the left mouse button or by pressing the space
bar.

The Status Display In the upper right-hand corner of the screen is the
status display.  At the top of the display, the current position of
Britannia's sun and the positions and phases of the two moons in the sky are
shown.

Beneath this is a roster of all the members of your party, along with each
character's figure and current hit points.  A character whose hit points are
printed in red is hurt badly; one whose hit points are green is poisoned.

When a party has more than five characters, arrows appear at the top and
bottom of this part of the screen.  Click on these arrows to scroll up and
down through the list of party members.  The + and - keys can also be used.

If you click on a character's name, you will be shown their portrait and
statistics.  The higher a stat, the better.  Strength determines how much a
character can carry, and how effectively they can strike with bludgeoning
weapons.  Dexterity determines how quick they are (faster characters get to
move and/or attack more often), and how effective they are with non-
bludgeoning weapons as well as crossbows, bows, and other missile weapons.
Intelligence determines the character's bargaining ability and effectiveness
as a spellcaster.

The next two stats show pairs of numbers--the current number of points the
character has, and the maximum possible.  Magic points determine how many
spells can be cast.  For instance, a spell of the fourth circle uses four
magic points.  Health determines how much damage the character can take before
being killed.  Each hour, you recover a number of magic points equal to your
current level.  Health can only be regained by rest or healing.

The next statistic in the list is Level, which indicates how powerful a
character has become through experience gained in past adventures.  The last
stat, Experience, determines when a player is ready to progress to the next
level by meditating at a shrine.

To view a character's Inventory, click on one of the figures to the left of
the roster.

On the left side of the inventory display is a figure showing all equipment
that is readied for immediate use--either held in the character's hands, or
being worn.  If you are holding something that requires both hands, such as a
crossbow, you will not be allowed to put anything in the other hand.  Below
this figure is the current weight of all readied items, and the maximum weight
the character can have readied.

On the right side of the inventory display are all other items carried by the
character.  The total weight being carries is listed here, along with the
maximum weight the character can have in inventory.  To ready or unready an
item, just click on it with the left mouse button.  To look inside a container
in your inventory, such as a bag or a chest, just click on it.  Click on it
again to return to the main inventory display.

At the lower right, the character's current combat mode is displayed (see
"Begin/Break Off Combat," below).

At the lower left of the status display are five buttons.  From left to right,
their functions are:  show previous character, return to party display, switch
between portrait and inventory displays, show next character, and change
combat mode.  Again, without a mouse, press the following key with the
corresponding icon picture:

Key    Icon of
1      Man with arrow pointing left
2      Group of men
3      Head
4      Man with arrow pointing right
5      Two swords

To use the inventory display from the keyboard, press the <tab> key to move
the crosshairs to the status display.  You can then move to any item or button
with the arrow or numeric keypad keys, and press <enter> to select it.
Pressing the <tab> key again will return the crosshairs to the map.  The
function keys F1 through f8 will switch the display to show the different
members of your party.  (If you don't know the positon of a character in your
roster, the + and - keys allow you to show the next and previous characters.)
F10 will return to the main party display.  The asterisk (*) key will toggle
between a character's portrait and inventory displays.

The Message Scroll
At the lower right of the screen is the message scroll.  All text describing
things you see and hear, as well as the results of your actions, is displayed
here.  When a message is too long to fit on the scroll, a flashing, downward-
pointing arrow appears ont he bottom of the scroll.  Press the space bar or
click ont he message scroll to view the rest of the message.

The Command Icons
Underneath the map are ten command buttons.  The main commands in Ultima VI
can be selected either with the mouse or the keyboard.  To use a command from
the keyboard, simply press the first letter of its name. With the mouse, move
the pointer to the command button you want to use and click the lefft mouse
button.  Then select the object or person you want to use the command on.

For frequently used commands, such as Get, Look, Attack or Move, you can set
up a default commmand for use with the right mouse button.  Click the right
button on a command, and a blue line will appear under it.  From then on,
clicking the right button on any shape on the map or in your inventory display
will execute that command on that object.  You can change the default command
at any time.  For all functions other than executing the default command, the
left mouse button should be used.  The ten main commands are:

ATTACK (A) is used to fight monsters, animals, or people, or to attempt to
destory objects.  After choosing the Attack command, choose a target on the
map that is in range of the weapon you have readied.

CAST (C) allows you to cast magic spells.  You must have a spellbook readied,
and have enough magic points and reagents available to cast the desired spell.
When a character tries to Cast a spell, the spellbook will be shown in the
status display, listing the names of all the spells they have learned.  Each
name is followed by the number of times that spell can be cast with the
reagents in inventory.  To page through the spells, click on the blue arrow
buttons below the list or use the left and right arrow on the keyboard.

You cast a spell by clicking on its name, or by selecting it with the up and
down arrows and pressing <enter>. Typing the first letter of each syllable of
the spell also works.  For instance, to cast the Repel Undead Spell - AN XEN
CORP - you could type AXC and press <enter>. Some spells require you to
specify whom or what you are casting them on.  Simply select a target on the
map or in your inventory.

There is one special spell, the Help Spell, whih requires no reagents.  This
will return you instantly to Lord British's Castle.  It should only be used in
the most desperate of situations, however, as it will usually cost your party
many experience points.

TALK (T) lets you converse with the people you encounter in the game.  You can
also speak with some shrines and statues, and with the other members of your
party.  You must select the character on the map you wish to speak with.
Their portrait will appear in the status display while they are speaking.

You talk by typing single words on the keyboard and pressing <enter>. All
words may be abbreviated to the first four letters (e.g., "elephant" may be
abbreviated to "elep").

Most people will respond to the words "name," "job," and "bye." (The "bye"
command ends a conversation. You can accomplish the same thing by pressing
<enter> without typing anything.) Some people will also respond to the words
"join" and "leave," allowing you to add members to your party (up to a maximum
of eight) or remove them.

During the course of conversation, people give you an idea of what they're
interested in talking about.  If you have the help function on, as it is when
you start the game, the subjects they want to talk about will appear in a
different color on the screen; if help is off, you've have to figure out the
key words in their conversations.  However, be aware that some people will
respond to other subjects, if you ask them.

LOOK (L) allows you to identify anyone or anything in the location you select,
on the map or in your inventory.  This command can be used to read books,
signs and gravestones or to examine paintings. It will also give information
on the effectiveness of weapons and armor.  When you use the Look command on
an object you are adjacent to, you will search it.  This will reveal the
contents of chests, bags, crates, barrels, etc. It will also let you find
hidden items or secret doors.

GET (G) lets you pick up an object on the map. You must be standing next to
it. If it isn't too heavy, it will be put into your inventory.

DROP (D) can be used to lighten your load by getting rid of items you no
longer need.  First select the item in your inventory, then choose a spot on
the map to place it.

MOVE (M) is used to push an item or to move it between charaters in the party.

If you select an item on the map, you can sometimes push it to an adjacent
squrea to get it out of your way. If it's something alive, though, it may not
always let you! Moving an item into a square with a chest, barrel, or crate
will place the item inside it.

This command can also be used to move things in and out of containers or from
one character to another. To move an item to another character, click on them
on the map.  When you buy a new spell, you must move it into your spellbook
before you can cast it.

USE (U) operates any object that has some function. Among other things, it
will let you open and close doors and chests, enter or exit ships, climb
ladders, milk cows, mount horses, light or extinguish fires, look into
telescope or crystal balls, ring bells, eat or drink food and beverages, or
play musical instruments.  After using a musical instrument, you play it with
the numbers 0 through 9, and press <enter> when finished.

REST (R) lets your party set up a camp and recover health and magic points.
You will be asked how many hours you wish to rest, from 1 to 9, and who will
stand guard.  Select a character on the map display, or press <escape> to have
no guard. A chracter will not regain hit points if they are out of food, or if
they stand guard. If you are ambushed while resting, however, your party will
not be awakened unless you have someone on guard! You can only rest on land.
At sea, this command repairs your frigate. Multiple 'rests' may be required to
repair a ship completely.

BEGIN/BREAK OFF COMBAT (B) switches back and forth between party mode and
combat mode. In party mode, the members of your party automatically follow you
around.  In combat, each character will behave according to the combat mode
you have selected for them on their inventory dispaly. Characters in Front,
Rear, or Flank modes will position themselves in a formation centered around
you. Characters in Assault mode will attack the nearest enemy, while those in
Retreat mode will avoid combat.  Chracters in berserk mode will charge and
attack the strongest foe.  Lastly, if you select Command mode for a character,
you can control their actions each turn, just as you do for your own
character. You can change a character's combat mode at any time, even in the
middle of a battle.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS

Ctrl-S saves the game. You will be asked if you really want to save the game.
Type "Y" to save or "N" to cancel the command and keep playing.
Ctrl-R restores the game to the last saved position.  As in the case of the
Save command, you will be asked to replay "Y" or "N"
Ctrl-Q quits the game and exits to DOS. Make sure to save the game first if
you want to return to the same position later!
Ctrl-H toggles help mode on/off.
Ctrl-Z toggels sound and music on/off.
1 through 8 place a member of the party in solo mode.  In this mode, you can
move that character around and perform whatever actions you wish, while the
rest of the party remains motionless.  Note that you can't talk to people or
use ladders, dungeons entrances, or moongates in solo mode - you must be in
party mode.
0 (zero) exits solo mode and returns to party mode.
Esc aborts most functions.

Mages with little training and experience are limited in the spells they can
cast.  As a spellcaster grows in stature, penetrating the mysteries of the
higher circles of magic, he gains the ability to cast more powerful spells.
Great power is not without cost, however.  When he casts a spell, the mage
experiences a drain in magical power equal to the level of the circle of that
spell.  Thus, a simple first level spell drains one point while a fifth level
spell, more difficult to cast, drains five.  The caster's magical power
returns within a few hours.

 ULTIMA VI
  Part 1

 INTRODUCTION

 Avatar, you're being called on once again to save Britannia! A mysterious
Moongate has appeared and you have stepped into the world of Britannia. It
appears that the Shrines are being overrun by Gargoyles, and the entire land is
under attack. Lord British wants you to put a stop to this immediately. So,
you're off to prove your worth as the Avatar one more time.

 ULTIMA VI has had a major face lift. Compared with all the other ULTIMAs, it is
graphically the best. It also sounds the best. ULTIMA VI takes advantage of 256
color VGA graphics, which almost makes the game come alive. This walkthru will
attempt to help you in difficult places. I try not to go into too much detail,
because I think you need to discover things by yourself. Remember, if you have
problems not covered in this walkthru, you can stop by The Gamers' Forum. The
Press <CR> for more !c
I don't recognize that command. Key H for Help !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-5057

every step of the way through ULTIMA VI; without his guidance and help, I would
have been playing for another year!

 THE SHRINES

 Being a non-linear CRPG, ULTIMA VI doesn't really require you to do things one
way to progress through it. A good way to start developing your characters is by
saving the various Shrines. This part of the walkthru will lead you to all the
Shrines on the surface of Britannia.

 (NOTE: With some experimentation, you can use the Orb of the Moons that you
received at the beginning of the game to get to all the Shrines.)

 The first Shrine to free is the Shrine of Compassion. In order to liberate the
Shrine from the hold of the gargoyles, you need the rune and the mantra. To get
the rune, go to where the three musicians are playing (they're located in the
museum building). Speak with the child named Ariana and ask her about the rune.
She will tell you she has it but that you must go ask her mother for permission
to use it. Go speak with her mother. Her mother is the barmaid in the Blue Boar.
Say RUNE to her and she will say it is okay for you to have it. Go back, talk
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-5059

with Ariana, and tell her you have her mother's permission. She will now give
you the rune. The mantra for the Shrine of compassion is MU. Now, you're ready
to liberate the Shrine.

 To get to the Shrine of Compassion you must follow the eastern road out of
town. Follow the road until you get past the second stream. Head straight east
and you should see the Shrine Pillars. Located in the center of this circle of
pillars is the Shrine. After you dispatch the gargoyles, walk up to the Shrine,
and use the rune. When you are asked for the mantra, enter MU, and the Shrine
will be free. Take the Moonstone from the altar.

 The next Shrine to free should be the Shrine of Honor. The rune can be found in
Trinsic. It's on an altar in the middle of town. Just take it (you're the
Avatar, after all). You can get to the Shrine by following the road leading
south out of town. Just keep following the road and you should make it to the
Shrine. Go to the altar, use the Rune of Honor and the mantra SUMM, then take
the Moonstone.

 Now, you can free the Shrine of Justice. To get the rune you need to go to Yew.
Enter the tavern and move the plant by the south door. Under it you will find
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-5061

the rune of Justice. Head east out of town. The road should finally turn north.
Keep following the road north; don't take the road that branches off to the
east. The north road will finally bring you to the Shrine of Justice. Go up to
the altar and use the Rune of Justice and the mantra BEH, then take the
Moonstone.

 While close to Yew, you should visit the woodcutter. He is located in the
forest to the west of Yew. He shouldn't be hard to find. Go up and ask him for a
piece of wood. Buy the wood and prepare to save the Shrine of Sacrifice. Go to
the sawmill in Minoc (east of the city). Follow the road leading out of Minoc
and head east to get there. Have the miller turn your log into a board.

 Now, you must find Julia (she has a shop in the northern part of Minoc). Ask
her about Panpipes. Have her make some Panpipes out of your board. Take the
board to Selganor. Ask him about the rune and tell him you have panpipes. He
will take a look at the pipes and ask you to recite stones for him. Enter
6789878767653 and he will give you the rune.

 The Shrine of Sacrifice is located to the east of Minoc in the desert. It is
the circle in the center of the desert that is located on your map. Go up to the
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-13616

altar and use the rune and the mantra CAH.

 To save the Shrine of Spirituality, go to Skara Brae. Find Marney (her house is
located next to the boat dock north of town). Look in the chest in her house.
You should find the rune there. There are two ways I know of to reach the Shrine
of Spirituality. First, you can wait for two full-moons to appear, and take a
moongate; or you can use the Orb of the Moons that you received at the start of
the game. The orb is much easier to use; here's what to do. First, USE the orb.
You should see a set of cross hairs targeted on your character. Move the cross
hairs down one (to the bottom of screen), and two spaces to the left. Press
"ENTER," and a red gate should appear. With luck, this will get you to the
Shrine. At the Shrine, use the rune, the mantra OM, and take the Moonstone.

 Head to New Magincia to get the Rune of Humility. Find Antonio (located in the
building with blue government flags in front). Ask him about the rune and tell
him Conor is the most humble man in New Magincia. The Shrine of Humility is
located on the Isle of the Avatar. You should be able to identify it on your
map. A quick way to get there is to use the orb. Move the cross hair up one,
then two spaces to the left. Use the rune and the mantra LUM, and take the
Moonstone.

CompuServe CIS:TEG-13618


 To save the Shrine of Valor you must go to Lord British's castle. Go into the
kitchen and get some cheese. There will be a mouse running around the castle. At
night the mouse will be with Lord British in his room. Talk with the mouse and
ask it to join. Give it some cheese and let it join. Now, go to Jhelom and enter
the tavern (located in the northern part of town). At the back of the tavern is
a small mouse hole. Put Sherry (the mouse) in solo mode, and take her through
the hole. Get the rune and give it to the Avatar (do what you want with Sherry).
The Shrine of Valor is located to the south of Jhelom. To reach it, you can use
the raft by the southern dock in Jhelom. Use the rune and the mantra RA, then
take the Moonstone.

 The last shrine to free is that of Honesty. Go to Moonglow and find Beyvin's
cousin. He is usually located at the southern end of the island in the tavern.
Ask him about Beyvin, tell him you have visited the tomb, and you want the key.
He should give you a key and some flowers. Now, go to the sawmill located on the
northern end of the island. Xiao lives there. In the back of the sawmill you
will find a magically locked room. Unlock the door and take the stairs down.

 Wander around a bit to find more stairs leading down to the tombs. Search
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-13620

around the tombs until you find the one with flowers in front of it. Place the
flowers you're carrying next to the door and unlock it with the key. Search the
bones to find the Rune of Honesty. The Shrine of Honesty is located on an island
just to the north of your present location. Look on the map to the north of
Moonglow; you should see the circle that depicts the Shrine. Go to the Shrine,
use the rune and the mantra AHM.

 That's it for the Shrines. If you have trouble finding one, just look at the
map. The Shrines are the circles of stones scattered about the land.

 ULTIMA VI
  Part 2

 MAP, TABLET, GARGOYLES

 NOTE: This part of the walkthru is not necessary for finishing the game. If you
complete it, though, it will enhance your understanding of the game.

 After the Shrines are free and all of Britannia is throwing parties for you,
it's time to tackle a new puzzle. You should have shown the book that Iolo has
to Nystul, Lord British's mage. He will tell you to take it to Mariah at the
Lycaeum. She will tell you that she is missing part of a tablet that will help
to decipher the book; you need to find the other part of the tablet. From the
hint Mariah gives you, you should locate Zoltan. He usually hangs out around the
Blue Boar in Britain.

 Zoltan will tell you the missing part of the tablet was stolen by pirates. He
Press <CR> for more !




CompuServe CIS:TEG-13624

will tell you to go to Buccaneer's Den. Before you do, there is something that
you must do in the sewers of Britain.

 You won't find out much in Buccaneer's Den unless you join the Thieves Guild.
To do this you need a guild belt. Use the ladder in Nystal's work room (located
in Lord British's castle). You can recognize the room by all the potions that
line the table. There will be a ladder in the middle of the room. Go down into
the sewers. There are other ladders leading down, but take the one located
8S-11E. Use the Locate spell to find your way.

 After you go down another level, you can find the next ladder at 0N-7E. The
person you're looking for is north. So, proceed north to 12N-19E. The woman here
is a member of the Thieves Guild. You need to get her belt. You can either kill
her or use the Pickpocket spell to get the belt. Now, go to Buccaneer's Den.

 Buccaneer's Den is almost in the center of your map. If you translate the
runes, you will be able to pinpoint the exact location. It's to the east of the
Village of Paws. Once you are there, go to the tavern. There are two or three
people who will join with you here, but remember: You're looking for a map. The
first thing you should do is join the Thieves Guild. Behind the tavern there's a
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13627

room. To enter it, move the cauldron in the kitchen, then use (or look at) the
wall that the cauldron used to conceal to find a secret door.

 Go through the door. You will find another door a few steps away. Pick the lock
or blast it open. Talk to the man inside, and ask him about the Guild. If you
are wearing the belt, he will let you join. Now, go back into the tavern.
Sitting in the northeast corner at a small table will be a man named Homer. Ask
him about the map. He will give you some information about where to find the
different sections of the map. Keep in mind that talking to some of these people
may not be necessary; I just don't know which ones you can bypass.

 Once you have an idea where to look, it's off to the Dungeon Destard. Before
you talk to the cook in Trinsic, you need a Dragon's Egg. Destard is located
northwest of Trinsic at 37N-3W. Enter the Dungeon and head north. Be careful:
There are dragons everywhere. The way leading to the next level is at 37N-20E.
(There may be other ways down.)

 Once you are on the next level, go to 44S-9W. That will take you to the next
level. Now, go to 52S-17W. You should find the last way down. On this level you
will find Dragon's Eggs. Keep going north. You will run into a whole bunch of
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13629

dragons and you will find their eggs.

 Take a Dragon's Egg to Sandy, the cook in Trinsic. Ask him about pirates. He'll
tell you a number of places to go, and that the Mayor is a pirate. Go find the
Mayor of Trinsic (at the dock on the east side of town). Ask him about Alastor
Gordon, which is supposed to be his real name. Ask him about pirates. Ask him
about the map. He will break down sooner or later. Promise him you won't tell
anyone about the map, and he'll hand the map over to you.

 North of Trinsic, along the King's Way, there is usually a band of three
gypsies. The one named Arturos has a piece of the map. Ask him about the map,
and he will offer to sell it to you for 100 gold. After you're done here, you
need to get a ship, and head for Serpent's Hold. Also, make sure you have a gold
nugget, a magic gem, and a curved heater (the shields with the snake-like
emblem).

 On the way to Serpent's Hold, stop by the shipwreck located on the little
islands between Britannia and Serpent's Hold, at 71S-15E. Search this ship to
find another part of the map. Continue to Serpent's Hold (use the map). When you
get to Serpent's Hold, go into the Government Building. Korunada will be in the
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13631

main hall around noon. Talk to him, and ask him about the Guild and Shield.

 Go directly south from the Government Building, enter the Smithy's Shop, and
talk to Gherick. Ask him about the Shield, and give him the items necessary to
make it. Now, go north to the road, and travel east. When you get to the fork in
the road, take the northern path. From here, continue east until you reach
Morchella's house. Ask her about the map, and pursue your line of questioning
until she offers to trade you the map for the Shield. Give her the Magic Shield
(you can make another one if you need it).

 Okay, for a bit more sea travel, head to Dagger Isle. It's north of the island
on which Moonglow is located. Notice on your map the ring of mountains at the
north end of Dagger Isle? In this ring there lives a hermit with another part of
the map. Find his house using gems. Once you get inside the house, move his
piano and go down the ladder. Search through everything and you will find the
yet another part of the map. It will be in the southeast corner in a bag which
is stuck in a chest.

 From Dagger Isle, you can make an easy jaunt over to the big desert where the
Shrine of Sacrifice is located. The Shrine is the circle of stones in the center
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13633

of the desert. Go south from the Shrine to an anthill at 20N-67E and enter it.
Once you enter, go north, and look through the big clearing. At 32N-55E is
another hole leading down. (Remember: There is usually more than one way to go
between levels in the Dungeons.)

 Up around the north, you will find another way down at 40N-64E. After you go
down another level, go southwest to another downward passage at 23N-44E. Go
north, and when you get to it, take the east path. Follow this path until you
get to the open area. Keep going east across this area to an opening into
another large area. Find the queen ant (she will be the one with all the ants
around her). Go south and you will find a body around 25N-85E. Search the body
to find another part of the map.

 After you have finished with the anthill, return to Minoc. West across the bay
you will find the Dungeon Wrong. It is hidden in the mountains at 37N-24E. Enter
the Dungeon. The ladder leading down to the next level is in the room directly
to the east at 36N-31E. Go down, exit the room, and go east until you reach the
end of the hallway. In this room you will see a lever. Cast Telekinesis on it,
go back west until you get to the ladder at 40N-19E, and climb down.

Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-13635

 Go south and enter the first room to the east. There will be a hydra in the
room. There is also a secret door on the north wall at 37N-27E. Use the door and
follow the corridor until you reach the room at the end. Enter it and get the
map at 43N-36E.

 Travel to the Dungeon Shame. Shame is located at the end of Serpent's Spine
which surrounds Britain. Shame is in the area of water surrounded by mountains
to the west of Britain. You must take a skiff down the river to reach it. The
exact coordinates are 23S-20W. After you enter Shame, follow the corridor until
you reach the room filled with skeletons.

 From here, go south. Take the ladder at 36S-37W, go east, and keep following
this corridor. At the first fork, turn south. At the next fork, turn north. Take
the ladder down at 28S-3E, go south, and take the eastern passage (it's the only
way you can go eventually). Turn north at the fork and keep following this path;
you will find Ybarra at its end. Ask him about the map and give him some food to
get it.

 Now, you have all the pieces of the map except one. Go back to Homer and tell
him you have all the pieces. Make a deal with him and he will give you the last
Press <CR> for more !
CompuServe CIS:TEG-13638

piece of the map. The treasure is buried on an island southeast of Buccaneer's
Den (it looks like it's in the center of Buccaneer's Den, New Magincia,
Blackthorn's Castle, and Serpent's Hold). Once you reach the island, locate the
three stones to the north. Stand in the center of the stones. Walk south three
paces, west nine paces, and south twelve paces. You should be at 59S-50E. Equip
a shovel and dig to the south of where you're standing (you did bring a shovel,
didn't you?).

 Now, enter the Pirates' Cave. You will find a sign which reads: "This Way." Go
the opposite way. When you get to the next sign that says "This Way," follow it.
Keep going until you reach the junction, then head north. When you reach the
next junction, go east. Keep following the eastern route which will turn to the
north, back west, then south.

 Take the ladder at 69S-19E down. Go southwest and enter the Maze of Death. Make
your way to the center of the maze. You will find a ladder at 73S-4W. Take the
ladder down and head west. Pass up all the holes leading down until you find the
one at 68S-25W (it's in a larger area than most of the other holes). Go down and
follow the corridor until you reach the second set of poison fields. Dispel them
and head north. Pick the lock on the door or blow it open.

 Enter the building and take everything you want, but make sure you get the
Tablet and the Storm Cloak. After you are done here, go back to Buccaneer's Den,
and find Homer. Give the cloak to him (don't keep it...you're the Avatar!). Go
back to Moonglow and find Mariah (she will be in the Lycaeum). Ask her about the
tablet and she will tell you to get the other half from her study. Her study is
close by, and the other half of the tablet is on a table in plain sight. Get the
tablet, take it back to her, and let her decipher the book. You will learn who
the false prophet is, and you will get your next lead.

 BALLOON, BEH LEM, SINGULARITY

 Before journeying into the underground gargoyle world, you must build a hot-air
balloon. But first you will have to find the plans before you can begin to build
it.

 The plans are located below Sutek's Castle. Sutek has taken up residence in
Blackthorn's old castle. It's located on the island between the isle that the
Codex is on and Serpent's Hold. Go up to the front door and blow it away: You
don't need a key. After entering the castle, you will notice a drawbridge. To
lower the drawbridge, cast Telekinesis on the crank. Now, move the sword and the
wall mount. Look behind them and you will find a secret door. Enter it and take
the eastern path.

CompuServe CIS:TEG-13643

 Once you get out of the small hallway, look around on the western walls for a
secret door. Go inside and move the three levers so that the left and middle
ones point right, and the right one points left. Go back out and take the door
on the right. Enter this room and search the north wall for a secret door. Head
west until you reach the Hydra.

 In the room with the Hydra, you will find a secret door on the south wall.
Enter the room and go down the ladder. There aren't many places to go here, so
find the switches in the room to the northwest. The levers on the ground will
release the Silver Serpents! The switches on the wall open the doors that block
the exits; flip the ones on the wall. Now, go south and go down the ladder at
80S-59E. There is a secret door in this room at 79S-59E. After you go through
this door, take the eastern path. When you've descended to the next level,
follow the corridor until it branches eastward, and follow that corridor. Go
down the ladder at 65S-63E. There is a body located on this level at 65S-51E.
Search it to get the balloon plans.

 Now, you're ready to build the balloon. Go to Michelle in Minoc. Ask her about
plans, and she will offer to build a basket for you. Accept her offer, go to
Arbeth in Paws, and ask for silk. While you're in Paws, visit Mortude, and get
Press <CR> for more !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13646

some rope. Now, go to Charlotte in New Magincia and have her turn the silk
thread into cloth. Go back to Paws and have Marrissa sew the cloth into a bag.
Go back to Lord British's Castle and enter the sewers. You're looking for a
cauldron. Once you have done all this, use the balloon plans, and you will have
a balloon!

 It's time to journey into the land of the Gargoyles. Use the Moonstone. Move
the cross hair one space down and one left, and enter the gate. Once you arrive,
the first thing to do is let Beh Lem join your party. You will find him outside
the entrance to Hythloth in the underworld at 65S-71E. Let him join your group,
then go speak with his father. (He will give you directions to his father.)
After you speak with Beh Lem's father, go talk with Lord Draxinusom. Tell him
you surrender. Then, when he says he doesn't believe you, say the word
"Sacrifice." He will ask if you will wear an amulet. Answer "Yes." Now, you can
talk with the Gargoyles without them being afraid of you.

 Go to the Shrine of Singularity. Find the altar where you entered the land.
There will be a path leading northeast which ends at some mountains. Change the
wind so that it's coming from the south. Use your balloon and fly over the
mountains; the Shrine of Singularity is located on the other side.
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13648


 When the Shrine asks you who you want to help, say "Everyone." Now, you must go
to the Catacombs where Control, Passion, and Diligence are located. The Shrine
of Singularity will tell you the locations of each. (They're really easy to find
if you stay close to the shore.)

 DILIGENCE

 After entering Diligence, go south through two doors. Open the door leading
west and enter that room. There is a secret door at 73S-13E. Enter it, go down,
and talk to the altar.

 CONTROL

 This one will be harder to get through. Upon entering it, you will see switches
and levers. The following diagram shows how they will have to face in order for
you to get through:

   D        U
 -> ->    <- ->
 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13650

 ->          <-
 ->          <-
 ->          <-
 <- <- -> <- <-

 Put the levers and the switches up and down like I have shown, and you should
be able to make it through. Talk to the altar.

 PASSION

 In this dungeon, just go talk to the altar.

 After you have talked to each altar, go talk to the Shrine of Singularity
again. The mantra is "UnOrUs." Now you have a Sacred Quest. Go to the Codex of
Ultimate Wisdom. You can get there by using your moonstone and moving the cross
hair one space down and one right. Talk to the Codex to learn how to save the
land.

 ENDGAME

 Before you'll be ready to tackle the endgame, there are a few things you'll
need to gather. After you have everything, you can go back to the Codex.

 First, get the Vortex Lens from the Hall of Knowledge in Gargoyle land. Make
sure you read all the books, then go see the Gargoyle Seer. He will tell you
that you need to repair the Lens and have another one made. The Gargoyle Lens
Maker is northeast of the Seer's house. Go to him and he will repair your Lens.
Now, return to the Seer, and he will give you further instructions.

 After you are done in Gargoyle land, go to Minoc. There, you will find a Glass
Maker. Have him make you a glass sword. Now, you must go to StoneGate (
south of
Minoc in the mountains). To reach StoneGate, you can take a skiff from Minoc and
Press <CR> for more !


CompuServe CIS:TEG-13654

head south. Use gems to find your way. There is usually a child waiting on the
shore. You can also locate StoneGate on your map: It's very close to Cove, and
just a bit to the north.

 Once you get to StoneGate, go inside the castle, and find a fishing pole. Take
the pole to the shore and use it until you catch a fish. Take the fish to the
papa Cyclops and he will give you a key in exchange. Go back into the castle and
look for a secret door at 10N-37E. (This coordinate is also the castle's, so you
can use it if you are having trouble getting to StoneGate).

 Enter the secret door and go down. There will be levers all around you. Move
them all. Go back up and take one of the four visible ladders leading down. Once
you are downstairs, go to the room in the southeast corner, and go down the
ladder at 4N-43E. Find the ladder at 8N-39E and go down. Now, search for
10N-39E. Here, you will find a secret door. Go in the room the secret door leads
into and flip the switch. Go to the room that was closed off before you flipped
that switch. There, you will find another secret door at 13N-35E. Go in the
little room and unlock the door with the key the Cyclops gave you. The Vortex
Cube is at 16N-35E; take it.

 !CompuServe CIS:TEG-13656

 Go to Moonglow, find the Lens Maker (east of the Lycaeum), and ask him about
Lens. He will look your Vortex Lens over, and offer to make you a concave Lens
for a glass sword. Give him the sword and get the Lens. You're almost ready!

 Use your Moonstone to get to the Codex. (Move the cross hair down one, and
right one.) Go up to the Codex, drop the Britannia Lens halfway between the left
flame and the Codex, and you will see rays of light if you have the Lens placed
correctly. Then, place the Vortex (Gargoyle) Lens to the right of the Codex.
Again, you will see rays of light coming out of this Lens if you have it in the
correct place. Make sure the Lens is halfway between the flame and the Codex.
Now, drop the Vortex Cube in front of the Codex, drop all eight Moonstones into
the Cube, and use the Cube! Congratulations! You've saved the land!

 from: the Asimov collection



SOLVE FOR: ULTIMA III-THE EXODUS


ABILITY POINTS: (STRENGTH,DEXTERITY,INTELLIGENCE,WISDOM)
A HIGH STRENGTH IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR CLASS IS.
A HIGH DEXTERITY IS NEEDED FOR THIEVES.
A HIGH WISDOM IS NEEDED FOR CHARACTERS THAT USE CLERICAL SPELLS.
A HIGH INTELLIGENCE IS NEEDED FOR CHARACTERS THAT USE WIZARD SPELLS.

GOLD:
 GOLD IS FOUND IN CHESTS. GOLD CAN BUY WEAPONS,ARMOR,FOOD,HEALING,
  AND ABILITY POINTS (SEE TEMPLES).
 TO GET A LOT OF GOLD,YOU CAN DO IT SEVERAL WAYS:
   1.  CREAT A LOT OF DUMMY CHARACTERS. FORM THE PARTY. JOURNEY
        ONWARDS. JOIN GOLD TO ONE CHARACTER. HAND ALL THE FOOD TO THAT
        ONE CHARACTER. QUIT OR SAVE GAME. DELETE THE "DUMMY"
        CHARACTERS,EXECPT FOR THE ONE WITH ALL THE FOOD AND GOLD.
        USE THAT CHARACTER AS A PERMANENT ONE.
   2.  GO OUT AND KILL MONSTERS (THIS METHOD ALSO INCREASES YOUR
        EXPERIENCE AND YOUR CHANCES OF KICKING THE BUCKET).
   3.  LOCATE YOUR CASTLE (YOU START NEAR IT). GO TO THE DUNGEON
        EAST OF IT. MAT THE 2ND,3RD,AND 4TH LEVELS USING A GEM.
        USE A WIZARD SPELL "D" OR A CLERIC SPELL "D" TO GET DOWN TO
        THE 3RD LEVEL. GET ALL THE GOLD THERE. DESCEND DOWN TO THE
        4TH LEVEL GET ALL THE GOLD THERE. KLIMB BACK UP TO THE 3RD
        LEVEL. CAST WIZARD OR CLERIC SPELL "E" TO GET TO THE 2ND LEVEL.
        GO TO THE FOUNTAIN OF HEALING AND HEAL ALL THE
        DAMAGE DONE. CAST SPELL "E" AGAIN. CAST IT AGAIN TO GET
        OUT OF THE DUNGEON. THIS WAY PROVIDES ABOUT 3000 GOLD
        AND SOME EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME.
ESTALISHING A HOME BASE:
 LOCATE YOUR CASTLE. WAIT ON TOP OF IT UNTILL A MONSTER ATTACKS YOU.
 KILL THE MONSTERS. **DON'T TAKE THE CHEST OF GOLD**. KEEP MOVING
 AROUND YOUR CASTLE AND KILLING MONSTERS UNTIL YOU HAVE CREATED A
 SOLID MASS OF CHESTS AROUND YOUR CASTLE. MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH SO
 THAT FIRE FROM BOATS AND DRAGON-LIKE MONSTERS CAN'T HIT YOU.
 THIS CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE IN SOSARIA. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A
 SAFE SPOT WHERE YOU CAN REST AND KILL MONSTERS ONE AT A TIME AT
 YOUR LEISURE.

GO TO THE KING IN YOUR CASTLE WHEN YOU HAVE ACQUIRED 100 EXPERIENCE
 POINTS. TRANSACT WITH HIM. YOUR # OF HIT POINS IS INCREASED.
 DO THIS EVERY 100 EXPERIENCE POINTS.

TRY TO GET KEYS,POWDERS,GEMS,AND TORCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 KEYS UNLOCK DOORS.
 POWDERS NEGATE TIME.
 GEMS ALLOW YOU TO VIEW THE ENTIRE WORLD,TOWN,DUNGEON YOU ARE IN.
 TORCHES LIGHT UP DUNGEONS.

>>> BOATS:
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF BOATS. THE BOATS YOU OWN, AND THE BOATS OF
  PIRATES.
TO GET A BOAT, YOU MUST ENTER THE COMBAT STAGE WITH THE BOAT.
 TO GET THE BOAT WITH MINIMUM DAMAGE, MOVE AROUND UNTIL THE PIRATE
 FROM ONE SIDE. WAIT OUT OF REACH OF ITS GUNS AND OBSERVE HOW BAR
 AND WHERE ITS CANON FIRE GOES. PLOT A ROUTE THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO
 THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. THE BOAT WILL NOT FIRE UPON YOU ON THIS
 LAST MOVE. AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD ENTER THE COMBAT MODE. IF
 YOU DON'T ATTACH THE BOAT. KILL THE PIRATES. YOU NOW HAVE A
 BOAT. BOARD IT. TO USE THE CANON, FIRE. KILLING MONSTERS WITH
 CANON FIR DOESN'T GIVE YOU EXPERIENCE OR GOLD.

>>> CHESTS:
 CHESTS CONTAIN GOLD AND MAYBE ARMOR OR WEAPONS.
 TO OPEN A CHEST, STAND ON TOP OF IT AND GET CHEST. THIS METHOD CAN
 BE DANGEROUS BECAUSE MANY CHESTS ARE TRAPPED WITH ACID,POISON,GAS,
 OR BOMBS.
 ANOTHER WAY TO OPEN A CHEST, THAT IS LESS DANGEROUS, IS TO CAST
 CLERIC SPELL "B". SOMETIMES THSI SPELL FAILS. IT ALLOWS YOU TO
 OPEN A CHEST WITHOUT TRIGGERING THE TRAP. MONSTERS CANNOT MOVE OVER CHESTS.

>>> TEMPLES:
TEMPLES RAISE ABILITIES.
TO GET TO A TEMPLE: BOARD A SHIP. SEARCH FOR THE WHIRLPOOL (IT
 IS THE WEIRD-LOOKING SWIRLING THING IN THE WATER AND IT IS CONSTANTLY
 MOVING). MOVE YOUR SHIP ON TOP OF IT. IT SHOULD LEAVE
 YOU ON THE SHORES ON A STRANGE LAND. PEER AT A GEM TO GET AN
 IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF PLACE YOU'RE IN. LOOK AT THE MAP AND SEARCH
 FOR 4 BUILDINGS (THEY SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE OPEN
 SPACE). PLAN A ROUTE TO ONE OF THE BUILDINGS. GO THE THE BUILDING.
 IT IS THE TEMPLE/SHRINE. LOOK AT THE BUILDING. IT SHOULD BE A
 SHRINE. ENTER IT. OFFER ONLY ONE HOULDRED GOLD PIECES AT A TIME.
 FOR EVERY 100,ONE OF YOUR ABILITIES SHOULD GO UP ONE POINT,
 ACCORDING TO WHICH ONE OF THE SHRINES YOU ARE IN. SEACH THE SHRINE
 (USING THE OTHER COMMAND) TO GET CARDS. LET ALL OFYOUR CHARACTERS
 SEARCH IT. THE AREA IS THE SAME EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO WHIRLPOOL.
 TO GET OUT OF THAT WORLD AND BACK TO SOSARIA, YOU MUST SEARCH FOR A BOAT
 IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE WORLD. THEN ONCE YOU GET
>>> DUNGEONS:
DUNGEONS ARE VERY DANGEROUS. THEY HOLD TRAPS. WINDS MAY PUT OUT
 YOUR SOURCE OF LIGHT,FOUNTAINS MAY POISON YOU OR JUST CAUSE DAMAGE
 TO YOU,AND MONSTERS ABOUND. FOOD MUST BE CONSIDERED ALSO. HOWEVER,
 GOING INTO DUNGEONS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET ARKS.
 EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A NEW LEVEL,PEER AT A GEM. MAP THE LEVEL,
 INCLUDING THE QUESTION MARKS. NOW YOU HAVE THE QUESTION MARKS TO
 YOU THAT SOMETHING IS THERE. GO TO WHERE THE QUESTION MARDS ARE.
 FIND OUT WHAT THEY REPRESEND AND MARK IT ON YOUR MAP.
 FOUNTAINS:
  FOUNTAINS HEAL,POISON,DAMAGE,OR DON'T AFFECT YOU AT ALL WHEN
   YOU DRINK FROM THEM.
 TRAPS:
  TRAPS CAUSE DAMAGE. THEY MAY BE AVOIDED IF YOU HAVE A GOOD DEXTERITY.
 MONSTERS: THESE ABOUND IN DUNGEONS. THEY DO LEAVE CHESTS WHEN KILLED.
 CHESTS: THESE ARE OFTEN FOUND LYING ABOUND IN DUNGEONS.
 MARKS: THESE ARE NEEDED TO SOLVE THE GAME. THE MARK OF KINGS IS
         FOUND ON THE 1ST LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON EAST OF THE CASTLE.
         OTHER MARKS ARE FOUND ON THE 8TH LEVEL OF DUNGEONS.
 WIND: PUTS OUT YOUR SOURCE OF LIGHT
 GREMLINS: THESE LITTLE BUGGERS STEAL YOUR FOOD. THE WORST THING IS
            THAT YOU CAN'T FIGHT THEM.
 
>>> MARKS:
MARKS ARE NEEDED TO SOLVE THE GAME.
 THE MARK OF KINGS-THIS MARK IS NEEDED TO GET THE KING TO GIVE YOU
  MORE THAN 500 HIT POINTS. IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET 2500 HIT POINTS.
  YOU SHOULD GET THIS MARK FIRST.
 
 THE MARK OF FIRE-THIS MARK ALLOWS YOU TO GET THROUGH FIRE WITHOUT
  BEING DAMAGED.
 
 THE MARK OF FORCE-THIS ALLOWS YOU TO GO THROUGH FORCE FIELDS WITHOUT
  BEING DAMAGED.

 THEH MARK OF THE SNAKE-THIS MARK ALLOWS YOU GO GET PAST THE SNAKE
  AT THE MOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE TO EXODUS. TO GET PAST THE SNAKE
  YOU MUST HAVE THE MARK AND YELL "EVOCARE".

 THE MARKS OF FIRE,FORCE, AND SNAKE ARE FOUND ON THE 8TH LEVEL OF
  DUNGEON SURROUNDED BY FIRE.
 THE MARK OF KINGS IS FOUND ON THE 1ST LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON EAST OF
  YOUR CASTLE.

>>> EXOTICS:
 THESE ARE WEAPONS AND ARMOR THAT CAN BE USED BY ANY RACE AND CLASS.
  THESE ARE REQUIRED TO DEFEAT EXODUS. THEY ARE FOUND ON TWO ISLANDS.
  ONE ISLAND IS A TWO SPACE (MEANING THAT IT TAKES TWO SPACES
  UP-A MONSTER TAKES UP ONE SPACE,A TOWN TAKES UP ONE SPACE).
  IT IS NEAR THE TOWN OF FAWN. IT IS NORTH AND WEST
  OF THE CASTLE. THE OTHER ISLAND IS SOUTH OF THE CASTLE.
  IT IS ALSO A TWO SPACE. IT IS WEST OF THE ROW OF "A'S".
 
>>> HORSES:
 THESE ARE  A GREAT AID TO YOU. THEY LET YOU MOVE ABOUT TWICE AS FAST
  AS MONSTERS. HOWEVER THEY DON'T APPEAT IN THE COMBAT MODE. MOVING
  TWICE AS FAST AS MONSTERS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A GREAT THING,BUT
  YOU'LL BE THANKFUL FOR IT WHEN YOU HAVE TEN MONSTERS BEHIND YOU
  WHILE YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD FROM YOU HOME BASE,
  YOU'RE DOWN TO A LOW NUMBER OF HIT POINTS,AND YOUR OUT OF
  FOOD.
 HORSES COST ABOUT 800 GOLD PIECES AT STORES.
 YOU CAN GET FREE HORSES BY GOING TO FAWN. 1ST,GET THREE BOATS.
  LINE THEM UP IN A BOAT BRIDGE FROM THE MAINLAND TO FAWN. NEXT,
  USING THE BOAT BRIDGE,WALK TO FAWN. THEN ENTER FAWN AND CROSS
  THE BRIDGE ACCROSS THE WATER. NOW HEAD NORTH. GET ON THE HORSE
  YOU SEE AT THE NORTHERN PART OF THE ISLAND BY BOARDING IT. GO
  BACK THE WAY YOU CAME WITH THE HORSE. GALLOP OVER THE BOAT BRIDGE
  TO THE MAINLAND. EXIT THE HORSES. GO BACK TO FAWN AND GET THE
  HORSE AGAIN. KEEP DROPPING THE HORSES ON THE MAINLAND UNTIL YOU
  THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH.
 HORSES ARE DESTROYED IF THE PARTY IS DISPERSED.
 
>>> DAWN:
 THIS TOWN IS THE CITY OF MYTH AND MAGIC. IT HAS MAGICAL WEAPONS AND
  ARMOR FOR SALE AT ITS STORES. IT HAS A THIEVE'S TOOLS,HEALING,
  RATIONS,STABLE,WEAPONS,AND ARMOR STORES. IT HOLDS CLUES AS TO
  WHERE TO DIG FOR EXOTICS. IT HAS ALL OF ITS GUARDS AT ITS ONE
  ENTRANCE/EXIT.
 THIS TOWN ONLY APPEARS ONCE IN A MOON CYCLE. WHEN THE TWO NUMBERS
  AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN SHOW "0,0",THEN DAWN APPEARS. IT IS
  35 SPACES SOUTH AND 8 WEST OF THE CASTLE. COUNT THE ROW OF "A'S"
  AS A SPACE. WHIN IT FIRST APPEARS,YOU HAVE 3 MOVES TO GET IN.
 
>>> EXODUS:
 TO WIN THE GAME YOU MUST KILL OFF EXODUS. EXODUS IS A COMPUTER
  COMPRISED OF 4 IN 1. TO DEFEAT EXODUS YOU NEED THE 4 CARDS.
  THESE CARDS ARE FOUND AT THE 4 SHRINES. LOCATION OF EXODUS-
  EXODUS IS LOCATED IN A CASTLE. THIS CASTLE IS WEST OF FAWN.
  LOOK FOR THE CHANNEL WITH THE SILVER SNAKE BLOCKING THE WAY.
  YOU NEED A BOAT TO GET TH THE SILVER SNAKE. TO GET PAST THE
  SILVER SNAKE YOU MUST HAVE THE MARK OF THE SNAKE. TO GET PAST
  THE SNAKE HAVE THE CHARACTER WITH THE MARK OF THE SNAKE YELL
  "EVOCARE" WHILE HE IS ON THE BOAT DIRECTLY SOUTH OF THE SNAKE.
 BEFORE ATTACKING EXODUS:
  MAKE SURE ALL OF THE ATTACKING CHARACTERS HAVE AT LEAST 300
  RATIONS EACH.
  MAKE USE OF ALL FOUR SPACES FOR CHARACTER (BRING 4 CHARACTERS).
  MAKE SURE ALL FORU CHARACTERS HAVE 2500 HIT POINTS.
  MAKE SURE ALL SPELL USERS HAVE MAXIMUM INTELLIGENCE AND/OR
  WISDOM.
  MAKE SURE ALL SPELL USERS HAVE MAXIMUM SPELL POINTS READY.
  MAKE SURE ** EVERYONE ** HAS EXOTICS.
  ARM ** EVERYONE ** WITH EXOTICS. THE ONLY THAT WILL HIT
  ANYTHING INSIDE OF THE CASTLE IS EXOTICS.
  HAVE ** EVERYONE ** WEAR EXOTIC ARMOR.
  SPELLS WORK AS USUAL. HOWEVER NEGATING TIME EITHER WITH A SPELL
  OR A POWDER DOESN'T WORK.
  MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF KEYS AND GEMS.
  MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS CAN CAST CLERIC
  SPELL "B".
  MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE CHARACTER WITH A LOT OF MONEY
  THAT YOU'RE NOT TAKING INSIDE THE CASTLE. HE CAN PAY THE
  HEALERS TO RAISE THE OTHER CHARACTERS FROM THE DEAD WHEN THEY
  DIE.
  MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE MARK OF FORCE AND THE MARK OF
  FIRE.
  MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE CARDS OF DEATH,LOVE,MOONS,
  AND SOL.
  MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IN THE PARTY HAS A LOT OF MONEY.
  MAKE SURE THAT THE PARTY IS COMPRISED OF YOUR BEST CHARACTERS.
  MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A BOAT.
 
>>> INSIDE THE CASTLE:
 WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER THE CASTLE,GET INSIDE THE CASTLE AWAY FROM
  THE GRASS AS SOON AS YOU CAN. THE GRASS IS ALIVE AND IT WILL
  ATTACK YOU.
 YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE BRICK FLOOR LIGHTS UP ONE SPACE AT A TIME
  JUST ABOUT EVERYTIME YOU DO SOMETHING. WHEN YOU ARE HIT BY IT
  ALL PARTY MEMBERS WILL BE DAMAGED AS IF BY A SHIP.
 ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE,AWAY FROM THE GRASS,PEER AT A GEM. EXODUS
  IS AT THE VERY TOP MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN. SOUTH OF IT IS A
  LARGE AMOUNT OF FIRE AND FORCE FIELD. PLAN THE MOST DIRECT
  ROUTE TOWARD IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO ONE SIDE BEFORE YOU HEAD NORTH
  (I.E. YOU CAN'T GO STRAIGHT NORTH. THERE'S SOMTHING CALLED
  A WALL IN YOUR WAY). TO THE EAST THERE'S A FORCE FIELD WITH
  TWO TRAGON-LIKE MONSTERS BEHIND IT.
  YOU'LL HAVE TO ALLOW THEM TO HIT YOU WITH THEIR BREATH WEAPONS
  WHEN YOU APPROACH THEM. DON'T BOTHER TAKING THE CHESTS ONCE YOU KILL THEM.
CONTINUE TO HEAD EAST THEN FOLLOW THE CORRIDOR NORTH.
A BALRON WILL START TO FOLLOW YOU AFTER YOU'VE BEEN GOING NORTH
  FOR A WHILE. KEEP HEADING NORTH. THE BALRON WILL CATCH UP TO
  YOU UNLESS YOU'VE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO BRING A HORSE WITH YOU.
  DON'T BOTHER GOING INTO THE END OF THE CORRIDOR THAT THE BALRON CAME FROM.
  IT'S A DEAD END.
KEEP HEADING NORTH. WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN GO
  WEST, GO WEST.
KILL OFF THE DRAGON IN THE WAY. IT SHOULD BE IN BETWEEN TWO
  FORCE FIELDS RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH.
KEEP HEADING WEST UNTILL YOU'RE DIRECTLY SOUTH OF A LARGE AMOUNT
  OF FORCE FIELDS AND FIRE. GO THROUGH THEM.
STOP WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE BRICK FLOOR AND THE
  FIRE MEET. WAIT THERE UNTILL THE FLOOR ATTACKS YOU. YOU
  SHOULD KILL OFF THE FLOOR ABOUT 3 TIMES. YOU MAY HAVE
  TO MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THE FLOOR ATTACKS YOU 3 TIMES.
AT THIS POINT, ** YOU ARE DIRECTLY SOUTH OF EXODUS **. DON'T START
  CELEBRATING YET. JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO
  SOLVE ULTIMA III, AND YOU'RE STILL THANKING GOD THAT SOMEONE
  WAS NICE ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU THIS CHEAT-SHEET,THATS NO
  REASON TO GET EXCITED. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE
  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KILL EXODUS. I MEAN,WHY SHOULD
  I TELL A SCUM LIKE YOU HOW TO SOLVE THIS? JUST BECAUSE I
  SPENT LONG,AGONIZING HOURS GETTING EXPERIENCE AND GOLD
  AND MARKS AND LITTLE CLUES THAT WERE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE
  PLACE,WHILE A FREELOADER LIKE YOU GETS A SHEET LIKE THIS,
  I MEAN,I'VE TOLD YOU ** EVERYTHING ** ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE ULTIMA III.
  EVERYTHING THAT IS,EXCEPT HOW TO KILL EXODUS. WOULDN'T
  YOU LIKE TO KNOW? GUESS WHAT? IF YOU INSERT THE WRONG CARD
  INTO THE WRONG PANEL,IN THE WRONG SEQUENCE,THE CHARACTER
  INSERTING THE CARD WILL DIE. OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A CLERIC
  OR SOMETHING THAT CAN RESURRECT OR RECALL PEOPLE,THAN YOU CAN
  KEEP ON GOING. OF COURSE,THE FLOOR WILL KEEP ON LIGHTING UP
  AND YOU'RE FOOD MIGHT RUN OUT,BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE
  WHO CAN RAISE THE DEAD,THEN AT LEAST YOUHAVE THE GUY WITH
  A LOT OF MONEY WHO WASN'T WITH THE PARTY IN THE CASTLE TO
  PAY THE HEALERS TO RAISE YOU GUYS FROM THE DEAD. AND I BET
  THAT A SCUM LIKE YOU PROBABLY HAS A CHEAT DISK,SO THAT YOU
  DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO INTO THE DUNGEONS,OR TO THE SHRINES,
  OR EVEN HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET EXPERIENCE AND EXOTICS,
  WHILE I ON THE OTHER HAND,SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO SOLVE THIS.
  AND THING OF THE POOR GUY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE
  A CHEAT DISK FOR ULTIMA III,JUST THINK OF LORD BRITISH AND
  ALL OF THE TIME HE SPENT MAKING THIS PROGRAM,AND YOU PROBABLY
  HAVE A PIRATED VERSION. YOU'RE AN ENEMY TO CAPITALISM,
  YOU'RE A LAW-BREAKER,YOU'RE A STINKING,NO-GOOD,DIRTY,LOUSY,
  S.O.B. (SON OF A BALRON). GUYS LIKE YOU MAKE GOOD COMMIES.
  WELL GUESS WHAT,YOU STINKING TRAITORTO THE UNITED STATES OF
  AMERICA,I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO DESTROY EXODUS.
  I'M SICK OF SCUM LIKE YOU UNDERMINING THE GREAT NATION OF
  THE UNITED STATES. SCUM LIKE YOU HELPED ORGANIZE THE ANTI-
  NUKE RALLIES. SO I HOPE YOU GO CRAZY TRYING TO SOLVE THIS
  PROGRAM,JUST LIKE I DID. HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,
  HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,. THEY'RE COMING TO GET ME NOW.
  LONG LIVE THE FREE WORLD.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
FINIAL STEPS...
INSERTING CARDS INTO EXODUS:
 I'M ALL RIGHT KNOW. THEY LET ME OUT OF THE INSTITUTION. NOW I
  CAN TELL YOU HOW TO SOLVE THE VERY LAST PART OF ULTIMA III.
  AFTER KILLING THE FLOOR,GO RIGHT UNDER EXODUS. LOOK AT IT
  JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. IF IT SAYS
  "EXODUS" THAN YOUR THERE! LOOK AT FIG. 1

:---:---:---:---:
: 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 :
:---:---:---:---:

 GO TO THE SPACE DIRECTLY UNDER BOX 1. THE FIGURE REPRESENTS
  EXODUS. BOX 1 IS THE WESTERMOST PART OF EXODUS. HAVE THE
  CHARACTER WITH THE CARDS TO THE FOLLOWING...
    1) INSERT (THIS IS AN OTHER COMMAND) NORTH
    2) WHEN IT ASKS "D,S,L,M",TYPE IN "L"
    3) MOVE TO EXODUS SPACE #2 AND INSERT CARD "S"
    4) MOVE TO EXODUS SPACE #3 AND INSERT CARD "M"
    5) MOVE TO EXODUS SPACE #4 AND INSERT CARD "D"

 AT THIS POINT EITHER EXODUS IS DESTROYED,IN WHICH CASE A PARAGRAPH
  STATING THIS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,OR,ONE OR MORE OF
  YOUR CHARACTERS IS DEAD. IF THE LATTER HAS HAPPENED,I CAN'T
  DO ANYTHING EXCEPT EXPRESS MY CONDOLENCES TO THEIR NEXT OF KIN.

                    ::::::>> WALKTHROUGH <<::::::


Ok, since I've been getting TONS of netmail asking me to, I decided to write
this to help all you stuck Ultima fans out there.  I've seen a couple solves
floating around already, but they were shaky at best, so here it goes...

: Note :  There are essentially two ways to go about this game.  You can either
follow Elizabeth and Abraham's trails and work on solving the murders, or you
can cut to the chase and do the important stuff.  I decided to tell you how to
chase E&A, which takes a little longer, but gives you more enjoyment of the plot
development.


::: TRINSIC ::: You appear in Trinsic.  Search the stables and get the key.  Use
it on the chest in the dead guy's house (west side of town).  The scroll is your
first clue that the Fellowship is not what they claim to be.  Talk to the
victim's son, Spark, and Gilberto in the healer's.  Talk to the mayor and get
permission to investigate outside of Trinsic.  If any of you have "lost" your
documentation, drop me some email and I'll send you a patch that will
bypass the protection scheme in Trinsic.

::: BRITAIN ::: Skip Paws and go to Britain.  Talk to Lord British, get the Orb
of the Moons (VERY useful).  He'll tell you to find Rudyom in Cove.  Talk to
Batlin at the Fellowship, and tell him you want to join the Fellowship.  Take
the package to give to Elynor in Minoc.  Also talk to the mayor, Millie, Gordon,
and Clint, the shipwright.  You will learn the Elizabeth and Abraham have gone
to Minoc.  Following this little goose chase is a good way to follow through on
what you need to do to finish the game.  Also visit the museum and acquire the
moonstones (I like Iolo's little comments on this... :)  I would also get the
Mark and Recall spells as soon as you are able.

::: COVE ::: Talk to Rudyom, get the wand and 4 pieces of blackrock.  Read his
notebook.  If you're a softie, talk to the girl at the shrine, she's a sure
thing. :)

::: MINOC ::: Surprise, surprise, another murder... Go to the sawmill ASAP.
Talk to everyone outside.  Get the dagger from the murder scene.  If you really
wanna learn about the Fellowship, open the package before giving it to Elynor.
You can still give it to her and Batlin will be a little miffed, but he'll still
let you join.  Talk to Margareta, learn your fortune.  Most of what follows will
help you fulfill your destiny.  You will also learn in Minoc that Elizabeth and
Abraham have gone to Paws.

NOTE : Solving all of the little town mysteries is not necessary to finish the
game (a couple are, but most are just for kicks).  If you're into maximum game
enjoyment, then I recommend you take the time to solve them.

:: PAWS ::  Talk to Feridwyn.  He'll say E&A (Eliz. and Abraham) have gone to
Jhelom.  You can stay and solve the little "missing venom" mystery if you like.
It will give you practice on how to deal with people and get information from
them.  Head to Jhelom.  If you can't afford a ship by now, go to the western
entrance to the dungeon Despise (next the Lost Lake surrounded by mountains NW
of Britain) and get the flying carpet.  Follow north shore of the river that
feeds the lake and it will be sitting there.  Very useful item (and it's free!).
While you're in Paws, buy the hourglass from Beverlea and keep it in a safe
place.

:: JHELOM ::  Talk to Joseph the mayor.  He says E&A have left for Britain (of
course).  While you are here, talk to DeSnel about the serpentine dagger you
found in Minoc.  You can solve the mystery with Sprellic and the banner of
Honor, but it's not necessary.  Keep in mind that killing townsfolk is ok ONLY
if they attack you first.

:: BRITAIN (again) ::  Go to Britain again and talk to Batlin.  He'll tell you
to go to Destard and find some Fellowship gold.  Destard is located to the SW of
paws on the west side of the mountains.  You don't have to go in, just go near
it.  It's PACKED with treasure and gems and dragons, so be careful.
(Invisibility is almost a MUST here).  There are also some glass swords in there
(save at least one for later...).  Go back to Britain, and join the Fellowship
at 9pm that night (don't listen to your friends).  There is another
documentation scheme here.  Batlin will ask you 2 of 3 random questions I've
seen.  Ginseng must be boiled 40 times and Mandrake can be found in 2 places in
Britannia.  I think the answer to the picture question is 6.  Trial and error
will help if that's the wrong answer.  Make sure you wear your Fellowship
amulet, it will effect the way some characters treat you.  Looks like E&A have
headed towards Vesper.

:: VESPER ::  Find Auston the mayor.  He's not a Fellowship branch leader, but
he has talked to E&A.  He will refer you to Cador, who tells you they went to
Moonglow.  This is an interesting town.  Be careful what you say if you go into
the gargoyle tavern...

:: MOONGLOW ::  Very important city... Talking to Rankin, the Fellowship branch
leader, will reveal that E&A have moved on (surprise surprise) to Terfin, the
island home of the Gargoyles.  While you are here you need to awaken Penumbra
who has been asleep since your last visit to Britannia.  Next to the door of her
house is a plaque.  By reading it repeatedly, you will learn how to open the
door (by placing a hammer, gold ring, lockpick, spindle of thread, and some
other form of gold next to the plaque).  This will open the door.  Once in side,
awaken Penumbra with your Awaken cantrip or by using a potion.  She will say she
needs some blackrock to shield her room before she can continue to help you.
Well, what do you know?  If you've followed along closely, you should have 4
chunks of it with you.  Put them on the pedestals in her room and talk to her
again.  She will tell you to find the Ethereal Ring.  This would be a good place
to cast a Mark spell so you can return when you've found the Ring.  Terfin would
be a good place to start.

:: TERFIN ::  Talk to everyone, especially Draxinusom and Quan.  E&A have headed
to the Meditation Retreat.  You can solve the altar conspiracy here if you like,
but it's not necessary.  You will also learn that the Ethereal Ring is on the
isle of Spektran (NW of Terfin).  You will get the ring later.

:: MEDITATION RETREAT ::  If you go to the Retreat (NOT necessary at this point,
you will return later...) you will learn that Ian will only permit entrance to
Fellowship members (which you are, I hope...).  You will learn that E&A have
gone to Buccaneer's Den.  Before you pursue them any further you must find the
omniscient Time Lord.  The first step is to go to Empath Abbey west of Yew.

:: EMPATH ABBEY ::  Talk to Taylor the monk.  He will tell you about the Emps
that live in the woods.  If you've seen them, you'll know they won't speak to
you (unless you have some honey).  Go to the Bee Cave and get two or three
clumps of honey.  The Bee Cave is no big deal.  I found that you could basically
run right through the bees and they won't really give a shit.  Use the smoke
bomb if you get in trouble.

:: EMPS & WOODS ::  With the honey, you are able to talk to Trellek the Emp
about finding the Wisps.  If you're having troubles finding the Emps, look for
the giant white Silverleaf trees in the woods.  Trellek will need permission
from Saralek who needs permission from Solomon, the Emp leader.  Solomon will
give you a written agreement to have Ben the woodsman sign to stop the
destruction of the Silverleaf trees.  Ben's cabin is on the very western edge of
the forest near the shore.  When you've gotten the treaty signed, Solomon will
grant you permission to take Trellek to the Wisps, but Saralek changes her mind.
Instead of going with you, Trellek will give you a whistle to call the Wisps
with (that was easy, huh? :)  Head to Spiritwood to find the Wisps (near
Destard).  They can also be found in the abandoned fortress they've inhabited
somewhere near Yew woods.

:: THE WISPS ::  Blow the whistle when you're near a Wisp and it will talk to
you.  They will offer you information if you bring them Alagner's notebook.
They will also give you valuable information on the Guardian.  Off to New
Magincia!

:: NEW MAGINCIA ::  Alagner will agree to give you his notebook if you answer
the questions of Life and Death.  This must be done by asking the Tortured One
in Skara Brae.
It might save time if you Mark Alagner's house so you can return his notebook
quickly later.  If you haven't acquired a Seance spell yet, go get one and head
towards Skara Brae on foot.

:: SKARA BRAE ::  Use the Seance spell and hitch a ride from the Ferryman.
Destroyed by an accidental fire, Skara Brae is home of the Dead.  Talk to
everyone (especially Mordra).  Make sure you pick up the Mandrake Essence (the
glowing potion), an empty vial, a curing potion, and potion of Invisibility at
Mordra's pad.  Go to the Smithy and talk to Trent.  Take the music box and go to
the Dark Tower in the NW edge of the isle.  Use the music box near Rowena and
take her ring to Trent.  Take the finished cage and go to the Alchemist's.
Caine won't answer the questions until you destroy the Liche.  Plug the three
potions and the empty vial into the thingamajig and turn the burner on.  If you
did it right, a sparkling blue potion should fill up the vial.  Take that and
the cage to the Dark Tower.  Go to the back of the Tower (through the fake wall
by the stairs) and use the cage on the Well.  Go to the throne room and wait for
midnight.  When Horance lies down, plop the cage over him and use the potion.
Horance says you need to find someone to sacrifice.  Talk to Forsythe the mayor.
Now you get to find and talk to EVERYONE in the town, including those who you've
talked to already.  After everyone refuses to sacrifice themselves, Forsythe
will agree.  Take him to the Well and destroy it.  Go to Caine and learn that
there are NO answers to Life and Death (you MUST still do this).

:: TIME LORD :: Go to New Magincia, and tell him there are no Answers.  Get the
key, find the notebook in his storeroom and take it to the Wisps.  Use your Orb
to beam to the Time Lord.  He will direct you to the dungeon Despise to destroy
the ether-screwing generator.  Before you can follow up on this, you need to
destroy the generator found in Deceit.  In order to do this, you need the
aforementioned Ethereal Ring (ie Spektran!).  If you go to Alagner's to return
his notebook, you'll find him dead (very dead, actually).  Use his crystal ball
and you'll get your first glimpse at the much sought Elizabeth, Abraham, Hook,
and Forskis...

:: SPEKTRAN ::  The door to the Sultan's place should open when you approach it.
As you will see, the Sultan is somewhat of a loony.  You need to kill his harpy
and take its key.  The harpy can be easily killed using invisibility or a glass
sword (make sure you still have at least one glass sword when you leave here.
It's ok if you don't, but it will save you much heartache later...).  To reach
the room with the ring you need to stack the crates on the table (three high I
think...).  Now head to Moonglow and have Penumbra enchant the ring.

:: DECEIT ::  This dungeon isn't too tough, but what's inside the generator IS.
Follow all the hallways and find the false walls (try walking into the dark
areas and you'll see what I mean).  You can talk to the Cyclops if you want, but
it's not necessary.  Before you approach the generator, drop all your party
members and put on the Ring.  Inside the generator is the ugliest, toughest
fucker in the whole game (he's the one you've been saving the glass sword for).
I didn't have any more glass swords by the time I got here and still killed him,
so don't fret.  By cornering him and using LOTS of healing and protection
potions, you can do it with any magical weapon.  Click on the box in the middle
of the room and watch as the generator collapses.  There should be a miniature
tetrahedron sitting on the ground.  GET IT and get out of Deceit.  Now Nicodemus
(in the "chessboard house" in Yew) is able to enchant your hourglass, which is
needed to approach the next generator in Despise.

:: DESPISE ::  DON'T enter the northeastern entrance to Despise.  It's good for
experience, but not necessary.  Use the entrance on the Lake (the one where you
found the flying carpet).  I won't get into the details of Despise, but you need
to get around the teleporters and follow the tunnels east of the entrance.  The
tunnels will burrow around to the SW side of the lake and you'll find the
Spherical Generator.
You'll find a moongate puzzle inside.  The correct sequence is RED, BLUE, BLUE,
RED.  Pick up the small Sphere and leave (via Recall if possible :)  One more
generator to go!

:: MEDITATION RETREAT AGAIN ::  This place is pretty much a bore, except for the
cave that you're not allowed to enter (ooo! are you shaking??).  By this point
in the game you should have gotten a feel for what the Fellowship is about
(nothing good, that's for sure...).  In the cave is the Cube generator.  You
won't be able to approach it, but you should Mark it so you can beam back later.
After reaching the Cube, contact the Time Lord by using the hourglass.  He will
tell you to find a mineral called Caddellite.  This is found on the Isle of
Ambrosia.

:: AMBROSIA ::  This island is kinda hidden.  It's located in the NE sea of
Britannia.  If you've been using the map from the game package or the one found
in the game itself, you won't be able to see Ambrosia because it's under the
little compass icon in the upper right corner.  It's a large island and
shouldn't be too hard to find.  Inside a cave on this island is where the
Caddellite is found.  It's guarded by a three headed Hydra.  Surprisingly the
Hydra is huge wimp and croaks quickly in combat.  You'll need one chunk of
Caddellite per party member (or just one if you plan on approaching the Cube
alone.  You can't take your party members inside anyway...).  Take the
Caddellite to Zorn in Minoc and he will fashion helmets for you.

:: MEDITATION RETREAT again :::  Beam back to the Cube and go inside wearing
your special helmet.  The puzzle inside involves walking on certain spots of the
walkway that trigger the bridges to other parts.  Trouble is, some spots remove
other bridges as well.  I could go on for a page or two on how to solve it, but
it would be easier just to tell you to save the game a lot and do it yourself.
It's hard, but not impossible.  Just look out for the fire fields and fireballs.
Another hint: you'll cover almost 100% of the walkways before you're able to get
to the center.  After the Cube crumbles, take the little cube and head to
Buccaneer's Den.

:: BUCCANEER'S DEN ::  Now you're after the ever elusive E&A and the killer
Hook.  Possession of the little Cube forces the truth out of people who would
normally lie to you (ie most people in Bucc. Den...).  Talking to Danag at the
Fellowship Branch will reveal much about Hook, Elizabeth, Abraham, and the
fucked up Fellowship.  Talk to Sintag at the House of Games and get the key from
him.  The door in the Games leads into the mountain passages where Hook's
hideout is.  In his hideout, you'll find the navigational plans for the ever
elusive Crown Jewel, and the Black Gate key used to get past the barrier on the
Isle of the Avatar.  Also in his hideout is a list of people the Fellowship has
eliminated (with you and ol' LB yet to go).  There's nothing much else in those
tunnels, except for a some torture chambers used by the Fellowship and a couple
worthless prisoners.  Off to the Black Gate!

:: ISLE OF THE AVATAR ::  If you're not 8th level by this time and able to cast
some major kickass spells, you might want to do some experience-collecting
before going here.  The key from Hook's place will allow you to pass the barrier
on the south side of the island and get into the dungeon.  This dungeon is
rather long and hard.  A couple tips:

     - It is not necessary to kill the dragon.  Lots of
       cool goodies though! (ie a Glass Sword that will be
       handy  soon)

     - The Chair of Change teleports you to one of 3 places
       in the dungeon if you sit in it.  At each location it
       takes you, examine all the walls for hidden passages.

     - Sitting in the Throne of Virtue (or whatever its
       called) will make the Chair of Change take you to a
       fourth place, necessary to get to the Gate.

     - In the "Fellowship Hall" try fiddling with the
       medallion.

     - Watch out for the Paladin guarding one of the last
       doors, he's an asskicker (use a Glass Sword if you
       have one...).

     - Take the mage's spellbook from his room.  It's
       fully loaded!

     - If you still can't find the Black Gate room, try
       looking for any keys you might have missed.  Also
       poke on every wall you see, there's lots of
       illusionary walls.

:: THE BLACK GATE ::  Ah, the gang's all here!  After some little bickering,
they will attack you.  I had troubles winning this battle hand-to-hand until I
found a useful little spell called Death Vortex.  If you use it, DON'T cast it
on an enemy.  Cast it on YOURSELF.  This spell is useful to say the least.
After everyone croaks (except the little weasel Batlin) you'll be left with the
choice of returning home, or using Rudyom's Wand (you still have it I hope!) on
the Gate.  The animated sequence at the end of the game is kinda short, but
_completely_ amazing.


Ok people, that's it.  Mucho regards to Mr. Gariott and Origin for making such
an incredible game.  Ultima VIII is supposed to be out next summer, so keep
yer eyes peeled.  If anyone has any further questions, drop me a note!

Uninvited Part 1
----------------
By Kiran S. Kedlaya

     Welcome to the walkthrough for Uninvited. If you are reading this, 
chances are you have Uninvited. So let's get down to business. 

     LOOKOUT! Hmm... wonder what that black shape was. Anyway, your car's a 
wreck, your brother's gone, and I think I smell gas. What a way to start 
the day. Speaking of gas, I'd get out of the car. 

     Boom! Oh well, you can't win 'em all. Your brother is probably inside 
that creepy mansion. But don't go in yet. Open the mailbox and read the 
mail. You don't need the letter (just keep track somehow of what it said), 
but hang on to the amulet. Now open the door, and go through. 

     This place is not exactly a comfy environment, but no time to worry 
about that now. You must be exhausted; why don't you have a seat. (Try 
everything you can sit on.) Ouch! Something sharp must be in that chair. 
But since we can't open it yet, you'll have to leave it alone. Now that you 
have a choice of two exits, take the door on the right. 

     This small room isn't too important, but that book is. Take down the 
definitions inside (if you're curious, those words are Latin), and leave. 
Now that you're back here in this entrance hall, take the door on top (from 
now on, exits will be referred to by their position in the Exits window). 

     Though it doesn't look it at first, this would be a good place to save 
your position. Why? You'll see in a minute. Open any of the doors except 
the one on the top right (that's the one you just came through). Voila! A 
Scarlett O'Hara lookalike. But definitely not a Scarlett O'Hara actalike, 
as you'll notice very shortly. Now do anything. Whoops! That Scarlett's a 
killer. We'll deal with her shortly, but for now open that saved game (you 
DID save your game before this, didn't you?) and go upstairs. 

     Welcome to what is known as a six-way junction. There's quite a bit to 
explore up here, so let's go one door at a time, starting at the lower 
right door. Open it up and go through. 

     Well, well, well, a storage closet. Who'd store anything in this 
place, anyway? In any case, most of this stuff is pretty useless, but 
examine the things to find out what you need. 

     What's this, a bottle of No-Ghost? Well, we DO have a ghost to kill 
downstairs, but for now, just open it up and hang on to it. Also keep the 
Spider Cider handy. Now you can leave the same way you came in, and use the 
next door, on the middle right. 

     That axe may be very useful, if you're a psychotic, or you want to 
finish the game, so drag it into the inventory. Don't go up the stairs, but 
if you must, save your game here and climb up those stairs. Open the cell 
door and go inside. Uh-oh... Time to open that saved game, and leave the 
way you came. Now we go through the door on the top right. But since the 
radio doesn't work, there's no time to sleep, and the star in the dresser 
will soon be superseded by a better model, we might as well leave. 

     Next, the top left door. Well, here's a book for us to read! Let's 
read it... Not much interesting there, but what about this nightstand? 
Examine it. "The solid-looking nightstand makes a hollow ring when you 
knock on it." I wonder why... Maybe it is hollow! Try opening it. That 
cigar-type object is really a scroll. Open that too and examine it. Those 
six words should sound familiar. They're in that book we read some turns 
back! If you wrote down the definitions (and I hope you did), you will be 
able to translate those words as "Talking head" and a magic word, and 
"Instant light" and a magic word. Those are spells that can be cast on 
objects. But you just need to know the words, so leave the scroll where it 
is and use the door in the top right corner. 

     Hmm, no toilet in this bathroom. Maybe it was used for something 
else... But anyway, examine the various objects in here, specifically that 
funny-looking light on the ceiling. Looks grippable, the game says. Maybe 
we can open it... but we can't reach it right now, so just go back out into 
the upstairs hallway. Now we'll go through the final unused door on the 
bottom left. Look, another book! (Hey, that rhymes!) Open it up and take 
down what's inside. "My servant sealed his star inside my hingeless box." 
Hmm.. where's the box? "I've hidden the key, a chair knows where." And if 
you interpreted that correctly, you should know where, too. But at this 
point, open that cabinet. Or rather, try. It seems to be locked, but we 
know where the key is, so go out and head back downstairs. Now in the hall, 
go back to the entrance hall (the door on the top right, remember?). We can 
now open the chair, but not by Opening it. We have to hack it up. Operate 
the axe on the chair, and presto! a key. Drag that into the inventory. But 
wait, there's a head here. Maybe it talks. Try saying that talking head 
spell (Specan Heafod Abraxas) to the head. "Find your brother!" Wow, quite 
useful, but don't despair. That's not the only talking head around here. At 
this point go to the hall and open one of the doors. 

     There's Scarlett again. But this time we're ready to kill that ghost 
once and for all. Operate the open bottle of No-Ghost on her. That worked 
quite well, and you can drop the No-Ghost, since it's empty. Remember the 
locked cabinet upstairs? We now have a key! So head on upstairs back into 
the master bedroom. Now that we're here, unlock the cabinet and pop it 
open. Well, what's this? Two scrolls, a bottle and a box! First open the 
scrolls, read them and keep track of what's on 'em. 

     Try examining that bottle. The liquid inside seems to be in one piece. 
Ever see any liquids that act like that? I'll give you a hint. It's in 
thermometers... right, it's mercury! And the bottle has a gold cap. 
Recalling one of the scrolls, "Gold, silver, and mercury. Together they 
form a key." But wait, first of all you have no silver, and second of all 
if you did, there would be no way to put them all together. The "key" 
mentioned is not what you think. Let's take a look at the box. Seems to be 
airtight. Maybe we can open it... then again, maybe not. Notice there are 
no hinges on this box, so it's a "hingeless box". Sound familiar? But we 
can't open it... yet, so just drag it into the inventory. 

     By now you'll have noticed a couple of things which haven't been 
addressed here, so I'll address them. The first is that skull which pops 
out of nowhere. The game gives you a certain number of turns in which to 
finish. If you don't finish by then, you're finished for sure. The skull 
just is a reminder of how long you have left. 

     Also, you most likely have seen a little creature run across the 
screen waving a key. Unfortunately, you can't do anything while he's there, 
so anything you do to him must be set up beforehand. And yes, that key is 
useful, but not now. Now it's time to head for the hall. We can go several 
directions here, so you might want to explore the various exits. But 
there's no time to lose, your brother's in danger! 

     As we return to the scene, we find ourselves in the hall. We have 
several ways to proceed, so let's go through the door on the bottom right 
(remember, exits will be referred to by their position in the Exits 
window), taking care to open it first. 

     Hmm... this parlor seems to be totally insignificant. But there is a 
closed door at the top left, so let's proceed. 

     Welcome to a veranda. That spider seems to have some importance. But 
how do we get at him? Remember the bottle in the storage closet? You know, 
the one marked Spider Cider? The "arachnid anesthetizer" could come in very 
handy. Unfortunately for us, he only appears when we come out here, and is 
gone before we can do anything. But how could we set things up so that he'd 
get a dose of Spider Cider while crossing? Perhaps if he stepped in a 
puddle of it, he'd be knocked out. This puddle can be created by spraying 
the Spider Cider on the veranda. Now go back in and come out. Voila! 
Paralyzed spider! We can now pick it up and carry it with us, which you 
should do now before going back to the hall. 

     Back at the hall, it's time to take the upper left door. Food! 
Obviously this place isn't as deserted as you thought. You can grab a bite 
from the bowl if you want, but there's no need. Just grab the flowers, open 
the double doors at the top and proceed through. 

     This place is getting more inhabited by the minute. This study seems 
to have been used a lot, judging from the description of the desk. Open it 
and have a peek. 

     Well, well, well, index cards! These will not be important themselves, 
but make sure you note the information on them. 

     Anyhow, visiting time is over, so go through the door on the top 
right. Whoops! It's locked, but we have a skeleton key, so use it. Oh dear, 
that doesn't seem to work either. But don't worry about it much. Just go 
back the other way to the dining room. This time, take the double doors on 
the top left. 

     Presenting... the kitchen! You're right, it isn't worth a fancy 
leadup. Just take the door on the right. 

     This pantry is reasonably stocked, considering this is a haunted 
mansion. However, since the oven doesn't work (try it yourself), there's 
really nothing important here except the matchbox. At this point, depart 
and take the door on the left from the kitchen. 

     This room seems to belong to someone... but who? You'll see, but for 
now, just look around. Specifically at the light. If you've poked around a 
bit you'll remember that all the lamps around here seem to fail due to lack 
of electricity. But this one doesn't require electricity, so flick it on. 

     Presto! A secret compartment! Also a mean ghost guarding it. To deal 
with him, you'll have to use some object you've picked up already. Just 
keep Operating things on him until... Bam! The spider really touched him 
off, didn't it? Now that we have access to the compartment, open the book 
and read it. Remember its contents: they're important. At this point 
dispose of the spider. "I've hidden the star in Master's special box. It 
never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire it 
freezes, in ice it burns." Poetry aside, this should turn the gears in your 
mind. Master's special box, that never opens? The hingeless box! But wait! 
There's more. If it freezes in fire, and burns in ice, that gives us a way 
to destroy the box without ruining its contents.
     But enough chatter, let's return to the dining room. Now take the door 
on the right back to the hall. Don't worry about the door on the bottom: 
we'll get there anyway. Take the top right door back to the entrance hall. 
We can now use fire to access the contents of the box. Open the matchbook 
and strike a match (operate a match on the matchbook; you can select the 
matchbook by clicking anywhere in the window for the open matchbook). Now 
light the fireplace with this match, before it goes out. Vroom! That 
kindling sure could use the warmth.

      Now for the piece d'resistance. Pop the box in the fire. We now have 
a pentagram. This will be INCREDIBLY useful in time, but for now, just hang 
on to it. Now, go back to the hall and take the final door on the bottom 
left. This seems to be a rec room. Kinda out of place, don't you think? But 
there's no time for nitpicking right now. Try operating the victrola. Oh 
well, one victrola in for repairs... There is the locked cabinet, though. 
Luckily you have a key. Open the cabinet with the key and look inside. That 
doll sure looks interesting, and may have some value to boot.

     Now for the exits. The door on the right leads to the dining room 
(that's the one we didn't take), so go through the door on top. How 
impressive! Skins and heads galore. But this room is "don't touch", so 
hands off the animals. That cage is useful, though. If you carry it around, 
you can put things in and increase the capacity of your inventory! So drag 
it in right away. At this point, take the door on top. Follow the yellow 
brick road... never mind. This junction seems interesting, follow the 
middle brick road.

     Welcome to a greenhouse. Why not go inside? Lots of dead plants 
inhabit this greenhouse. If you examine them carefully, though, one is not 
dead yet. The watering can here only has water for one plant, so water the 
undead plant. At first you shouldn't see any response, but a watched pot 
never boils. Come back later for an update.

     Now go back out to the junction and down the right path. This would be 
a good time to save your game, as you are in immediate danger. Those dogs 
are vicious. You have no means of killing them, but maybe you could scare 
them. Try a little sorcery. Remember the scroll with the Latin words on 
them? One of them translated to "Instant light" and a magic word. Maybe a 
little "instant light" would turn these vicious beasts. Say "Instantum 
Illuminaris Abraxas" to one of the dogs. Now we can go inside. (The bit 
about watching your step is just a red herring.) But step on it, there's no 
time to lose! 

     We find ourselves at Chapel Entrance, freezing in the bitter wind. The 
chapel is obviously a haven from the breeze, so stroll inside. Time to make 
a study of the objects here. Notice the head on the stand. Remember back at 
Entrance Hall, the other head? The one we cast a spell on? If you don't, in 
one of the scrolls were printed six words from the book, in two lines. One 
of these translated to "Instant light", which you've already invoked if 
you've gotten this far. The other one translated to "Talking head". Maybe 
this head talks... Say "Specan Heafod Abraxas" to the head. Zam! The door 
opened. But don't leave yet, there's still work to do. Notice the cross. 
That seems like a handy doodad to have around. Pick it up. 
     
     Well, we have a secret trapdoor here. But don't go there either. 
Examine the candelabra. Maybe we could pick it up... Drag it in (if it 
doesn't fit, open the cage and put things in there). Now save your 
position. Don't ask any questions, just do it. You're at a life-threatening 
position, though it doesn't seem like it.
     Now we can exit two ways. Let's go through the trapdoor. Hmm... what's 
this about a spider? Try again. The game seems intent on keeping you up 
here. Keep trying, and eventually you'll get through. Whoops! There IS a 
spider here! And a very big one at that! Open the saved game and try again. 
This time, though, take the door on the left. Oh oh, this poltergeist won't 
even give you a ghost of a chance. Open the saved game again. Anything we 
do to it must be set up beforehand. Ghosts can be easily frightened, 
strangely. And any creep usually can be warded off by a religious symbol of 
some sort. Look at the candelabra. Notice that it's not lit. Maybe we'd 
have better luck it it were lit. Strike a match (remember, operate it on 
the matchbox) and light the candelabra. Now proceed back through the door. 
That candelabra sure frightened the ghost! 
     
     Anyhow, up ahead is a garden maze, but a very gloomy one. Time to whip 
out the graph paper and head onward into the maze. We now are in a gloomy 
garden maze. Luckily, your sense of direction has actually sharpened, not 
faded. You always will be facing the same direction in the maze. Map any 
way you like. Just wander around, mapping passages and avoiding hazards, 
until something interesting happens. If you happen upon a bunch of zombies, 
run the way you came. There is no way to deal with them. There is one band 
that never moves, but if you do find a bunch, come back again to see if 
they've left. If you find one zombie, you can deal with him (it?) very 
simply. A zombie is, of course, undead. That should ring a bell... Remember 
the letter we read at the very beginning of the game? "The undead fear 
symbology." Remember what came with it? The amulet, of course! Operate it 
on him (it?) for best results. If you find a tombstone or coffin, make a 
note of where it was, but don't worry about it right now. If you've been 
everywhere there is to be, and seen everything there is to see, you'll 
remember there are a few tombstones about. You do have a bunch of flowers, 
but only one. Which tombstone is different from all the rest? The unmarked 
one. Operate the flowers on it. A hidden passage! What luck! Go through it 
right away. 

     Three cages here to distract us. Which one to open? Don't worry, 
there's only one lock. Unlock it with the key. Here would be a good point 
to save your game. One wrong move and you're cat food, snake food and bird 
food simultaneously. The animal we're interested in is the bird, so operate 
the cage on it. What a hungry snake! 

     Now that that's over, take the exit at the bottom (the exit at the 
left leads back to the bunch of zombies). Keep going until you find 
something interesting. Did you see what was under the bouncing creature? If 
you didn't, recall one of the scrolls you found in the Master Bedroom. "The 
heart of the maze contains the Blothney gem." 

     Welcome to the heart of the maze. But we still have a bouncing 
creature to take care of. It looks friendly. Maybe it's hungry. It also 
looks fat enough to be a carnivore. Maybe we can give him a bird to munch 
on... Open the cage to get at the bird. Oh well, it got away. But look! the 
bouncing creature is chasing it. Now we can get at that gem and get out of 
here, which you should do. 

     Now go back to the junction we left earlier and re-enter the 
greenhouse. Look! That plant we watered earlier has born some fruit. Grab 
the plant and go back to the junction. Heading up the left path, we find 
ourselves at Magisterium. That should sound familiar. Remember the book? 
Magisterium translates to "mystery". Now recall the second half of one of 
the scrolls in Master Bedroom. "There are places you cannot go, 'til you 
unlock the 'mystery'." There is a gem-shaped hole in the doorway. Putting 
together the parts of the message, we should be able to unlock the door 
with the Blothney gem. 

     Try it. 

     Open sesame! We can now go inside, which we should do. That demon 
seems more vicious than he is. Maybe he's hungry. But he doesn't seem like 
he'll want any "normal" food. Try feeding him some home-grown food, from 
the greenhouse. There he goes! We are now very near the conclusion of our 
hunt. But as the tension grows, so does the danger, so watch your step (I 
mean it this time!).

     If you've made it this far, you're really close to the end. But as they 
say, it ain't over 'til it's over, so let's go to work. 

     We find ourselves in the Magisterium, at a three-way junction. Let's 
take the door on the right (remember, doorways are referred to by their 
position in the Exits window). 

     This room seems to be some sort of observatory. What varied interests 
the undead have! Nothing here seems to be of interest except the book, so 
take a look. Darnit, that book is in some indecipherable scrawl. Time to 
leave and take the door on the left. 

     Whoops! That door is locked, and you don't have the key. Don't worry, 
you can't get past that door, so go through the top door and take a look. 
Somebody must be doing something important in here (or at least important-
looking). There is a safe here for the opening. But what's the combination? 
Time to invoke one of the messages we read a long time back. The one that 
was in the Master Bedroom... "Gold, silver, and mercury. Together they form 
a key." These three words have appeared elsewhere. I wonder where... yank 
out the list of the information on the cards in the study. The ones that 
had some of the elements on them. Find the numbers of gold, silver, and 
mercury, and string them together with dashes. This is the combination to 
the safe. 

     What's this, a cookie jar inside! Open it. Well, then we'll have to 
open it the hard way. Remember how we "opened" the chair back in the 
entrance hall? Attack the cookie jar with the axe. Voila! One cookie. 
Though you might be tempted, don't eat it. Hang on to it. 

     Remember anybody who seems to have had a sugar rush lately? Been 
acting awfully hyper? The little gremlin you remember taunting you with a 
key can now be faced. But to face him, you'll have to go in the house. Go 
back to the trophy room (or anyplace inside). Now just drop the cookie and 
do something until the demon runs by again. 

     That cookie really WAS tempting! The key he's left you will be very 
handy, so grab it and race back to the room we came back from. The trapdoor 
is a good place to go right now. Open it and descend downwards. It's now 
time to save your game, because you could be in deep trouble if you screw 
up now. 

     Go through the top passage. Yow! This is the same spider you spotted 
from coming through the altar trapdoor. Yes, they are connected. But this 
time, you have time to escape, so come back. Now take the middle passage. 

     Who was that bearded man, anyway? It's time to melt the ice. A fire 
will not do right now, so it's time to invoke some more poetry. Recall the 
rhymes from the servant's diary? "Dracan's star never discerns. In fire it 
freezes, in ice it burns." We found Dracan's star in the hingeless box: the 
pentagram. Since it burns in ice, we can use it to melt this cave. But save 
your position first. Now operate the star on the ice cave. 

     Something's happening, and you'll have to hurry to stop it. Follow the 
body through the top passage into the next cave. 

     Here's the body, and you must get rid of it--as far away as possible. 
Examine the hole in the center of the room. A bottomless pit... that's 
pretty far. Throw the body down it. Now go through the passage near the 
pit, but don't go down the pit, unless you're a masochist. 

     Here we have a wooden door. Open it and... oops, it's locked. Try the 
skeleton key. No luck? Maybe the key we got from the demon will do it... 
Voila! Now open it. Not another creaking door! Go through, and... 

     Omigosh! That's your brother, and his pained screams seem to be coming 
from above. We'll have to go above--upstairs, that is. Go back to the hall 
and take the stairs. 

     You're getting closer, but not yet. We have to go up further. Recall 
the odd light fixture, that looked grippable? Head through the top left 
door and into the bathroom. 

     Somebody wants you here, or something. You're almost there. Now try to 
open the light fixture. 

     Save your game here, because the next step involves some risk. You 
have no way of reaching that light fixture on solid ground. Maybe the 
ground you must be on is liquid... 

     Turn on the water in the tub. No, you can't take a bath, but the water 
is going to gush. Out of the tub, even. This overflow could raise you a 
bit. Try to open the fixture again. 

     Next time, maybe. Keep trying until it finally opens. Now there's no 
time to lose. If you hesitate you'll be all wet. Go through the fixture. 

     A secret room! And your brother!! Examine him. He's delirious. And 
there's a potential escape route in the window. There are three ways to 
proceed here, the easiest of which is to dawdle. But there are faster ways. 

     If you want to take care of your brother first, you'll realize he is 
slightly dizzy, delirious, etc. Time to smack some sense into him. Hit him 
(but NOT with the axe--that has a bit too much effect.) 

     If you'd rather open up an escape route first, open the window. But 
not by opening it, that won't work. You'll have to open it the old-
fashioned way, the way we opened the chair and the cookie jar; hack it up 
with the axe. Either way, a sceptre will come out of your brother, who will 
escape out the window. He's safe: it's now your turn to escape. Save your 
game; one wrong move and you're dead... er, undead. 

     Remember the infamous line in the letter? "The undead fear symbology." 
And usually religious symbology, to boot. What religious symbology do you 
have for him? 

     The cross! Show it to him.

     Whoa! That really did him in. Just go through the window and smell the 
fresh air. 

     You did it! Now wasn't that fun? Don't forget to print out a 
certificate of accomplishment.

 [Part one - Fathers Castle]

 [south],[south],[kill stranger],
 [look stranger],(this will give
 you the silver coin),[south],(now
 in the Land of Wotan, I think
 typing [touch spear] does something
 but I'm not sure, try that and then
 wander [west],[east] until Wotan
 comes around!),[west],[talk
 stranger],(trade your whatever
 with the stranger for 100 gps),
 [east],[south],[d] (for down!)

 Now we will leave this place full
 of gods for now and go down into
 a towney place.

 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part two - Towney Place]

 We must get some food or we are
 going to starve our asses off!

 [west],[south],[east],[go building]
 , [buy food] (ahhhh yes we still
 have an ass! and you better hope you
 traded with that guy or you are
 not going to be able to get food!),
 (Now go back to the place you started
 when you came [d] to the town, by
 reversing your directions),(type
 south I think, but be sure you are
 back up in the land of gods!!!)

 Now back to the land of gods!

 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part three - Back to gods' place]

 Now we gotta find Odins ass and
 tell him we are going to kick it
 in unless...

 I think that you go like [east],
 [north],[north],[east], but I'm
 really not sure.... it will say
 you are in the Land of Odin when
 you get there.

 I'm almost posotive though that once
 you get where the strange was killed
 if you just go [north],[east] that
 you will be there??

 Once in Odin's Land, keep going [east]
 until you find him, he was nice and
 said we could use his name once, so
 we won't have to kick his ass!

 Now go [west] and i think you will
 be where you killed the stranger??
 if not get here, go back into
 wotan land, go west, and I think
 you are by the town?? Or else go south
 or soemnthing, but find where it says
 go down for town, and then go [d].

 *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part 4 - who cares]

 Now go [east],[say odin],(bandits
 are coming up next and he will
 save us so our ass don't get kicked!)
 ,[east],[go castle],[u],[kill
 bandit],[look bandit] (this will
 give you a ring or soemthing, nice
 bandit picture eh?),(now go back
 to the same place where you came
 down from last with I think
 [down],[leave],[south],[west]???
 or something like that!!! Then go
 [west],[west],[west (i think)]
 but find the country side.. from
 the country side go [south],[south],
 [look distance]

 And poofo magico, since we killed
 that bandit it magically teleports
 us to.......> Harbor Place < another
 famous Wyvern place name.

 %*%**%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [part 5 - some harbor place]

 go [south] until you get to the boat
 and then type [look boat],[go boat]
 and this is one part I'm not sure
 about here, you have to sail around
 until you come to the next palce:

 Chasm of Wyvern (named after me!)

 Then onto the next part..

 *%%*%**%*%*%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%**%%**%

 [part 6 - Chasm of Wyvern]

 It's time to say goodbye to para-
 chutes because now you are going
 to jump head first into a pile of
 lava!!!! (???)

 [jump chasm],[turn around],(ahhhh,
 you will go flying down somewhere)
 now you will be in some crappy blue
 picture...move around cuz I don't
 know what to do here either (written
 down I mean) so move around and you
 know you are getting soemwhere when
 you come to the first spot: a dragon!

 This is how i'll show it treks:

 [at dragon]

 attack dragon with sword

 [at balron]

 attack with spear

 (get rid of the dragon on the dragon
 one!)

 [at demon]

 wear amulet

 [at demi-god]

 show runic amulet

Then you come to the beautiful princess
and win the whole damn sun of a you
know....

 look for version two, which will be
 muuuuuch better.
